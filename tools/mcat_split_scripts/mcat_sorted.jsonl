Most leukemia cases involve elevated leukocyte counts. In acute cases of leukemia, immature leukocytes proliferate quickly, which leads to many abnormal immature cells in the bone marrow. This inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce healthy new leukocytes. This form of the cancer progresses rapidly, and the cells metastasize easily as they move into the bloodstream from the bone marrow. It can be fatal within weeks or months if not treated promptly. In contrast, chronic cases of leukemia typically involve the proliferation of abnormal mature leukocytes. This form of the disease progresses more slowly, and treatment need not always be immediate.\nOnce classified as acute or chronic, leukemia can be further subdivided into lymphocytic or myelogenous. This distinction depends on which type of leukocyte is abnormal in the patient. In lymphocytic leukemia, the lymphoid cells, such as the lymphocytes, are abnormal. In the myelogenous form, the myeloid cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils, are affected.\nChemotherapy drugs are often used in the management of leukemia cases. There are numerous categories of these drugs, and they have varied mechanisms of action. In treatment, several drugs are used in combination because some of the drugs are cell-cycle specific while others are not. Alkylating agents are capable of disrupting the function of DNA. Tubulin-binding agents are designed to interfere with microtubule formation. Other drugs are designed to interfere with DNA polymerase, DNA repair mechanisms, or protein synthesis, or to act as purine analogs. Many of these drugs cannot enter into the brain when injected or ingested, so if the cancer has spread to\nthis area, special methods must be used to introduce the drugs to the brain.\nWhat would be the BEST explanation as to why people with chronic forms of leukemia can live longer untreated than those with acute cases of leukemia?", "Answer Candidates": ["Chronic cases involve types of leukocytes that have less important functions in the body.", "Chronic cases of leukemia involve abnormal cell division of mature cells, so there are still some immature cells that can proliferate into normal mature cells.", "The immune system is less likely to recognize and destroy abnormal immature leukocytes than it would be to recognize and destroy abnormal mature leukocytes.", "all of the above"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is B. The passage explains that in acute cases of leukemia, Passage I immature leukocytes are involved. This implies that these immature cells are abnormal and may not proliferate into normal mature leukocytes.

With an extreme increase in water consumption, the plasma and blood volume increases, increasing blood pressure. The kidneys try to deal with this by increasing their filtration rate and increasing urine production to try to eliminate some of the excess water and reduce blood volume and pressure. What should not happen in this situation is to increase the retention of water in the body. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) normally increases water reabsorption in the nephron.

Sperm cells are haploid, and all are genetically different from each other and from other cells in the body. Because they are genetically different, they should express unique surface antigens. If the cells of the immune system were to contact the sperm, they would be perceived as foreign and could be subject to immune system attack, which would destroy the sperm. For this reason, the blood-testis barrier is required to keep the sperm away from the immune cells. The remaining choices do not make good sense. Sperm cells will eventually leave the reproductive system during ejaculation. It also would not make sense to indicate that the blood flow to the testes needs to be cut off.

{"Problem Number": "1_0_27", "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "\nEndothelin is a vasoactive peptide involved in a variety of processes, including the control of blood flow. Endothelin is capable of binding to two different receptors. There are receptors for endothelin located on smooth muscle (ETA) and receptors for endothelin located on vascular endothelium (ETB). When endothelin binds to ETA, it initiates vasoconstriction by narrowing blood vessels. However, when endothelin binds to ETB, vasodilation occurs due to the widening of blood vessels. The activity of the ETB receptor seems to counterregulate the ETA effects and prevents excessive vasoconstriction.\nDrug $X$ is a selective receptor antagonist for endothelin. It is designed to bind preferentially to certain endothelin receptors. Drug $\\mathrm{Y}$ is another selective receptor antagonist for endothelin. It is also designed to preferentially bind to one of the endothelin receptors. Researchers are hopeful that drugs $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$ will be of value in the treatment of conditions such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In PAH, excess endothelin is produced, which causes an increase in blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries. Normal pressure in the pulmonary arteries is expected to be about $14 \\mathrm{~mm} \\mathrm{Hg}$, and pressure at or above $25 \\mathrm{~mm}$ Hg constitutes PAH. Both drugs have been tested in patients with PAH. There were five patients in each group. At the end of the study, the percent decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure was measured for each patient and reported in the table.\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n\\hline Patient & Drug X & DrugY & Placebo \\\\\n\\hline 1 & $+10 \\%$ & $-10 \\%$ & $+5 \\%$ \\\\\n2 & $+3 \\%$ & $-5 \\%$ & $0 \\%$ \\\\\n3 & $-5 \\%$ & $+2 \\%$ & $+13 \\%$ \\\\\n4 & $+2 \\%$ & $0 \\%$ & $-4 \\%$ \\\\\n5 & $0 \\%$ & $-7 \\%$ & $-2 \\%$ \\\\\nAverage decrease & $+2 \\%$ & $-4 \\%$ & $+2.4 \\%$ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\nIf a patient has PAH, the heart can become overly stressed which can ultimately lead to heart failure.

To answer this question, you must be familiar with the anatomy of the heart. The right side of the heart is the pulmonary circuit while the left side is the systemic circuit. Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium of the heart via the superior and inferior vena cava. Blood from the right atrium passes through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle and then leaves the heart through the pulmonary semilunar valve. Blood is carried via the pulmonary arteries to the lungs where gas exchange occurs. After gas exchange occurs, oxygenated blood returns to the heart via pulmonary veins to enter the left atrium. From there blood passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle. Blood leaves the left side of the heart by passing through the aortic valve into the aorta. If there was a pressure increase in the pulmonary arteries, the right ventricle of the heart would be most likely affected as it is the last chamber that blood is located in before it moves toward the lungs in the pulmonary arteries.", "Final Answer": "C", "Images": []}

This question expects you to be able to consider how the kidneys are involved in regulating blood volume and blood pressure. Water that is reabsorbed in the nephrons returns to the bloodstream to increase plasma volume, which in turn increases blood pressure as the volume of blood increases. When the nephrons absorb more water to increase blood volume, the urine volume decreases. The two hormones aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone help increase the amount of water reabsorbed by nephrons, which in turn decreases urine volume. In order to reduce blood pressure, the kidneys can decrease the amount of water reabsorbed by the nephrons. The less water reabsorbed means there will be less blood volume and less blood pressure. This would ultimately increase urine volume. The question asks how the kidneys might try to reduce hypertension. This would mean that we want less water reabsorbed into the blood, which would decrease blood volume and blood pressure. To do this, urine volume would have to increase.", "Final Answer": "A", "Images": []}
{"Problem Number": "1_0_3", "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "\nLeukemia is a term that describes a wide variety of blood cell cancers. Most leukemia cases involve elevated leukocyte counts. In acute cases of leukemia, immature leukocytes proliferate quickly, which leads to many abnormal immature cells in the bone marrow. This inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce healthy new leukocytes. This form of the cancer progresses rapidly, and the cells metastasize easily as they move into the bloodstream from the bone marrow. It can be fatal within weeks or months if not treated promptly. In contrast, chronic cases of leukemia typically involve the proliferation of abnormal mature leukocytes. This form of the disease progresses more slowly, and treatment need not always be immediate.\nOnce classified as acute or chronic, leukemia can be further subdivided into lymphocytic or myelogenous. This distinction depends on which type of leukocyte is abnormal in the patient. In lymphocytic leukemia, the lymphoid cells, such as the lymphocytes, are abnormal. In the myelogenous form, the myeloid cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils, are affected.\nChemotherapy drugs are often used in the management of leukemia cases. There are numerous categories of these drugs, and they have varied mechanisms of action. In treatment, several drugs are used in combination because some of the drugs are cell-cycle specific while others are not. Alkylating agents are capable of disrupting the function of DNA. Tubulin-binding agents are designed to interfere with microtubule formation. Other drugs are designed to interfere with DNA polymerase, DNA repair mechanisms, or protein synthesis, or to act as purine analogs. Many of these drugs cannot enter into the brain when injected or ingested, so if the cancer has spread to\nthis area, special methods must be used to introduce the drugs to the brain.\nA variety of risk factors exist for leukemia. Some of these factors include exposure to radiation, certain viral infections, and inherited tendencies. What do all of these factors have in common?", "Answer Candidates": ["All involve problems with protein translation in the cells.", "All can cause an increase in the production of cellular growth factors that enhance cell proliferation.", "All cause changes to the DNA that can lead to the production of altered proteins that can influence the development of cancer.", "All cause problems with transcription in the cells."], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{C}$. Of the items listed in the question, the thing they all have in common is that they are mutagens or involve some genetic change. These mutations to the DNA can lead to the production of altered proteins that can be associated with cancer. While some cancers are associated with changes in cellular growth factors, this would not be the case for all cancers. The translation of proteins is directly from the mRNA, which is derived from the DNA in transcription. There would have to be a change in the DNA for the translation of proteins to be affected.", "Final Answer": "C", "Images": []}

{"Problem Number": "1_3_1", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "\nAccording to Professor John MacKinnon, certain places are more likely than others to house new or rediscovered species. First, scientists should look in areas that are geologically stable. Areas with regular earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are less likely to contain species that go back thousands of years because, obviously, the frequent upheavals are not conducive to steady growth or a comfortable way of life. Second, scientists are most likely to find undiscovered or rediscovered species in remote, isolated areas. Cultivated areas are inhospitable to many animals. Often, cultivation eliminates the trees or shrubs that house and protect animal life. A stable climate is a third thing to look for. Stability of climate ensures that the animals that live in the region have had no reason to leave for warmer or wetter environments.\nAlthough most of the recent discoveries and rediscoveries of animal species have taken place in tropical, humid regions, some have occurred in rarely explored mountain habitats. A fourth key thing scientists should look for, according to MacKinnon, is an area with a variety of unusual species that are specific to that area. Of course, this requirement refers back to requirement number two, isolation. An area that is very isolated or difficult to access will naturally have species that cannot be found anywhere else.\nIn 1994 American biologist Peter Zahler took his second trip to the isolated valleys of the Diamer region in northern Pakistan. He was searching for the woolly flying squirrel, a dog-sized squirrel last seen in 1924. As he describes it, he had narrowed down his search to two animals, using the criteria mammal, not too small, relatively unknown, and in need of conservation intervention. Because he did not wish to spend time in the steamy environment of the Congo basin, he eliminated the aquatic genet \nthe squirrel. Many recalled hearing tales about the strange animal, but all insisted it was extinct.\nZahler continued to set traps, listen to squirrel legends, and ask questions. He dodged avalanches, skirted valleys patrolled by armed warlords, and crossed mountains on narrow goat paths. Policemen told him that the squirrels indeed existed in caves above the valley, and that they excreted a substance, salajit, that was used as an aphrodisiac. One day, two large, machine gun-toting men entered his camp. After some small talk, one asked whether he would be willing to pay for a live squirrel. The pair claimed to be salajit collectors. Zahler agreed to pay top dollar, never envisioning that 2 hours later, he would be presented with a woolly flying squirrel in a bag. Following that surprise, Zahler located evidence of live squirrels throughout the region. The squirrel certainly obeyed all of MacKinnon's regulations. Despite frequent avalanches, the Himalayas are a geologically stable area with a harsh but stable climate and a number of rare species. Not only were the squirrels' caves remote and isolated, it was often necessary to rappel down or climb up sheer cliffs to reach them.\nEach rediscovery gives scientists a vital second chance to protect and preserve our rarest, most fragile species. With scientists and students from Pakistan, Zahler began work on a program to protect the squirrel's habitat. Only the advent of war in Afghanistan forced him to abandon the area, and he remains connected to scientists in Pakistan who are continuing the effort.\nAccording to the passage, all of these are true EXCEPT:", "Answer Candidates": ["Woolly flying squirrels excrete an unusual substance.", "The Himalayas contain a variety of unique species.", "Animals in a drought may leave for a wetter habitat.", "The woolly flying squirrel vanished for 70 years."], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $D$.

{"Problem Number": "1_3_18", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "\nAluminum is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust, but it is never found naturally as an element. Instead, it always appears naturally in its oxidized form as a hydroxide we call bauxite.\nBauxite occurs in three main forms. The forms vary in the number of molecules of water it takes for hydration and in the crystalline structure of the molecule. Gibbsite is a trihydrate form $\\left[\\operatorname{AI}(\\mathrm{OH})_{3}\\right]$. Bohmite and diaspore are monohydrates $[\\mathrm{AIO}(\\mathrm{OH})]$. Of the three, the main form that is mined is gibbsite. Bauxite may be hard or soft, and it comes in a variety of colors that range from white to red.\nBauxite is formed due to the weathering of alumina-bearing rocks. It often appears as an extensive blanket of ore and is usually mined using surface-mining techniques. By far the largest consumers of aluminum are the United States, Japan, and Germany, but except for a little in Texas and Arkansas, bauxite is nearly nonexistent there. The major producers of bauxite are Australia, which produces around 40 percent of the SECTION 4:\nCritical\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\nworld's supply, and Guinea, in West Africa. The United States gets much of its supply from Brazil and Jamaica.\nThe extraction of aluminum from bauxite requires three stages. First, the ore is mined. Then it is refined to recover alumina. Finally, the alumina is smelted to produce aluminum.\nThe mining is done via the open-cut method. Bulldozers remove the topsoil, and excavators or other types of power machinery are used to remove the underlying layer of bauxite. The bauxite may be washed to remove clay and other detritus.\nRefining is done via the Bayer refining process, named after its inventor, Karl Bayer. Ground bauxite is fed into a digester, where it is mixed with a caustic soda. The aluminum oxide reacts with the soda to form a solution of sodium aluminate and a precipitate of sodium aluminum silicate. The solution is separated from the silicate through washing and pumping, and the alumina is precipitated from the solution, where it appears as crystals of alumina hydrate. The crystals are washed again to remove any remaining solution. Then they are heated to remove water, leaving the gritty alumina.\nSmelting is done via the Hall-Heroult smelting process.

{"Problem Number": "1_3_2", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "\nAccording to Professor John MacKinnon, certain places are more likely than others to house new or rediscovered species. First, scientists should look in areas that are geologically stable. Areas with regular earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are less likely to contain species that go back thousands of years because, obviously, the frequent upheavals are not conducive to steady growth or a comfortable way of life. Second, scientists are most likely to find undiscovered or rediscovered species in remote, isolated areas. Cultivated areas are inhospitable to many animals. Often, cultivation eliminates the trees or shrubs that house and protect animal life. A stable climate is a third thing to look for. Stability of climate ensures that the animals that live in the region have had no reason to leave for warmer or wetter environments.\nAlthough most of the recent discoveries and rediscoveries of animal species have taken place in tropical, humid regions, some have occurred in rarely explored mountain habitats. A fourth key thing scientists should look for, according to MacKinnon, is an area with a variety of unusual species that are specific to that area. Of course, this requirement refers back to requirement number two, isolation. An area that is very isolated or difficult to access will naturally have species that cannot be found anywhere else.\nIn 1994 American biologist Peter Zahler took his second trip to the isolated valleys of the Diamer region in northern Pakistan. He was searching for the woolly flying squirrel, a dog-sized squirrel last seen in 1924. As he describes it, he had narrowed down his search to two animals, using the criteria mammal, not too small, relatively unknown, and in need of conservation intervention. Because he did not wish to spend time in the steamy environment of the Congo basin, he eliminated the aquatic genet \nthe squirrel. Many recalled hearing tales about the strange animal, but all insisted it was extinct.\nZahler continued to set traps, listen to squirrel legends, and ask questions. He dodged avalanches, skirted valleys patrolled by armed warlords, and crossed mountains on narrow goat paths. Policemen told him that the squirrels indeed existed in caves above the valley, and that they excreted a substance, salajit, that was used as an aphrodisiac. One day, two large, machine gun-toting men entered his camp. After some small talk, one asked whether he would be willing to pay for a live squirrel. The pair claimed to be salajit collectors. Zahler agreed to pay top dollar, never envisioning that 2 hours later, he would be presented with a woolly flying squirrel in a bag. Following that surprise, Zahler located evidence of live squirrels throughout the region. The squirrel certainly obeyed all of MacKinnon's regulations. Despite frequent avalanches, the Himalayas are a geologically stable area with a harsh but stable climate and a number of rare species. Not only were the squirrels' caves remote and isolated, it was often necessary to rappel down or climb up sheer cliffs to reach them.\nEach rediscovery gives scientists a vital second chance to protect and preserve our rarest, most fragile species. With scientists and students from Pakistan, Zahler began work on a program to protect the squirrel's habitat. Only the advent of war in Afghanistan forced him to abandon the area, and he remains connected to scientists in Pakistan who are continuing the effort.\nThe discussion of the aquatic genet shows primarily that:", "Answer Candidates": ["Some mammals are unlikely ever to be rediscovered.", "Large mammals are more easily tracked and rediscovered.", "Endangered mammals are found in many different biomes.", "Tropical diseases affect a variety of endangered species."], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{C}$. Zahler chooses not to track the aquatic genet because he prefers to look for a creature that does not live in a tropical biome.

Today, of course, we know Bowdler not for his good works, but instead for the eponym derived from his good name. To bowdlerize is to censor or amend a written work, often with a connotation of prudishness. The process for which Bowdler is known is one that continues to the present day, as texts deemed too difficult for today's high schoolers are \"dumbed-down,\" library editions of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn have the \"n-word\" blacked out, and middle-school productions of popular Broadway plays have all expletives deleted. We would be hard-pressed to say that we live in a prudish era, but some of the same impulses that drove Thomas and Harriet Bowdler still exist today.\nGiven the information in the passage, if a bowdlerized version of Shakespeare were available to parents today, which of the following outcomes would MOST likely occur?", "Answer Candidates": ["Some would ridicule it, and others would buy it.", "No one would take it or its author seriously.", "Most students would find it too difficult to read.", "It would be a dismal failure and be taken off the market."], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathbf{A}$.

{"Problem Number": "1_3_3", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "\nAccording to Professor John MacKinnon, certain places are more likely than others to house new or rediscovered species. First, scientists should look in areas that are geologically stable. Areas with regular earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are less likely to contain species that go back thousands of years because, obviously, the frequent upheavals are not conducive to steady growth or a comfortable way of life. Second, scientists are most likely to find undiscovered or rediscovered species in remote, isolated areas. Cultivated areas are inhospitable to many animals. Often, cultivation eliminates the trees or shrubs that house and protect animal life. A stable climate is a third thing to look for. Stability of climate ensures that the animals that live in the region have had no reason to leave for warmer or wetter environments.\nAlthough most of the recent discoveries and rediscoveries of animal species have taken place in tropical, humid regions, some have occurred in rarely explored mountain habitats. A fourth key thing scientists should look for, according to MacKinnon, is an area with a variety of unusual species that are specific to that area. Of course, this requirement refers back to requirement number two, isolation. An area that is very isolated or difficult to access will naturally have species that cannot be found anywhere else.\nIn 1994 American biologist Peter Zahler took his second trip to the isolated valleys of the Diamer region in northern Pakistan. He was searching for the woolly flying squirrel, a dog-sized squirrel last seen in 1924. As he describes it, he had narrowed down his search to two animals, using the criteria mammal, not too small, relatively unknown, and in need of conservation intervention. Because he did not wish to spend time in the steamy environment of the Congo basin, he eliminated the aquatic genet \nthe squirrel. Many recalled hearing tales about the strange animal, but all insisted it was extinct.\nZahler continued to set traps, listen to squirrel legends, and ask questions. He dodged avalanches, skirted valleys patrolled by armed warlords, and crossed mountains on narrow goat paths. Policemen told him that the squirrels indeed existed in caves above the valley, and that they excreted a substance, salajit, that was used as an aphrodisiac. One day, two large, machine gun-toting men entered his camp. After some small talk, one asked whether he would be willing to pay for a live squirrel. The pair claimed to be salajit collectors. Zahler agreed to pay top dollar, never envisioning that 2 hours later, he would be presented with a woolly flying squirrel in a bag. Following that surprise, Zahler located evidence of live squirrels throughout the region. The squirrel certainly obeyed all of MacKinnon's regulations. Despite frequent avalanches, the Himalayas are a geologically stable area with a harsh but stable climate and a number of rare species. Not only were the squirrels' caves remote and isolated, it was often necessary to rappel down or climb up sheer cliffs to reach them.\nEach rediscovery gives scientists a vital second chance to protect and preserve our rarest, most fragile species. With scientists and students from Pakistan, Zahler began work on a program to protect the squirrel's habitat. Only the advent of war in Afghanistan forced him to abandon the area, and he remains connected to scientists in Pakistan who are continuing the effort.\nWhich of MacKinnon's requirements does the home of the woolly flying squirrel meet?\nI. isolation\nII. geographic stability\nIII. climatic stability", "Answer Candidates": ["I only", "II only", "I and III only", "I, II, and III"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is D.

{"Problem Number": "1_3_33", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "\\section{Passage $\\mathrm{V}$}\nThe Nobel Peace Prize has often engendered controversy. The Red Cross, yes, but Henry Kissinger? Mother Teresa, perhaps, but Yasser Arafat? Surprisingly, a loud and ongoing controversy surrounds a choice that at first look seems most benign-that of the Guatemalan freedom fighter, Rigoberta Mench\u00fa Tum.\nRigoberta Mench\u00fa was born in 1959 to a poor Mayan family in Guatemala. At the time of her birth, General Yd\u00edgoras Fuentes had just seized power, following the assassination of Colonel Castillo Armas. The year she turned one, there was a failed coup by a military group, many of whom fled to the countryside and would return to lead the rebellion that would wax and wane for the next 36 years.\nGuatemala was divided into factions for that entire period, as military governments controlled the nation and guerilla groups controlled the countryside. At the same time, right-wing vigilantes led a campaign of torture and assassination, eliminating students and peasants they deemed to be allied with the guerillas.\nIn the countryside where Rigoberta lived, the battles were largely over control of farmland. Rigoberta's father was taken into custody and tortured when the army believed he had assisted in the assassination of a plantation owner. Following a rout of the guerillas by the army, the guerillas regrouped and began to take their fight to the capital, beginning a long series of assassinations of government figures.\nRigoberta, her father, and some of her siblings joined the Committee of the Peasant Union (CUC). In rapid succession, Rigoberta lost her brother, father, and mother to the army's own assassination squads. Rigoberta, though only in her early 20s, became a key figure in the resistance, traveling from village to village to educate the Mayan peasants in overcoming oppression, and leading demonstrations in Guatemala City.\nSoon Rigoberta was herself a target. She fled to Mexico and continued her life as an organizer, concentrating her focus on peasants' rights. She participated in the founding of the United Representation of the Guatemalan Opposition (RUOG). This period was the most violent of the entire Guatemalan civil war. Under the new president, General Efrain R\u00edos Montt, massacres of civilians became an everyday occurrence. SECTION 4:\nCritical\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills The controversy is all about the book. It began when anthropologist David Stoll began independent research on the same era about which Rigoberta dictated and discovered discrepancies in her recall of events. Massacres she described were not remembered by the locals; one of her brothers died by shooting rather than by fire, dates were incorrect, and so on. Stoll's discoveries were enough to roil up conservative historians and columnists, who declared Rigoberta's book the grossest propaganda and her career, therefore, unworthy of the Nobel Prize. Not surprisingly, this brought forth charges of racism, sexism, and cultural ignorance from the other side.\nThe Nobel Committee maintained a stiff upper lip throughout the political backand-forth and still insists that Rigoberta's prize had to do with her documented good works and not with her personal recorded history. Rigoberta's book is still widely taught, and her place in the history of Central American peasant revolutions seems assured.\nThe author of the passage would probably support:", "Answer Candidates": ["an inquiry that led to the removal of Rigoberta's Nobel Prize", "the removal of Rigoberta's autobiography from college curricula", "keeping Rigoberta's name in the history books as a freedom fighter", "granting the Nobel Prize exclusively to groups, not individuals\nSECTION 4:\nCritical\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $C$.

{"Problem Number": "1_3_4", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "\nAccording to Professor John MacKinnon, certain places are more likely than others to house new or rediscovered species. First, scientists should look in areas that are geologically stable. Areas with regular earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are less likely to contain species that go back thousands of years because, obviously, the frequent upheavals are not conducive to steady growth or a comfortable way of life. Second, scientists are most likely to find undiscovered or rediscovered species in remote, isolated areas. Cultivated areas are inhospitable to many animals. Often, cultivation eliminates the trees or shrubs that house and protect animal life. A stable climate is a third thing to look for. Stability of climate ensures that the animals that live in the region have had no reason to leave for warmer or wetter environments.\nAlthough most of the recent discoveries and rediscoveries of animal species have taken place in tropical, humid regions, some have occurred in rarely explored mountain habitats. A fourth key thing scientists should look for, according to MacKinnon, is an area with a variety of unusual species that are specific to that area. Of course, this requirement refers back to requirement number two, isolation. An area that is very isolated or difficult to access will naturally have species that cannot be found anywhere else.\nIn 1994 American biologist Peter Zahler took his second trip to the isolated valleys of the Diamer region in northern Pakistan. He was searching for the woolly flying squirrel, a dog-sized squirrel last seen in 1924. As he describes it, he had narrowed down his search to two animals, using the criteria mammal, not too small, relatively unknown, and in need of conservation intervention. Because he did not wish to spend time in the steamy environment of the Congo basin, he eliminated the aquatic genet \nthe squirrel. Many recalled hearing tales about the strange animal, but all insisted it was extinct.\nZahler continued to set traps, listen to squirrel legends, and ask questions. He dodged avalanches, skirted valleys patrolled by armed warlords, and crossed mountains on narrow goat paths. Policemen told him that the squirrels indeed existed in caves above the valley, and that they excreted a substance, salajit, that was used as an aphrodisiac. One day, two large, machine gun-toting men entered his camp. After some small talk, one asked whether he would be willing to pay for a live squirrel. The pair claimed to be salajit collectors. Zahler agreed to pay top dollar, never envisioning that 2 hours later, he would be presented with a woolly flying squirrel in a bag. Following that surprise, Zahler located evidence of live squirrels throughout the region. The squirrel certainly obeyed all of MacKinnon's regulations. Despite frequent avalanches, the Himalayas are a geologically stable area with a harsh but stable climate and a number of rare species. Not only were the squirrels' caves remote and isolated, it was often necessary to rappel down or climb up sheer cliffs to reach them.\nEach rediscovery gives scientists a vital second chance to protect and preserve our rarest, most fragile species. With scientists and students from Pakistan, Zahler began work on a program to protect the squirrel's habitat. Only the advent of war in Afghanistan forced him to abandon the area, and he remains connected to scientists in Pakistan who are continuing the effort.\nThe author suggests that Zahler decided to search for the woolly flying squirrel because it:", "Answer Candidates": ["lived in an area that was easily accessible", "was neither too small nor too tropical", "had been spotted recently by salajit collectors", "was a legendary creature of great renown"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $B$.

Any metanarrative, or overarching \"big story,\" must be rejected because it attempts to explain away too many individual narratives. \nhistory through that metanarrative, postmodernists would argue, does not allow us to consider the contributions of other groups to the country we live in today. So constructing a metanarrative can often be exclusionary.\nOf course, constructing a series of smaller narratives is just as exclusionary because it frames experience in a limited way. It is easy to see this occurring if you look at any university course list today. How is it possible for American History 4111, \"Imperialism and Amerindians, 1600-1840\" to coexist alongside American History 4546, \"American Military History and Policy\"? Does English 340X, \"Survey of Women's Literature,\" subsume or incorporate elements of English 342X, \"American Indian Women Writers\"? Perhaps we should pity the undergraduate student today. Lacking any overarching metanarrative to provide perspective, how can the poor student wade through the often contradictory mininarratives being thrown his or her way?\nThere is no question that the old way was wrongheaded and elitist. Survey courses that emphasized the white male perspective were removed from the curriculum in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, and for good reason. But replacing them with a smorgasbord of mininarratives risks eliminating any sense of a big picture. Can students connect the dots to define a coherent reality, or must their reality be a series of frames with no links among them?\nRevising the canon was about ridding our perspective of those racist, sexist, or classist notions that insisted on a single Truth with a capital $T$. Of course there is no overriding Truth that applies to everyone. For everyone who believes that Thomas Jefferson was a brilliant reformer, there is someone who thinks he was a two-faced slaveholder. Yet, where does it leave us if everyone we know is approaching history, science, literature, or what have you from a slightly different angle? It's bad enough when partisan politics divides us into red states and blue states. How much worse is it to imagine ourselves clad in thousands upon thousands of shades of purple?\nThe clearest sign that we are not ready to abandon our metanarratives comes in the current and ongoing clash between those who accept evolutionary theory and those who accept the Bible as the written word of God. The latter grant the Earth 6000 years of life, the former give it several million more, and never the twain shall meet. Each of these viewpoints is a metanarrative, a big story that governs people's understanding of the world. Like many metanarratives, each of these completely negates the other.\nSo on the one hand, metanarratives don't work well because they are too exclusionary. And on the other hand, mininarratives don't work well because they are too narrow. It will be fascinating to watch the canon evolve over the next few decades and to see whether this dichotomy can ever be resolved.\nA comparison of a mininarrative to a metanarrative would be MOST similar to a comparison of:", "Answer Candidates": ["a cropped photograph to a wide-angle photograph", "a globe to a world map", "a ranch-style house to a palace", "a single domestic turkey to a flock of wild turkeys"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is A.

{"Problem Number": "1_3_5", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "\nAccording to Professor John MacKinnon, certain places are more likely than others to house new or rediscovered species. First, scientists should look in areas that are geologically stable. Areas with regular earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are less likely to contain species that go back thousands of years because, obviously, the frequent upheavals are not conducive to steady growth or a comfortable way of life. Second, scientists are most likely to find undiscovered or rediscovered species in remote, isolated areas. Cultivated areas are inhospitable to many animals. Often, cultivation eliminates the trees or shrubs that house and protect animal life. A stable climate is a third thing to look for. Stability of climate ensures that the animals that live in the region have had no reason to leave for warmer or wetter environments.\nAlthough most of the recent discoveries and rediscoveries of animal species have taken place in tropical, humid regions, some have occurred in rarely explored mountain habitats. A fourth key thing scientists should look for, according to MacKinnon, is an area with a variety of unusual species that are specific to that area. Of course, this requirement refers back to requirement number two, isolation. An area that is very isolated or difficult to access will naturally have species that cannot be found anywhere else.\nIn 1994 American biologist Peter Zahler took his second trip to the isolated valleys of the Diamer region in northern Pakistan. He was searching for the woolly flying squirrel, a dog-sized squirrel last seen in 1924. As he describes it, he had narrowed down his search to two animals, using the criteria mammal, not too small, relatively unknown, and in need of conservation intervention. Because he did not wish to spend time in the steamy environment of the Congo basin, he eliminated the aquatic genet \nthe squirrel. Many recalled hearing tales about the strange animal, but all insisted it was extinct.\nZahler continued to set traps, listen to squirrel legends, and ask questions. He dodged avalanches, skirted valleys patrolled by armed warlords, and crossed mountains on narrow goat paths. Policemen told him that the squirrels indeed existed in caves above the valley, and that they excreted a substance, salajit, that was used as an aphrodisiac. One day, two large, machine gun-toting men entered his camp. After some small talk, one asked whether he would be willing to pay for a live squirrel. The pair claimed to be salajit collectors. Zahler agreed to pay top dollar, never envisioning that 2 hours later, he would be presented with a woolly flying squirrel in a bag. Following that surprise, Zahler located evidence of live squirrels throughout the region. The squirrel certainly obeyed all of MacKinnon's regulations. Despite frequent avalanches, the Himalayas are a geologically stable area with a harsh but stable climate and a number of rare species. Not only were the squirrels' caves remote and isolated, it was often necessary to rappel down or climb up sheer cliffs to reach them.\nEach rediscovery gives scientists a vital second chance to protect and preserve our rarest, most fragile species. With scientists and students from Pakistan, Zahler began work on a program to protect the squirrel's habitat. Only the advent of war in Afghanistan forced him to abandon the area, and he remains connected to scientists in Pakistan who are continuing the effort.\nAccording to the passage, which of these locations would be likely to house a new species?\nI. the jungles of Borneo\nII. the mountains of western Iran\nIII. the edges of the eastern Sahara", "Answer Candidates": ["I only", "II only", "I and II only", "II and III only"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is A.

In the early '40s, Kerouac attended Columbia University on a football scholarship, but a leg injury ended his football career and forced him to drop out of school. His brief sojourn with the Merchant Marine and the Navy ended badly, and Kerouac limped back to New York to rejoin friends at Columbia, where he met student Allen Ginsberg and the older William S. Burroughs. Most of Kerouac's friends had come of age during World War II, just as Ernest Hemingway and his friends had done during World War I. Just as Hemingway's generation was \"Lost,\" the new generation was \"Beat.\" They found SECTION 4:\nCritical\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\nit impossible to find a place in the new, postwar economy.

Failure of the kidneys or respiratory system can have drastic consequences on the body's ability to regulate blood $\\mathrm{pH}$. In order to regulate $\\mathrm{pH}$ in the blood, a buffering system is used, which is shown. This reaction is completely reversible and is driven in either direction depending on the concentration of the reactants. A change to one item in this reaction will in turn affect the concentration of all of the other items. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase:\nGenerally, there are not many problems with the body's ability to have plenty of $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ ions in reserve. However, if $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ion levels should become too low, the kidneys can generate more. In the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of the nephrons, carbonic anhydrase converts $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which dissociates into $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Kidney failure or damage to the carbonic anhydrase enzyme can cause major problems in the ability to regulate blood $\\mathrm{pH}$.\nWhen the kidneys fail, their functions must be mimicked or death will occur. Dialysis is used as a means to perform some of the normal functions of the kidneys, which includes the maintenance of acid-base balance.

To answer this question, you need to analyze the data provided. Looking at the number of embryos surviving, you should notice that all three groups treated with any dosage of L-NAME had decreased survival as compared to the control group. The passage explains that L-NAME is a NOS inhibitor. If the enzyme needed to convert L-arginine to NO does not work, then NO levels will be decreased. The data suggest that a decreased level of $\\mathrm{NO}$ provided by the L-NAME treatment is detrimental. Further, the higher the dose of L-NAME, the more inhibition of NOS and the less NO provided, led to a dose dependent decrease in survival that eliminates choice $\\mathrm{C}$ as an option. The passage also explains that SNP is a NO donor, which increases NO levels. According to the data provided for the SNP groups, a small increase in NO (seen in group 2) seems to increase embryo survival. However, as the SNP dose becomes larger (and the higher the level of NO provided), this will lead to decreased survival. The highest rates of survival were seen in the $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SNP group, and survival decreased with increased dosage of SNP. This would eliminate choice B since increasing levels of NOS would increase NO levels similar to SNP treatment. The data show that SNP treatment (which increases NO levels) is most detrimental to embryo survival. Choice D directly contradicts this. The best conclusion is that $\\mathrm{NO}$ is necessary for development, since the data showed that the NO inhibition leads to decreased survival. However, only a certain amount of NO is needed as high levels also lead to decreased rates of embryo survival.", "Final Answer": "A", "Images": ["2_0_20_0.jpg"]}

The uptake of water from the roots, through the stem, and into the tissue of the plant occurs via capillary actionthe motion of fluid through extremely small vessels or tubes. Capillary action involves the interaction of the following two types of forces: adhesive forces that allow the water's molecules to adhere or stick to the plant tissues and cohesive forces that provide an attraction between water molecules. Upward movement of the water through the capillary vessels occurs when the adhesive forces are greater than the cohesive forces. The height, $h$, that the water will ascend up the plant depends upon the surface tension, $T$, of the water according to the equation:\n$$\nh=\\frac{2 T}{\\rho g r}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of water $\\left(=1000 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\right), g$ is the acceleration due to gravity $\\left(=9.8 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}\\right)$, and $r$ is the radius of the plant stem.\nTo explore capillary action, the following experiment was conducted to determine the effects of sugar in water transported up the stem of identical carnation flowers.

{"Problem Number": "2_0_4", "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_2", "Problem Statement": "\nMaintenance of proper $\\mathrm{pH}$ throughout the body is critical to homeostasis and is carried out through the collective efforts of multiple systems in the body. Failure of the kidneys or respiratory system can have drastic consequences on the body's ability to regulate blood $\\mathrm{pH}$. In order to regulate $\\mathrm{pH}$ in the blood, a buffering system is used, which is shown. This reaction is completely reversible and is driven in either direction depending on the concentration of the reactants. A change to one item in this reaction will in turn affect the concentration of all of the other items. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase:\nGenerally, there are not many problems with the body's ability to have plenty of $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ ions in reserve. However, if $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ion levels should become too low, the kidneys can generate more. In the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of the nephrons, carbonic anhydrase converts $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which dissociates into $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Kidney failure or damage to the carbonic anhydrase enzyme can cause major problems in the ability to regulate blood $\\mathrm{pH}$.\nWhen the kidneys fail, their functions must be mimicked or death will occur. Dialysis is used as a means to perform some of the normal functions of the kidneys, which includes the maintenance of acid-base balance. During dialysis, the patient's blood is exposed to dialysis fluid. The dialysis fluid has been prepared such that it will perform a variety of functions that include balancing blood $\\mathrm{pH}$, removing wastes from the blood, and removing excess fluids. While dialysis treatment is not nearly as efficient as natural kidney function, it can be used for extended periods of time in many patients with satisfactory results.\nMany dialysis patients do not produce any urine, so dialysis must be used to manage their fluid levels.

Another way to say this is that the blood must be hypotonic (contain less solutes and more water) than the dialysis fluid (choice C).

{"Problem Number": "2_3_1", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_2", "Problem Statement": "\nSea beans. Ballast waifs. These adorable nicknames do not hint at the destructive nature of invasive plants. Sea beans are those plants whose seeds, buoyed by a pocket of air, float on the tide from one island to another, or even across vast stretches of ocean. Ballast waifs are less natural in origin; they are seeds that arrive on one shore from another in the soil placed in a ship's hold as ballast.\nOne remarkably lovely and dreadfully damaging ballast waif is Lythrum salicaria, the bright purple, spiky flower known commonly as purple loosestrife. Purple loosestrife is not a newcomer to U.S. shores; it arrived from Eurasia, almost certainly via ship, some 200 years ago. It was widely used for medicinal and ornamental purposes throughout the 19th century. Its lovely purple blooms may still be seen in gardens throughout the country, where people love it for its long growing season.\nFor all its beauty, purple loosestrife is a menace. The same long growing season that makes it so beloved by gardeners makes it a seed-making machine. A mature plant may produce 2 or 3 million seeds a year.\nThat is not enough for Lythrum salicaria, however. It also propagates underground, sending out shoots and stems in all directions. It is also able to cross-pollinate with other species of Lythrum.\nScientists took little notice of purple loosestrife until sometime in the 1930s, when a particular strain began colonizing along the St. Lawrence River, an area rife with the sort of wetlands purple loosestrife likes best. Purple loosestrife does not just propagate wildly; it also adapts easily to changes in environment. As it starts up in a new area, it quickly outcompetes native grasses, sedges, and other flowering plants, forming dense MCAT\nstands of purple loosestrife where once heterogeneous wetland meadows existed. This not only eradicates the native plants, but it also removes food sources for migratory birds and other animals.\nIn recent years, purple loosestrife has had a devastating impact on native cattails and wild rice. It has invaded and destroyed spawning areas for fish. In rural areas, it is beginning to move away from wetlands and adapt to drier areas, encroaching on agricultural lands. In urban areas, it is blocking pipes and drainage canals. It has moved steadily westward and is now found in all states but Florida.\nAttempts to control purple loosestrife have been only partially successful. It has proved resistant to many herbicides, and it is impervious to burning, as its rootstock lies beneath the surface and can reproduce from there. It can be mowed down and plowed under, and then replaced with a less invasive plant. This is very labor-intensive in marshy areas that are substantially overgrown, but it may be the only way of eliminating the pest. Plowing it under requires unusually large discs on the plow because it is important to chop up the rootstock. Gardeners who have planted purple loosestrife are encouraged to dig it up and replace it with other, less damaging plants.\nThe best plan may be to seek a natural enemy of purple loosestrife, a weevil or insect that will destroy the plant. However, finding such an enemy that will target only purple loosestrife while leaving other, preferred plants intact is a daunting task. More important than that, introducing yet another foreign species to American swampland may lead to problems that make our purple loosestrife infestation look mild.\nAccording to the passage, all of these are true EXCEPT:", "Answer Candidates": ["Purple loosestrife propagates through an underground system.", "Purple loosestrife has even affected the survival of fish.", "Purple loosestrife is best eradicated through controlled burning.", "Purple loosestrife is often used in American gardens."], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is C.

{"Problem Number": "2_3_2", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_2", "Problem Statement": "\nSea beans. Ballast waifs. These adorable nicknames do not hint at the destructive nature of invasive plants. Sea beans are those plants whose seeds, buoyed by a pocket of air, float on the tide from one island to another, or even across vast stretches of ocean. Ballast waifs are less natural in origin; they are seeds that arrive on one shore from another in the soil placed in a ship's hold as ballast.\nOne remarkably lovely and dreadfully damaging ballast waif is Lythrum salicaria, the bright purple, spiky flower known commonly as purple loosestrife. Purple loosestrife is not a newcomer to U.S. shores; it arrived from Eurasia, almost certainly via ship, some 200 years ago. It was widely used for medicinal and ornamental purposes throughout the 19th century. Its lovely purple blooms may still be seen in gardens throughout the country, where people love it for its long growing season.\nFor all its beauty, purple loosestrife is a menace. The same long growing season that makes it so beloved by gardeners makes it a seed-making machine. A mature plant may produce 2 or 3 million seeds a year.\nThat is not enough for Lythrum salicaria, however. It also propagates underground, sending out shoots and stems in all directions. It is also able to cross-pollinate with other species of Lythrum.\nScientists took little notice of purple loosestrife until sometime in the 1930s, when a particular strain began colonizing along the St. Lawrence River, an area rife with the sort of wetlands purple loosestrife likes best. Purple loosestrife does not just propagate wildly; it also adapts easily to changes in environment. As it starts up in a new area, it quickly outcompetes native grasses, sedges, and other flowering plants, forming dense MCAT\nstands of purple loosestrife where once heterogeneous wetland meadows existed. This not only eradicates the native plants, but it also removes food sources for migratory birds and other animals.\nIn recent years, purple loosestrife has had a devastating impact on native cattails and wild rice. It has invaded and destroyed spawning areas for fish. In rural areas, it is beginning to move away from wetlands and adapt to drier areas, encroaching on agricultural lands. In urban areas, it is blocking pipes and drainage canals. It has moved steadily westward and is now found in all states but Florida.\nAttempts to control purple loosestrife have been only partially successful. It has proved resistant to many herbicides, and it is impervious to burning, as its rootstock lies beneath the surface and can reproduce from there. It can be mowed down and plowed under, and then replaced with a less invasive plant. This is very labor-intensive in marshy areas that are substantially overgrown, but it may be the only way of eliminating the pest. Plowing it under requires unusually large discs on the plow because it is important to chop up the rootstock. Gardeners who have planted purple loosestrife are encouraged to dig it up and replace it with other, less damaging plants.\nThe best plan may be to seek a natural enemy of purple loosestrife, a weevil or insect that will destroy the plant. However, finding such an enemy that will target only purple loosestrife while leaving other, preferred plants intact is a daunting task. More important than that, introducing yet another foreign species to American swampland may lead to problems that make our purple loosestrife infestation look mild.\nThe mention of the St. Lawrence River shows primarily that:", "Answer Candidates": ["Sea beans prefer to travel on freshwater conveyances.", "Purple loosestrife does well in marshy areas along rivers.", "Most sea beans survive best in northern regions.", "Purple loosestrife can be replaced by less damaging plants."], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{B}$.

{"Problem Number": "2_3_26", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_2", "Problem Statement": "\\section{Passage $\\mathrm{V}$}\nIn linguistics, metathesis refers to the reversal of phonemes in a word. This can come about by accident, as in the common mispronunciation \"aks\" for ask or the common (and correct) pronunciation of iron as \"i-orn.\" It may come about on purpose, as in various language games.\nAccidental metathesis may be a process that takes place in the evolution of languages. Over time, for example, the Latin words miraculum, periculum, and parabola evolved into the Spanish words milagro, peligro, and palabra. Linguists posit that such SECTION 4:\nCritical\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\nchanges usually occur when two consonants are of the same type, with similar mouth formations needed to create each one.\nThe Reverend Archibald Spooner, an Oxford dean, was known for his unintentional transpositions and gave his name to the particular metathesis he represented: Spoonerisms. Most famous Spoonerisms once attributed to Spooner are now believed to be apocryphal, but they are nevertheless amusing; for example, his supposed advice to a substandard student: \"You have deliberately tasted two worms and will leave Oxford by the next town drain.\" Spoonerisms are funny when the metathesis involved changes one word into another, and they seem to lend themselves particularly well to off-color jokes.\nEveryone is familiar with Pig Latin, in which initial consonant sounds are moved to the end of a word and followed with the syllable \"ay.\" This is not pure metathesis, but it begins with the kind of metathesis known as backslang, in which syllables or letters in a word are reversed to produce a private code. Pig Latin may have begun as a language spoken in prisoner-of-war camps; it was certainly used in such camps during World War II and in Vietnam.\nIn Pig Latin, the phrase \"Over the river and through the woods\" becomes \"Overay uhthay iverray anday oughthray uhthay oodsway.\" In other variations of Pig Latin, it might instead be \"Overway uhthay iverray andway oughthray uhthay oodsway.\" There are computer programs that translate from English to Pig Latin and back again, and there is even a version of the Bible written entirely in Pig Latin. For the most part, however, outside of prisoner-of-war camps, Pig Latin is a funny code used by children.\nFrench children and teenagers use a similar code. Called verlan (a reversal of l'envers, or \"reversal\"), it is trickier than Pig Latin because it relies much more on phonetics than on spelling. In verlan, the word caf\u00e9 becomes f\u00e9ca, but the word tomber (\"to fall\") becomes b\u00e9ton. Verlan becomes even more complex in words that end in silent $e$ or which have only one syllable.

{"Problem Number": "2_3_3", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_2", "Problem Statement": "\nSea beans. Ballast waifs. These adorable nicknames do not hint at the destructive nature of invasive plants. Sea beans are those plants whose seeds, buoyed by a pocket of air, float on the tide from one island to another, or even across vast stretches of ocean. Ballast waifs are less natural in origin; they are seeds that arrive on one shore from another in the soil placed in a ship's hold as ballast.\nOne remarkably lovely and dreadfully damaging ballast waif is Lythrum salicaria, the bright purple, spiky flower known commonly as purple loosestrife. Purple loosestrife is not a newcomer to U.S. shores; it arrived from Eurasia, almost certainly via ship, some 200 years ago. It was widely used for medicinal and ornamental purposes throughout the 19th century. Its lovely purple blooms may still be seen in gardens throughout the country, where people love it for its long growing season.\nFor all its beauty, purple loosestrife is a menace. The same long growing season that makes it so beloved by gardeners makes it a seed-making machine. A mature plant may produce 2 or 3 million seeds a year.\nThat is not enough for Lythrum salicaria, however. It also propagates underground, sending out shoots and stems in all directions. It is also able to cross-pollinate with other species of Lythrum.\nScientists took little notice of purple loosestrife until sometime in the 1930s, when a particular strain began colonizing along the St. Lawrence River, an area rife with the sort of wetlands purple loosestrife likes best. Purple loosestrife does not just propagate wildly; it also adapts easily to changes in environment. As it starts up in a new area, it quickly outcompetes native grasses, sedges, and other flowering plants, forming dense MCAT\nstands of purple loosestrife where once heterogeneous wetland meadows existed. This not only eradicates the native plants, but it also removes food sources for migratory birds and other animals.\nIn recent years, purple loosestrife has had a devastating impact on native cattails and wild rice. It has invaded and destroyed spawning areas for fish. In rural areas, it is beginning to move away from wetlands and adapt to drier areas, encroaching on agricultural lands. In urban areas, it is blocking pipes and drainage canals. It has moved steadily westward and is now found in all states but Florida.\nAttempts to control purple loosestrife have been only partially successful. It has proved resistant to many herbicides, and it is impervious to burning, as its rootstock lies beneath the surface and can reproduce from there. It can be mowed down and plowed under, and then replaced with a less invasive plant. This is very labor-intensive in marshy areas that are substantially overgrown, but it may be the only way of eliminating the pest. Plowing it under requires unusually large discs on the plow because it is important to chop up the rootstock. Gardeners who have planted purple loosestrife are encouraged to dig it up and replace it with other, less damaging plants.\nThe best plan may be to seek a natural enemy of purple loosestrife, a weevil or insect that will destroy the plant. However, finding such an enemy that will target only purple loosestrife while leaving other, preferred plants intact is a daunting task. More important than that, introducing yet another foreign species to American swampland may lead to problems that make our purple loosestrife infestation look mild.\nWhich fact or facts about purple loosestrife add to its power of endurance?\nI. ability to cross-pollinate\nII. easy adaptability\nIII. spiky stems and flowers", "Answer Candidates": ["I only", "II only", "I and II only", "I, II, and III"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is C.

These adorable nicknames do not hint at the destructive nature of invasive plants. Sea beans are those plants whose seeds, buoyed by a pocket of air, float on the tide from one island to another, or even across vast stretches of ocean. Ballast waifs are less natural in origin; they are seeds that arrive on one shore from another in the soil placed in a ship's hold as ballast.\nOne remarkably lovely and dreadfully damaging ballast waif is Lythrum salicaria, the bright purple, spiky flower known commonly as purple loosestrife. Purple loosestrife is not a newcomer to U.S. shores; it arrived from Eurasia, almost certainly via ship, some 200 years ago. It was widely used for medicinal and ornamental purposes throughout the 19th century. Its lovely purple blooms may still be seen in gardens throughout the country, where people love it for its long growing season.\nFor all its beauty, purple loosestrife is a menace. The same long growing season that makes it so beloved by gardeners makes it a seed-making machine. A mature plant may produce 2 or 3 million seeds a year.\nThat is not enough for Lythrum salicaria, however. It also propagates underground, sending out shoots and stems in all directions. It is also able to cross-pollinate with other species of Lythrum.\nScientists took little notice of purple loosestrife until sometime in the 1930s, when a particular strain began colonizing along the St. Lawrence River, an area rife with the sort of wetlands purple loosestrife likes best. Purple loosestrife does not just propagate wildly; it also adapts easily to changes in environment. As it starts up in a new area, it quickly outcompetes native grasses, sedges, and other flowering plants, forming dense MCAT\nstands of purple loosestrife where once heterogeneous wetland meadows existed. This not only eradicates the native plants, but it also removes food sources for migratory birds and other animals.\nIn recent years, purple loosestrife has had a devastating impact on native cattails and wild rice. It has invaded and destroyed spawning areas for fish. In rural areas, it is beginning to move away from wetlands and adapt to drier areas, encroaching on agricultural lands. In urban areas, it is blocking pipes and drainage canals. It has moved steadily westward and is now found in all states but Florida.\nAttempts to control purple loosestrife have been only partially successful. It has proved resistant to many herbicides, and it is impervious to burning, as its rootstock lies beneath the surface and can reproduce from there. It can be mowed down and plowed under, and then replaced with a less invasive plant. This is very labor-intensive in marshy areas that are substantially overgrown, but it may be the only way of eliminating the pest. Plowing it under requires unusually large discs on the plow because it is important to chop up the rootstock. Gardeners who have planted purple loosestrife are encouraged to dig it up and replace it with other, less damaging plants.\nThe best plan may be to seek a natural enemy of purple loosestrife, a weevil or insect that will destroy the plant. However, finding such an enemy that will target only purple loosestrife while leaving other, preferred plants intact is a daunting task. More important than that, introducing yet another foreign species to American swampland may lead to problems that make our purple loosestrife infestation look mild.\nThe author suggests that people enjoy growing purple loosestrife because:", "Answer Candidates": ["It keeps out other weeds.", "It makes millions of seeds.", "It has a long growing season.", "It reduces weevils and insects."], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is C.

The horseshoe crab is the relative youngster of the group, belonging to the Jurassic period and having shown little structural changes in its 200-million-year lifespan. The lampshell, a member of the phylum Brachiopoda, is part of an even older lineage, resembling ancestors that lived nearly 400 million years ago.\nThe oldest members of the living fossil family are the lungfish and the coelacanth, both species that are remarkably similar to their forebears that roamed the Earth almost 425 million years ago. The lungfish, of which there are six surviving species, has the same basic structure and fleshy lobe fins of its progenitor, the sarcopterygian. Of course, the lungfish has long interested biologists not just because of its connections to the distant past but because of the bridge it represents between aquatic species and land dwellers. In fact, the African and South American species of lungfish live part of their lives entirely on land, burrowing into mud and respiring through a tiny breathing hole in their earthy homes. Although the lungfish has remained evolutionarily stable for close to 250 million years, prior to that the species did experience rapid and dynamic evolutionary change. However, by the end of the Permian period, the changes ground to a halt, and the lungfish has persevered happily ever since.\nThe singular story of the coelacanth stretches all the way from the Silurian period, some 425 million years ago, to the modern day. The coelacanths were well-known from the fossil record and dating technologies placed them in a time when plants were just beginning to encroach on the land. However, biologists thought the species went extinct long before the dinosaurs did. Imagine the surprise when in 1938 a South American trawler captured a strange-looking fish, some five feet in length and a pale blue and silver in color. By an astounding coincidence, the captain of the boat had a relationship with the curator of the East London Museum and had made a habit of sending any interesting finds along to her. Upon seeing this strange specimen, the curator contacted a leading ichthyologist, who, after examining the creature, said he \"would not have been more surprised if I had seen a dinosaur walking down the street.\" But despite all protestations of common sense and amid allegations of forgery and fakery, upon further study, the creature was indubitably a coelacanth.

A mature plant may produce 2 or 3 million seeds a year.\nThat is not enough for Lythrum salicaria, however. It also propagates underground, sending out shoots and stems in all directions. It is also able to cross-pollinate with other species of Lythrum.\nScientists took little notice of purple loosestrife until sometime in the 1930s, when a particular strain began colonizing along the St. Lawrence River, an area rife with the sort of wetlands purple loosestrife likes best. Purple loosestrife does not just propagate wildly; it also adapts easily to changes in environment. As it starts up in a new area, it quickly outcompetes native grasses, sedges, and other flowering plants, forming dense MCAT\nstands of purple loosestrife where once heterogeneous wetland meadows existed. This not only eradicates the native plants, but it also removes food sources for migratory birds and other animals.\nIn recent years, purple loosestrife has had a devastating impact on native cattails and wild rice. It has invaded and destroyed spawning areas for fish. In rural areas, it is beginning to move away from wetlands and adapt to drier areas, encroaching on agricultural lands. In urban areas, it is blocking pipes and drainage canals. It has moved steadily westward and is now found in all states but Florida.\nAttempts to control purple loosestrife have been only partially successful. It has proved resistant to many herbicides, and it is impervious to burning, as its rootstock lies beneath the surface and can reproduce from there. It can be mowed down and plowed under, and then replaced with a less invasive plant. This is very labor-intensive in marshy areas that are substantially overgrown, but it may be the only way of eliminating the pest. Plowing it under requires unusually large discs on the plow because it is important to chop up the rootstock. Gardeners who have planted purple loosestrife are encouraged to dig it up and replace it with other, less damaging plants.\nThe best plan may be to seek a natural enemy of purple loosestrife, a weevil or insect that will destroy the plant. However, finding such an enemy that will target only purple loosestrife while leaving other, preferred plants intact is a daunting task. More important than that, introducing yet another foreign species to American swampland may lead to problems that make our purple loosestrife infestation look mild.\nAccording to the passage, where would purple loosestrife easily thrive?\nI. in the subtropical swamps of central Florida\nII. in the wetland meadows of eastern Michigan\nIII. along the inland waterways of North Carolina", "Answer Candidates": ["I only", "II only", "I and II only", "II and III only"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is D.

Of course, it's not that voting is an overly troublesome or burdensome activity; commonsense explanations of voting behavior are often borne out through empirical study. People vote in order to express their preferences for a particular candidate or platform, to demonstrate their civic pride, or to involve themselves in the political process. The puzzle lies instead in the actual act of voting, which in many ways conforms to what social scientists term the \"free-rider problem.\" Any social good that spreads both costs and benefits amongst a number of citizens encourages the citizens to attempt to reap the benefits without incurring the costs. Given the almost infinitesimal chance that any one individual's vote would actually affect the outcome of an election and given that the supporters of the winning candidate all share equally in the benefit of that candidate's election, the costs of voting, no matter how minor they may be, appear to make voting an irrational act. Better to stay home on election day and let the others do the heavy lifting, the thinking goes.\nBut the fact is people do get up on election day and vote. Various theories have been postulated to explain this seemingly irrational behavior, but there are three factors that political scientists return to again and again: resources, mobilization, and instrumental motivation.\nResources refer to both material possessions such as money and transportation, and immaterial things such as time and political knowledge. Mobilization refers to the pressures the media, political parties, and other groups can exert on an individual in order to make him or her feel compelled to vote. Instrumental motivation is the extent to which a person believes his or her vote will actually affect the outcome of the election.\nOf these three critical factors, resources has received the most scholarly attention. According to a classic view of voting behavior, people vote because they have the time and the money to do so. Some political scientists have even calculated what they call a baseline model of political participation. This model attempts to predict political participation based on an individual's level of education, income, and several other occupational variables. Certain individual traits may affect the final decision, but the theory holds that the level of resources is a better predictor of political behavior than any other factor.\nUnfortunately, this model, while achieving some success when applied to actual political behavior, suffers from a serious flaw. The model becomes useless when the voting behaviors of citizens from other countries are compared. The differences in voter turnout across educational levels and income are smaller than the differences found in turnout across various countries.

Oncogenes develop when a proto-oncogene activates. In order for a virus to carry an oncogene into its host, that virus must be derived from a virus that picked up the gene from a former host cell. Spontaneous mutation alone could not account for a virus acquiring an entire proto-oncogene, which eliminates choice A. Viruses do not conjugate, so choice B can be eliminated as well. Transformation occurs when a cell incorporates foreign DNA from its environment into its own genome. This occurs with bacteria but not viruses, meaning that choice $\\mathrm{C}$ can also be eliminated. This leaves transduction as the only choice. When a virus excises from the host chromosome, it can take with it genes from the host's chromosome. A virus could feasibly acquire an activated oncogene when excising from its host, and this gene could be transferred to a new host.", "Final Answer": "D", "Images": ["3_0_31_0.jpg"]}

This question is essentially asking how a cancerous cell could have its cell division halted. Because cancer is characterized by uncontrolled mitosis, the best way to halt the cancer would be to halt mitosis.

Introducing additional growth factors to the cell would only increase the rate of cell division, which is the opposite of what this question is asking.

{"Problem Number": "3_3_1", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_3", "Problem Statement": "\nRecent research indicates that our experience of happiness can be self-regulated, regardless of external circumstances. We can actively choose to be happy. It was previously thought that levels of happiness were genetically determined; people were born with a genetic predisposition to cheerfulness or pessimism. However, studies now suggest that such predispositions, although present, are not fixed. Instead, emotion, and indeed the structure of the brain, can be modified through certain practices.\nThese findings are indebted to the work of psychologist Gordon Watson, who in 1930 conducted a study entitled \"Happiness Among Adult Students of Education.\" Because happiness was considered a highly desired yet elusive and mysterious emotion, Watson's serious endeavor was startling. By the 1970s, the psychological community was researching happiness on a larger scale. Today, it is estimated that over 2000 researchers in 42 countries are actively involved in happiness research.\nIn that crowded field, the work of a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Richard Davidson, stands out. Davidson observed patterns of brain activity as they related to a subject's mental and emotional states, using brain science's new technologies, including quantitative electrophysiology, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. He discovered what Western science once believed to be impossible: that the brain is not a static organ-it is able to change and develop over time. This capacity is known as neuroplasticity, and it has had a profound effect on the study of happiness.\nDavidson's studies found that the functions of the brain's cerebral cortex are not limited to determining intelligence, interpreting sensory impulses, and controlling motor function as once believed. In fact, this area also determines personality, including emotional predispositions. Levels of activity on the right and left sides of the cerebral cortex relate to feelings of happiness and sadness. Specifically, higher levels of activity at the left frontal area of the cerebral cortex coincide with feelings of happiness, For example, meditation has been shown to generate left-brain activity, and studies show that it produces positive emotions. Davidson studied the link between meditation and happiness through a project involving Tibetan Buddhist monks. His research brings together Eastern and Western traditions, and it links together objective reality with internal states of consciousness once thought to be subjective. The connection is made through observable electrical activity in the central nervous system. When the monks in the study meditated, their brain activity was recorded. Increases in left cerebral cortex activity indicate that the practice of meditation can, over time, change the structure of the brain, increasing the size and activity level of the left cerebral cortex.\nAnother practice that has been shown to stimulate left cerebral cortex activity and enhance feelings of happiness is the altering of conscious thoughts. More specifically, when a subject repeats positive affirmations_thinking optimistic thoughts-activity in the left cerebral cortex increases. As with the practice of meditation, the repetition of positive affirmations can change the structure of the brain over time, creating feelings of happiness and well-being. These findings show that the mind-body connection cannot be denied.\nIn the context of the passage, the word elusive means:", "Answer Candidates": ["prevaricating", "deceitful", "frank", "evasive"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{D}$.

During his lifetime, however, he was the most celebrated poet in the country. A closer look at the history of American poetry reveals that, despite his eminence, Longfellow wrote in a mold of both form and content that was already being challenged during his lifetime. But why, a century later, do the artistic works of many of his contemporaries continue to be enjoyed and studied while Longfellow languishes in the tomb of cultural artifacts?\nOne answer lies in the radical shift that began to take place in poetry in the mid19th century. Longfellow's themes and steadfast rhymes (and those of John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell) gave way gradually to confessional verse, whose subjects were more personal and rhymes were looser and less conventional. But to understand this shift, one must first understand the nature of Longfellow's work and his standing in the American literary scene of his time.\nLongfellow took as his subject his country's historical imagination, writing on an epic scale about Paul Revere, the Indian Hiawatha, and the pilgrim Miles Standish. He bestowed a mythic dimension on these figures, giving American readers iconic images that helped form a collective consciousness in the new country (indeed, Longfellow was a part of the first generation to be born in the United States). But Longfellow's content went beyond nationalistic pride-it was highly accessible and incredibly popular. Its accessibility is explained by his obvious themes that could be easily understood and embraced by the public. Longfellow did not challenge his readers, but appealed to their desire for stories that expounded an optimistic, sentimental, and moralistic worldview. Those themes were explored in rhyme that allowed readers to commit the poems to memory, much like songs. In 1857, The Song of Hiawatha, arguably his bestknown poem, sold 50,000 copies, an astounding number at the time. The next year, The Courtship of Miles Standish sold 25,000 copies in two months and in London sold 10,000 copies in one day. His success allowed him to give up a professorship at Harvard and focus full time on his writing.\nWalt Whitman, Longfellow's contemporary, wrote poetry similar to that of Longfellow-romantic and sentimental, with conventional rhyme and meter. But in the 1850s, indeed two years before The Song of Hiawatha, he wrote and published Leaves of Grass; a more radical departure from his previous work could not have been imagined. The 12 unnamed poems comprising Leaves of Grass are written in free verse-that is, without conventional rhyme and meter. Yet, like Longfellow, he was determined to explore the subject of America and his love for his country.\nWhitman looked to the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson for inspiration. Emerson wrote \"America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography dazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for metres.\" Indeed, Whitman paraphrased Emerson in his preface. Whitman's groundbreaking free verse changed the trajectory of American poetry. The next generation of poets, including Ezra Pound, Hart Crane, Sherwood Anderson, and William Carlos Williams, celebrated their debt to Whitman. Decades later, the influence of Whitman's work on Allen Ginsberg and Langston Hughes, among many others, continues his legacy.\nOne of America's most famous Modern poets, Ezra Pound, said of Walt Whitman, \"As for Whitman, I read him (in many parts) with acute pain, but when I write of certain things I find myself using his rhythms.\" How does this quote affect the author's contention that Pound and his generation of poets celebrated their debt to Whitman?", "Answer Candidates": ["It repudiates it.", "It endorses it.", "It denies the contention by showing Pound's distaste for Whitman's work.", "It calls into question the author's use of the word celebrate."], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{D}$.

{"Problem Number": "3_3_18", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_3", "Problem Statement": "\nIn literature, the period typically referred to as the 20th century actually begins in the previous century. To many, Queen Victoria's Jubilee in 1887 effectively marked the end of a literary epoch. The prevailing aesthetic sensibility, art for art's sake, was dying a slow death, as the gulf between artists and writers and the rest of the public widened, resulting in the widespread idea of the artist as one alienated from the rest of society. This viewpoint was spurred on by the bohemian culture movement, which arose in France and quickly spread. At its core, the bohemian movement scoffed at the limits placed on the individual by polite society and sought to isolate the artist from society as one who both rejects and is rejected by society.\nAcross the English Channel, developments in England further accentuated the separation of the artist from society at large. The Education Act of 1870 made elementary education mandatory, creating a massive class of literate, though still mostly uneducated, consumers. In response to this new market, new forms of entertainment were created, including the cheap and sensational \"yellow press,\" which focused on scandal, crime, and other base aspects of human nature. Furthermore, publishers \naudiences, the degree and the speed at which these audiences became fragmented occurred at an unprecedented rate in the early 20th century.\nThe emergence and mass production of such so-called popular literature provided more fodder for the artistic elite's war on the crude and unsophisticated philistines in the public square. Perhaps this divide and the artist's growing awareness of difference led to a prevalence of pessimism and stoicism in the literature of the late Victorian period. Hardy, Housman, and Stevenson all expressed at least some form of overweening negativity or passivity in their prose and poetry.\nThe end of Victoria's reign brought Edward VII to the throne, and Edwardian England seemed to articulate all those qualities the artistic elite had grown weary of. Edward VII has been described as self-indulgent, and his 10 -year regime was a boon to those who had the means to enjoy a life of idle pleasures.

{"Problem Number": "3_3_2", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_3", "Problem Statement": "\nRecent research indicates that our experience of happiness can be self-regulated, regardless of external circumstances. We can actively choose to be happy. It was previously thought that levels of happiness were genetically determined; people were born with a genetic predisposition to cheerfulness or pessimism. However, studies now suggest that such predispositions, although present, are not fixed. Instead, emotion, and indeed the structure of the brain, can be modified through certain practices.\nThese findings are indebted to the work of psychologist Gordon Watson, who in 1930 conducted a study entitled \"Happiness Among Adult Students of Education.\" Because happiness was considered a highly desired yet elusive and mysterious emotion, Watson's serious endeavor was startling. By the 1970s, the psychological community was researching happiness on a larger scale. Today, it is estimated that over 2000 researchers in 42 countries are actively involved in happiness research.\nIn that crowded field, the work of a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Richard Davidson, stands out. Davidson observed patterns of brain activity as they related to a subject's mental and emotional states, using brain science's new technologies, including quantitative electrophysiology, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. He discovered what Western science once believed to be impossible: that the brain is not a static organ-it is able to change and develop over time. This capacity is known as neuroplasticity, and it has had a profound effect on the study of happiness.\nDavidson's studies found that the functions of the brain's cerebral cortex are not limited to determining intelligence, interpreting sensory impulses, and controlling motor function as once believed. In fact, this area also determines personality, including emotional predispositions. Levels of activity on the right and left sides of the cerebral cortex relate to feelings of happiness and sadness. Specifically, higher levels of activity at the left frontal area of the cerebral cortex coincide with feelings of happiness, For example, meditation has been shown to generate left-brain activity, and studies show that it produces positive emotions. Davidson studied the link between meditation and happiness through a project involving Tibetan Buddhist monks. His research brings together Eastern and Western traditions, and it links together objective reality with internal states of consciousness once thought to be subjective. The connection is made through observable electrical activity in the central nervous system. When the monks in the study meditated, their brain activity was recorded. Increases in left cerebral cortex activity indicate that the practice of meditation can, over time, change the structure of the brain, increasing the size and activity level of the left cerebral cortex.\nAnother practice that has been shown to stimulate left cerebral cortex activity and enhance feelings of happiness is the altering of conscious thoughts. More specifically, when a subject repeats positive affirmations_thinking optimistic thoughts-activity in the left cerebral cortex increases. As with the practice of meditation, the repetition of positive affirmations can change the structure of the brain over time, creating feelings of happiness and well-being. These findings show that the mind-body connection cannot be denied.\nThe author's claim that Watson's scientific study of happiness was startling is supported by:", "Answer Candidates": ["details about Watson's background and the publicity his study received", "the description of the study's subject", "the assertion that happiness was, at the time, desired but thought to be elusive and mysterious", "the fact that he conducted the study in 1930"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{C}$. You need to assess evidence for this question. Because authors ideally use examples to support their statements, you need to find the information that explains why Watson's study was thought to be startling. By scanning paragraph 2 for the exact reference, you will find that the second sentence contains the answer: \"Because happiness was considered a highly desired yet elusive and mysterious emotion, Watson's serious endeavor was startling.\u201d This is a clear giveaway that choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is correct.", "Final Answer": "C", "Images": []}

{"Problem Number": "3_3_3", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_3", "Problem Statement": "\nRecent research indicates that our experience of happiness can be self-regulated, regardless of external circumstances. We can actively choose to be happy. It was previously thought that levels of happiness were genetically determined; people were born with a genetic predisposition to cheerfulness or pessimism. However, studies now suggest that such predispositions, although present, are not fixed. Instead, emotion, and indeed the structure of the brain, can be modified through certain practices.\nThese findings are indebted to the work of psychologist Gordon Watson, who in 1930 conducted a study entitled \"Happiness Among Adult Students of Education.\" Because happiness was considered a highly desired yet elusive and mysterious emotion, Watson's serious endeavor was startling. By the 1970s, the psychological community was researching happiness on a larger scale. Today, it is estimated that over 2000 researchers in 42 countries are actively involved in happiness research.\nIn that crowded field, the work of a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Richard Davidson, stands out. Davidson observed patterns of brain activity as they related to a subject's mental and emotional states, using brain science's new technologies, including quantitative electrophysiology, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. He discovered what Western science once believed to be impossible: that the brain is not a static organ-it is able to change and develop over time. This capacity is known as neuroplasticity, and it has had a profound effect on the study of happiness.\nDavidson's studies found that the functions of the brain's cerebral cortex are not limited to determining intelligence, interpreting sensory impulses, and controlling motor function as once believed. In fact, this area also determines personality, including emotional predispositions. Levels of activity on the right and left sides of the cerebral cortex relate to feelings of happiness and sadness. Specifically, higher levels of activity at the left frontal area of the cerebral cortex coincide with feelings of happiness, For example, meditation has been shown to generate left-brain activity, and studies show that it produces positive emotions. Davidson studied the link between meditation and happiness through a project involving Tibetan Buddhist monks. His research brings together Eastern and Western traditions, and it links together objective reality with internal states of consciousness once thought to be subjective. The connection is made through observable electrical activity in the central nervous system. When the monks in the study meditated, their brain activity was recorded. Increases in left cerebral cortex activity indicate that the practice of meditation can, over time, change the structure of the brain, increasing the size and activity level of the left cerebral cortex.\nAnother practice that has been shown to stimulate left cerebral cortex activity and enhance feelings of happiness is the altering of conscious thoughts. More specifically, when a subject repeats positive affirmations_thinking optimistic thoughts-activity in the left cerebral cortex increases. As with the practice of meditation, the repetition of positive affirmations can change the structure of the brain over time, creating feelings of happiness and well-being. These findings show that the mind-body connection cannot be denied.\nAccording to the passage, all of these are TRUE EXCEPT:", "Answer Candidates": ["The brain is able to change over time, a process known as neuroplasticity.", "Science is attempting to prove there is a mind-body connection.", "Tibetan monks increase their left-side cerebral cortex activity through meditation.", "The right frontal area of the brain corresponds with feelings of sadness."], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{B}$.

In fact, when it comes to inflection, \nthe conditional, the subjunctive, the imperative, and others. Languages from outside the Indo-European family tree may be even more complex. The Bantu language of Kivunjo has roughly half a million combinations of prefixes and suffixes for a verb. English, however, has a mere four combinations. A verb such as to walk is limited to the following forms: walk, walks, walked, and walking.\nAlthough there are only four basic verb forms, the English language does have more than 13 possible inflections. It just makes do with these four forms for the various functions. English also differs significantly from many other Indo-European languages in that in English, the stem of the word can be pronounced and is in fact part of the language. In Spanish, the stem of the verb to walk is camin-, but this is not a word in the language. In order to pronounce this word, it must be conjugated and combined with a suffix. English uses the stem form of the verb for four inflections: the present tense (except for the third-person singular), the infinitive, the imperative, and the subjunctive. The verb form ending in $-s$ is used in only one case, the third-person singular.\nThe two possible verb suffixes, -ing and $-e d$, are put to use in a variety of ways as well. The -ing ending appears in the progressive participle, the present participle, the gerund form, and the verbal adjective form.

{"Problem Number": "3_3_4", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_3", "Problem Statement": "\nRecent research indicates that our experience of happiness can be self-regulated, regardless of external circumstances. We can actively choose to be happy. It was previously thought that levels of happiness were genetically determined; people were born with a genetic predisposition to cheerfulness or pessimism. However, studies now suggest that such predispositions, although present, are not fixed. Instead, emotion, and indeed the structure of the brain, can be modified through certain practices.\nThese findings are indebted to the work of psychologist Gordon Watson, who in 1930 conducted a study entitled \"Happiness Among Adult Students of Education.\" Because happiness was considered a highly desired yet elusive and mysterious emotion, Watson's serious endeavor was startling. By the 1970s, the psychological community was researching happiness on a larger scale. Today, it is estimated that over 2000 researchers in 42 countries are actively involved in happiness research.\nIn that crowded field, the work of a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Richard Davidson, stands out. Davidson observed patterns of brain activity as they related to a subject's mental and emotional states, using brain science's new technologies, including quantitative electrophysiology, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. He discovered what Western science once believed to be impossible: that the brain is not a static organ-it is able to change and develop over time. This capacity is known as neuroplasticity, and it has had a profound effect on the study of happiness.\nDavidson's studies found that the functions of the brain's cerebral cortex are not limited to determining intelligence, interpreting sensory impulses, and controlling motor function as once believed. In fact, this area also determines personality, including emotional predispositions. Levels of activity on the right and left sides of the cerebral cortex relate to feelings of happiness and sadness. Specifically, higher levels of activity at the left frontal area of the cerebral cortex coincide with feelings of happiness, For example, meditation has been shown to generate left-brain activity, and studies show that it produces positive emotions. Davidson studied the link between meditation and happiness through a project involving Tibetan Buddhist monks. His research brings together Eastern and Western traditions, and it links together objective reality with internal states of consciousness once thought to be subjective. The connection is made through observable electrical activity in the central nervous system. When the monks in the study meditated, their brain activity was recorded. Increases in left cerebral cortex activity indicate that the practice of meditation can, over time, change the structure of the brain, increasing the size and activity level of the left cerebral cortex.\nAnother practice that has been shown to stimulate left cerebral cortex activity and enhance feelings of happiness is the altering of conscious thoughts. More specifically, when a subject repeats positive affirmations_thinking optimistic thoughts-activity in the left cerebral cortex increases. As with the practice of meditation, the repetition of positive affirmations can change the structure of the brain over time, creating feelings of happiness and well-being. These findings show that the mind-body connection cannot be denied.\nBased on information in the passage, which of these outcomes should someone expect after silently repeating the phrase \"I am successful\" for 20 minutes?", "Answer Candidates": ["a feeling of well-being", "sadness", "a creative impulse", "fatigue"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is A. You are asked to identify cause and effect as it is implied in the passage for this question. Note that the example of a subject repeating the phrase, \"I am successful\" does not appear in the passage.

{"Problem Number": "3_3_5", "Topic": "MCAT Reading", "Source": "MCAT_3", "Problem Statement": "\nIn sharp contrast to the modern, confessional poetry of the 20th century, the oeuvre of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow seems quaint and primly Victorian. During his lifetime, however, he was the most celebrated poet in the country. A closer look at the history of American poetry reveals that, despite his eminence, Longfellow wrote in a mold of both form and content that was already being challenged during his lifetime. But why, a century later, do the artistic works of many of his contemporaries continue to be enjoyed and studied while Longfellow languishes in the tomb of cultural artifacts?\nOne answer lies in the radical shift that began to take place in poetry in the mid19th century. Longfellow's themes and steadfast rhymes (and those of John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell) gave way gradually to confessional verse, whose subjects were more personal and rhymes were looser and less conventional. But to understand this shift, one must first understand the nature of Longfellow's work and his standing in the American literary scene of his time.\nLongfellow took as his subject his country's historical imagination, writing on an epic scale about Paul Revere, the Indian Hiawatha, and the pilgrim Miles Standish. He bestowed a mythic dimension on these figures, giving American readers iconic images that helped form a collective consciousness in the new country (indeed, Longfellow was a part of the first generation to be born in the United States). But Longfellow's content went beyond nationalistic pride-it was highly accessible and incredibly popular. Its accessibility is explained by his obvious themes that could be easily understood and embraced by the public. Longfellow did not challenge his readers, but appealed to their desire for stories that expounded an optimistic, sentimental, and moralistic worldview. Those themes were explored in rhyme that allowed readers to commit the poems to memory, much like songs. In 1857, The Song of Hiawatha, arguably his bestknown poem, sold 50,000 copies, an astounding number at the time. The next year, The Courtship of Miles Standish sold 25,000 copies in two months and in London sold 10,000 copies in one day. His success allowed him to give up a professorship at Harvard and focus full time on his writing.\nWalt Whitman, Longfellow's contemporary, wrote poetry similar to that of Longfellow-romantic and sentimental, with conventional rhyme and meter. But in the 1850s, indeed two years before The Song of Hiawatha, he wrote and published Leaves of Grass; a more radical departure from his previous work could not have been imagined.

Because Longfellow's reputation is said to suffer because of these very themes and rhymes, it may be implied that the reputations of Whittier and Holmes suffer a similar fate. There is no evidence in the passage to support choice A, so it should be eliminated. Choice B is too negative; neither Longfellow nor Whittier and Holmes are said to be held in contempt or disdain.

During his lifetime, however, he was the most celebrated poet in the country. A closer look at the history of American poetry reveals that, despite his eminence, Longfellow wrote in a mold of both form and content that was already being challenged during his lifetime. But why, a century later, do the artistic works of many of his contemporaries continue to be enjoyed and studied while Longfellow languishes in the tomb of cultural artifacts?\nOne answer lies in the radical shift that began to take place in poetry in the mid19th century. Longfellow's themes and steadfast rhymes (and those of John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell) gave way gradually to confessional verse, whose subjects were more personal and rhymes were looser and less conventional. But to understand this shift, one must first understand the nature of Longfellow's work and his standing in the American literary scene of his time.\nLongfellow took as his subject his country's historical imagination, writing on an epic scale about Paul Revere, the Indian Hiawatha, and the pilgrim Miles Standish. He bestowed a mythic dimension on these figures, giving American readers iconic images that helped form a collective consciousness in the new country (indeed, Longfellow was a part of the first generation to be born in the United States). But Longfellow's content went beyond nationalistic pride-it was highly accessible and incredibly popular. Its accessibility is explained by his obvious themes that could be easily understood and embraced by the public. Longfellow did not challenge his readers, but appealed to their desire for stories that expounded an optimistic, sentimental, and moralistic worldview. Those themes were explored in rhyme that allowed readers to commit the poems to memory, much like songs. In 1857, The Song of Hiawatha, arguably his bestknown poem, sold 50,000 copies, an astounding number at the time.
