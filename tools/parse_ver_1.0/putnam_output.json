That any such function satisfies the given condition is easy to check.Now suppose there exists a nonconstant solution $f$. There must exist two positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $f(a)<f(b)$.

We can divide by $a+b>0$ to find that $f(a)<f\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\\right)<f(b)$. Thus between any two different values of $f$ we can insert another.

Suppose $n$ is a good number that has at least two distinct prime factors. Let $n=p^{r} s$, where $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n$ and $s$ is not divisible by $p$. Because $n$ is good, $p+s-1$ must divide $n$. For any prime $q$ dividing $s, s<p+s-1<s+q$, so $q$ does not divide $p+s-1$. Therefore, the only prime factor of $p+s-1$ is $p$. Then $s=p^{c}-p+1$ for some integer $c>1$. Because $p^{c}$ must also divide $n, p^{c}+s-1=2 p^{c}-p$ divides $n$. Because $2 p^{c-1}-1$ has no factors of $p$, it must divide $s$.

It is natural to try to simplify the product, and for this we make use of the AM-GM inequality:$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{25}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{365}\\right) \\leq\\left[\\frac{1}{25} \\sum_{n=1}^{25}\\left(1-\\frac{n}{365}\\right)\\right]^{25}=\\left(\\frac{352}{365}\\right)^{25}=\\left(1-\\frac{13}{365}\\right)^{25} . $$We now use Newton's binomial formula to estimate this power. First, note that$$ \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 25 \\\\ k \\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\frac{13}{365}\\right)^{k} \\geq\\left(\\begin{array}{c} 25 \\\\ k+1 \\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\frac{13}{365}\\right)^{k+1}, $$since this reduces to$$ \\frac{13}{365} \\leq \\frac{k+1}{25-k}, $$and the latter is always true for $1 \\leq k \\leq 24$. For this reason if we ignore the part of the binomial expansion beginning with the fourth term, we increase the value of the expression. In other words,$$ \\left(1-\\frac{13}{365}\\right)^{25} \\leq 1-\\left(\\begin{array}{c} 25 \\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right) \\frac{13}{365}+\\left(\\begin{array}{c} 25 \\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right) \\frac{13^{2}}{365^{2}}=1-\\frac{65}{73}+\\frac{169 \\cdot 12}{63^{2}}<\\frac{1}{2} . $$We conclude that the second number is larger.(Soviet Union University Student Mathematical Olympiad, 1975) ",

Note that $E\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)>\\frac{x_{n}^{2}}{n}$, which shows that as the variables tend to infinity, so does the expression. This means that the minimum exists. Assume that the minimum is attained at the point $\\left(y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots, y_{n}\\right)$. If $y_{n}-y_{1}>n$ then there exist indices $i$ and $j, i<j$, such that $y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{i}+1, \\ldots, y_{j}-1, \\ldots, y_{n}$ are still distinct integers.

This contradicts the minimality. We now look at the case with no gaps: $y_{n}-y_{1}=n-1$. Then there exists $a$ such that $y_{1}=a+1, y_{2}=a+2, \\ldots, y_{n}=a+n$.

We would like to translate the third and fifth powers into trigonometric functions of multiples of the angles. For that we use the polynomials $\\mathcal{T}_{n}(a)$.

This translates into the trigonometric identity $2 \\cos 5 \\theta=(2 \\cos \\theta)^{5}-5(2 \\cos \\theta)^{3}+5(2 \\cos \\theta)$.Add to the third equation of the system the first multiplied by 5 and the second multiplied by $-5$, then use the above-mentioned trigonometric identity to obtain$$ 2 \\cos 5 t_{1}+2 \\cos 5 t_{2}+2 \\cos 5 t_{3}+2 \\cos 5 t_{4}+2 \\cos 5 t_{5}=-10 . $$This can happen only if $\\cos 5 t_{1}=\\cos 5 t_{2}=\\cos 5 t_{3}=\\cos 5 t_{5}=\\cos 5 t_{5}=-1$.

Also, it is not hard to see that the equation $\\mathcal{T}_{5}(a)=-2$ has no rational solutions, which implies that $\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{5}$ is irrational.The first equation of the system yields $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} t_{i}=0$, and the above considerations show that this can happen only when two of the $t_{i}$ are equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{5}$, two are equal to $\\frac{3 \\pi}{5}$, and one is equal to $\\pi$. Let us show that in this situation the second equation is also satisfied. Using $\\mathcal{T}_{3}(a)=a^{3}-3 a$, we see that the first two equations are jointly equivalent to $\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\cos t_{i}=0$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\cos 3 t_{i}=0$.

The matrix $J_{m}(\\lambda)$ is called a Jordan block. It is part of the Jordan canonical form of a matrix. Specifically, given a square matrix $A$ there exists an invertible matrix $S$ such that $S^{-1} A S$ is a block diagonal matrix whose blocks are matrices of the form $J_{m_{i}}\\left(\\lambda_{i}\\right)$. The numbers $\\lambda_{i}$ are the eigenvalues of $A$. As a consequence of this problem, we obtain a standard method for raising a matrix to the $n$th power.

From such an inequality we would derive $a_{n+1}=3^{a_{n}}>3^{u}\\left(3^{v}\\right)^{b_{m}}$. If $3^{v}>100$, then $a_{n+1}>3^{u} b_{m+1}$, and if $3^{u}>u+v$, then we would obtain $a_{n+1}>u+v b_{m+1}$, the same inequality as the one we started with, but with $m+1$ and $n+1$ instead of $m$ and $n$.The inequality $3^{v}>100$ holds for $v=5$, and $3^{u}>u+5$ holds for $u=2$.

Write the equation as$$ \\sqrt{x+2 \\sqrt{x+\\cdots+2 \\sqrt{x+2 \\sqrt{x+2 x}}}}=x . $$We can iterate this equality infinitely many times, always replacing the very last $x$ by its value given by the left-hand side. We conclude that $x$ should satisfy$$ \\sqrt{x+2 \\sqrt{x+2 \\sqrt{x+2 \\cdots}}}=x, $$provided that the expression on the left makes sense! Let us check that indeed the recursive sequence given by $x_{0}=x$, and $x_{n+1}=\\sqrt{x+2 x_{n}}, n \\geq 0$, converges for any solution $x$ to the original equation. Squaring the equation, we find that $x<x^{2}$, hence $x>1$. But then $x_{n+1}<x_{n}$, because it reduces to $x_{n}^{2}-2 x_{n}+x>0$. This is always true, since when viewed as a quadratic function in $x_{n}$, the left-hand side has negative discriminant.

        "Solution": "350. The answer to the question is yes. We claim that for any sequence of positive integers $n_{k}$, there exists a number $\\gamma>1$ such that $\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\gamma^{k}\\right\\rfloor\\right)_{k}$ and $\\left(n_{k}\\right)_{k}$ have infinitely many terms in common.

For any $\\alpha, \\beta, 1<\\alpha<\\beta$, the set $\\cup_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\left[\\alpha^{k}, \\beta^{k}-1\\right]$ contains some interval of the form $(a, \\infty)$Proof. Observe that $(\\beta \/ \\alpha)^{k} \\rightarrow \\infty$ as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$. Hence for large $k, \\alpha^{k+1}<\\beta^{k}-1$, and the lemma follows.Let us return to the problem and prove the claim. Fix the numbers $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\beta_{1}$, $1<\\alpha_{1}<\\beta_{1}$. Using the lemma we can find some $k_{1}$ such that the interval $\\left[\\alpha_{1}^{k_{1}}, \\beta_{1}^{k_{1}}-1\\right]$ contains some terms of the sequence $\\left(n_{k}\\right)_{k}$. Choose one of these terms and call it $t_{1}$. Define$$ \\alpha_{2}=t_{1}^{1 \/ k_{1}}, \\quad \\beta_{2}=\\left(t_{1}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1 \/ k_{1}} $$Then $\\left[\\alpha_{2}, \\beta_{2}\\right] \\subset\\left[\\alpha_{1}, \\beta_{1}\\right]$, and for any $x \\in\\left[\\alpha_{2}, \\beta_{2}\\right],\\left\\lfloor x^{k_{1}}\\right\\rfloor=t_{1}$. Again by the lemma, there exists $k_{2}$ such that $\\left[\\alpha_{2}^{k_{2}}, \\beta_{2}^{k_{2}}-1\\right]$ contains a term of $\\left(n_{k}\\right)_{k}$ different from $n_{1}$. Call this term $t_{2}$.

Repeat the construction infinitely many times. By Cantor's nested intervals theorem, the intersection of the decreasing sequence of intervals $\\left[\\alpha_{j}, \\beta_{j}\\right], j=1,2, \\ldots$, is nonempty. Let $\\gamma$ be an element of this intersection. Then $\\left\\lfloor\\gamma^{k_{j}}\\right\\rfloor=t_{j}, j=1,2, \\ldots$, which shows that the sequence $\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\gamma^{j}\\right\\rfloor\\right)_{j}$ contains a subset of the sequence $\\left(n_{k}\\right)_{k}$. This proves the claim. To conclude the solution to the problem, assume that the sequence $\\left(a_{n}\\right)_{n}$ does not converge to 0 . Then it has some subsequence $\\left(a_{n_{k}}\\right)_{k}$ that approaches a nonzero (finite or infinite) limit as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. But we saw above that this subsequence has infinitely many terms in common with a sequence that converges to zero, namely with some $\\left(a_{\\left\\lfloor\\gamma^{k}\\right\\rfloor}\\right)_{k}$. This is a contradiction. Hence the sequence $\\left(a_{n}\\right)_{n}$ converges to 0 .(Soviet Union University Student Mathematical Olympiad, 1975)",

        "Problem Statement": "393. Give an example of a continuous function on an interval that is nowhere differentiable.",
        "Solution": "393. The first example of such a function was given by Weierstrass. The example we present here, of a function $f:[0,1] \\rightarrow[0,1]$, was published by S. Marcus in the Mathematics Gazette, Bucharest.If $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $x=0 . a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} \\ldots$ is the ternary expansion of $x$, we let the binary representation of $f(x)$ be $0 . b_{1} b_{2} b_{3} \\ldots$, where the binary digits $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, \\ldots$ are uniquely determined by the conditions(i) $b_{1}=1$ if and only if $a_{1}=1$,(ii) $b_{n+1}=b_{n}$ if and only if $a_{n+1}=a_{n}, n \\geq 1$.It is not hard to see that $f(x)$ does not depend on which ternary representation you choose for $x$. For example,$$ f(0.0222 \\ldots)=0.0111 \\cdots=0.1000 \\cdots=f(0.1000 \\ldots) . $$Let us prove first that the function is continuous. If $x$ is a number that has a unique ternary expansion and $\\left(x_{n}\\right)_{n}$ is a sequence converging to $x$, then the first $m$ digits of $x_{n}$ become equal to the first $m$ digits of $x$ for $n$ sufficiently large. It follows from the definition of $f$ that the first $m$ binary digits of $f\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ become equal to the first $m$ binary digits of $f(x)$ for $n$ sufficiently large. Hence $f\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ converges to $f(x)$, so $f$ is continuous at $x$.If $x$ is a number that has two possible ternary expansions, then in one expansion $x$ has only finitely many nonzero digits $x=0 . a_{1} a_{2} \\ldots a_{k} 00 \\ldots$, with $a_{k} \\neq 0$. The other expansion is $0 . a_{1} a_{2} \\ldots a_{k}^{\\prime} 222 \\ldots$, with $a_{k}^{\\prime}=a_{k}-1(=0$ or 1 ). Given a sequence $\\left(x_{n}\\right)_{n}$ that converges to $x$, for sufficiently large $n$ the first $k-1$ digits of $x_{n}$ are equal to $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k-1}$, while the next $m-k+1$ are either $a_{k}, 0,0, \\ldots, 0$, or $a_{k}^{\\prime}, 2,2, \\ldots, 2$. If $f(x)=f\\left(0 . a_{1} a_{2} \\ldots a_{k} 00 \\ldots\\right)=0 . b_{1} b_{2} b_{3} \\ldots$, then for $n$ sufficiently large, the first $k-1$ digits of $f\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ are $b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{k-1}$, while the next $m-k+1$ are either $b_{k}, b_{k+1}=$ $b_{k+2}=\\cdots=b_{m}$ (the digits of $\\left.f(x)\\right)$ or $1-b_{k}, 1-b_{k+1}=\\cdots=1-b_{m}$. The two possible binary numbers are $0 . b_{1} b_{2} \\ldots b_{k-1} 0111 \\ldots$ and $0 . b_{1} b_{2} \\ldots b_{k-1} 1000 \\ldots$; they differ from $f(x)$ by at most $\\frac{1}{2^{m+1}}$. We conclude again that as $n \\rightarrow \\infty, f\\left(x_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow f(x)$. This proves the continuity of $f$.Let us show next that $f$ does not have a finite derivative from the left at any point $x \\in(0,1]$. For such $x$ consider the ternary expansion $x=0 . a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} \\ldots$ that has infinitely many nozero digits, and, applying the definition of $f$ for this expansion, let $f(x)=$ $0 . b_{1} b_{2} b_{3} \\ldots$. Now consider an arbitrary positive number $n$, and let $k_{n} \\geq n$ be such that $a_{k_{n}} \\neq 0$. Construct a number $x^{\\prime} \\in(0,1)$ whose first $k_{n}-1$ digits are the same as those of $x$, whose $k_{n}$ th digit is zero, and all of whose other digits are equal to 0 if $b_{k_{n}+1}=1$ and to 1 if $b_{k_{n}+1}=0$. Then$$ 0<x-x^{\\prime}<2 \\cdot 3^{-k_{n}}+0 . \\underbrace{00 \\ldots 0}_{k_{n}} 22 \\ldots, 0=3^{-k_{n}+1}, $$while in the first case,$$ \\left|f(x)-f\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right| \\geq 0 . \\underbrace{00 \\ldots 0}_{k_{n}} b_{k_{n}+1}=0 . \\underbrace{00 \\ldots 0}_{k_{n}} 1, $$and in the second case,$$ \\left|f(x)-f\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)\\right| \\geq 0 . \\underbrace{00 \\ldots 0}_{k_{n}} 11 \\ldots 1-0 . \\underbrace{00 \\ldots 0}_{k_{n}} 0 b_{k_{n}+2 \\ldots,} $$and these are both greater than or equal to $2^{-k_{n}-1}$. Since $k_{n} \\geq n$, we have $0<x-x^{\\prime}<$ $3^{-n+1}$ and$$ \\left|\\frac{f(x)-f\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)}{x-x^{\\prime}}\\right|>\\frac{2^{-k_{n}-1}}{3^{-k_{n}+1}}=\\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{k_{n}} \\geq \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{n} . $$Letting $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, we obtain$$ x^{\\prime} \\rightarrow x, \\quad \\text { while }\\left|\\frac{f(x)-f\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)}{x-x^{\\prime}}\\right| \\rightarrow \\infty . $$This proves that $f$ does not have a derivative on the left at $x$. The argument that $f$ does not have a derivative on the right at $x$ is similar and is left to the reader.Remark. S. Banach has shown that in some sense, there are far more continuous functions that are not differentiable at any point than continuous functions that are differentiable at least at some point.",

        "Solution": "399. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the cars traveled on one day from $A$ to $B$ keeping a distance of at most one mile between them, and on the next day they traveled in opposite directions in the same time interval, which we assume to be of length one unit of time.Since the first car travels in both days on the same road and in the same direction, it defines two parametrizations of that road. Composing the motions of both cars during the second day of travel with a homeomorphism (continuous bijection) of the time interval $[0,1]$, we can ensure that the motion of the first car yields the same parametrization of the road on both days. Let $f(t)$ be the distance from the second car to $A$ when the first is at $t$ on the first day, and $g(t)$ the distance from the second car to $A$ when the first is at $t$ on the second day. These two functions are continuous, so their difference is also continuous. But $f(0)-g(0)=-\\operatorname{dist}(A, B)$, and $f(1)-g(1)=\\operatorname{dist}(A, B)$, where $\\operatorname{dist}(A, B)$ is the distance between the cities.The intermediate value property implies that there is a moment $t$ for which $f(t)-$ $g(t)=0$. At that moment the two cars are in the same position as they were the day before, so they are at distance at most one mile. Hence the answer to the problem is no. ",

This can happen only if either $a=b$ or $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$, so either the triangle is isosceles, or it is right. Repeating this for all three pairs of sides we find that either $b=c$ or $b^{2}+c^{2}=a^{2}$, and also that either $a=c$ or $a^{2}+c^{2}=b^{2}$. Since at most one equality of the form $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$ can hold, we see that, in fact, all three sides must be equal.

        "Solution": "539. No! In fact, we will prove a more general result.Proposition. Let $S$ be a set and $g: S \\rightarrow S$ a function that has exactly two fixed points $\\{a, b\\}$ and such that $g \\circ g$ has exactly four fixed points $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$. Then there is no function $f: S \\rightarrow S$ such that $g=f \\circ f$. Proof. Let $g(c)=y$. Then $c=g(g(c))=g(y)$; hence $y=g(c)=g(g(y))$. Thus $y$ is a fixed point of $g \\circ g$. If $y=a$, then $a=g(a)=g(y)=c$, leading to a contradiction. Similarly, $y=b$ forces $c=b$. If $y=c$, then $c=g(y)=g(c)$, so $c$ is a fixed point of $g$, again a contradiction. It follows that $y=d$, i.e., $g(c)=d$, and similarly $g(d)=c$.Suppose there is $f: S \\rightarrow S$ such that $f \\circ f=g$. Then $f \\circ g=f \\circ f \\circ f=g \\circ f$. Then $f(a)=f(g(a))=g(f(a))$, so $f(a)$ is a fixed point of $g$. Examining case by case, we conclude that $f(\\{a, b\\}) \\subset\\{a, b\\}$ and $f(\\{a, b, c, d\\}) \\subset\\{a, b, c, d\\}$. Because $f \\circ f=g$, the inclusions are, in fact, equalities.Consider $f(c)$. If $f(c)=a$, then $f(a)=f(f(c))=g(c)=d$, a contradiction since $f(a)$ is in $\\{a, b\\}$. Similarly, we rule out $f(c)=b$. Of course, $c$ is not a fixed point of $f$, since it is not a fixed point of $g$. We are left with the only possibility $f(c)=d$. But then $f(d)=f(f(c))=g(c)=d$, and this again cannot happen because $d$ is not a fixed point of $g$. We conclude that such a function $f$ cannot exist.In the particular case of our problem, $g(x)=x^{2}-2$ has the fixed points $-1$ and 2 , and $g(g(x))=\\left(x^{2}-2\\right)^{2}-2$ has the fixed points $-1,2, \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, and $\\frac{-1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.

        "Solution": "552. The relation from the statement implies that $f$ is injective, so it must be monotonic. Let us show that $f$ is increasing. Assuming the existence of a decreasing solution $f$ to the functional equation, we can find $x_{0}$ such that $f\\left(x_{0}\\right) \\neq x_{0}$. Rewrite the functional equation as $f(f(x))-f(x)=f(x)-x$. If $f\\left(x_{0}\\right)<x_{0}$, then $f\\left(f\\left(x_{0}\\right)\\right)<f\\left(x_{0}\\right)$, and if $f\\left(x_{0}\\right)>x_{0}$, then $f\\left(f\\left(x_{0}\\right)\\right)>f\\left(x_{0}\\right)$, which both contradict the fact that $f$ is decreasing.

On the intervals $I_{1}=$ $(-\\infty, 0), I_{2}=\\left(0, x_{0}\\right)$, and $I_{3}=\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$ the function $f-g$ is nonzero; hence so is $f^{\\prime}+g^{\\prime}$.

If on any of these intervals $f-g=f^{\\prime}+g^{\\prime}$, then since $f+g=g^{\\prime}-f^{\\prime}$ it follows that $f=g^{\\prime}$ on that interval, and so $g^{\\prime}+g=g^{\\prime}-g^{\\prime \\prime}$. This implies that $g$ satisfies the equation $g^{\\prime \\prime}+g=0$, or that $g(x)=A \\sin x+B \\cos x$ on that interval.

Hence $g(x)=C_{1} e^{x}$. From the fact that $f=-f^{\\prime}$, we obtain $f(x)=C_{2} e^{-x}$.Assuming that $f$ and $g$ are exponentials on the interval $\\left(0, x_{0}\\right)$, we deduce that $C_{1}=g(0)=f(0)=C_{2}$ and that $C_{1} e^{x_{0}}=g\\left(x_{0}\\right)=f\\left(x_{0}\\right)=C_{2} e^{-x}$. These two inequalities cannot hold simultaneously, unless $f$ and $g$ are identically zero, ruled out by the hypothesis of the problem.

The associated homogeneous equation can be written as$$ x\\left(y^{\\prime \\prime}+4 y^{\\prime}+4 y\\right)-\\left(y^{\\prime \\prime}+5 y^{\\prime}+6 y\\right)=0, $$and the equations $y^{\\prime \\prime}+4 y^{\\prime}+4 y=0$ and $y^{\\prime \\prime}+5 y^{\\prime}+6 y=0$ have the common solution $y(x)=e^{-2 x}$.

Its age-old theorems and the sharp logic of its proofs make you think of the words of Andrew Wiles, \"Mathematics seems to have a permanence that nothing else has.\"This chapter is bound to take you away from the geometry of the ancients, with figures and pictorial intuition, and bring you to the science of numbers and equations that geometry has become today. In a dense exposition we have packed vectors and their applications, analytical geometry in the plane and in space, some applications of integral calculus to geometry, followed by a list of problems with Euclidean flavor but based on algebraic and combinatorial ideas. Special attention is given to conics and quadrics, for their study already contains the germs of differential and algebraic geometry.Four subsections are devoted to geometry's little sister, trigonometry. We insist on trigonometric identities, repeated in subsequent sections from different perspectives: Euler's formula, trigonometric substitutions, and telescopic summation and multiplication.Since geometry lies at the foundation of mathematics, its presence could already be felt in the sections on linear algebra and multivariable calculus. It will resurface again in the chapter on combinatorics.",
        "Solution": "572. The idea is to use an \"integrating factor\"' that transforms the quantity under the integral into the derivative of a function. We already encountered this situation in a previous problem, and should recognize that the integrating factor is $e^{-x}$.

As a function of the coordinates $(x, y)$ of $P$, the distance from $P$ to a line is of the form $m x+n y+p$. Combining three such functions, we see that $f(P)=f(x, y)$ is of the same form, $f(x, y)=\\alpha x+\\beta y+\\gamma$. To solve the inequality $f(x, y)>0$ it suffices to find the line $f(x, y)=0$ and determine on which side of the line the function is positive. The line intersects the side $B C$ where $\\delta(P, C A)=\\delta(P, A B)$, hence at the point $E$ where the angle bisector from $A$ intersects this side. It intersects side $C A$ at the point $F$ where the bisector from $B$ intersects the side. Also, $f(x, y)>0$ on side $A B$, hence on the same side of the line $E F$ as the segment $A B$. Arguing similarly for the other two inequalities, we deduce that the locus is the interior of the triangle formed by the points where the angle bisectors meet the opposite sides.",

        "Solution": "611. An equilateral triangle can be inscribed in any closed, non-self-intersecting curve, therefore also in an ellipse. The argument runs as follows. Choose a point $A$ on the ellipse. Rotate the ellipse around $A$ by $60^{\\circ}$. The image of the ellipse through the rotation intersects the original ellipse once in $A$, so it should intersect it at least one more time. Let $B$ an be intersection point different from $A$. Note that $B$ is on both ellipses, and its preimage $C$ through rotation is on the original ellipse. The triangle $A B C$ is equilateral.A square can also be inscribed in the ellipse. It suffices to vary an inscribed rectangle with sides parallel to the axes of the ellipse and use the intermediate value property.Let us show that these are the only possibilities. Up to a translation, a rotation, and a dilation, the equation of the ellipse has the form$$ x^{2}+a y^{2}=b, \\quad \\text { with } a, b>0, a \\neq 1 . $$Assume that a regular $n$-gon, $n \\geq 5$, can be inscribed in the ellipse. Its vertices $\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ satisfy the equation of the circumcircle: $$ x^{2}+y^{2}+c x+d y+e=0, \\quad i=1,2, \\ldots, n . $$Writing the fact that the vertices also satisfy the equation of the ellipse and subtracting, we obtain $(1-a) y_{i}^{2}+c x_{i}+d y_{i}+(e+b)=0$. Hence$$ y_{i}^{2}=-\\frac{c}{1-a} x_{i}-\\frac{d}{1-a} y_{i}-\\frac{e+b}{1-a} . $$The number $c$ cannot be 0 , for otherwise the quadratic equation would have two solutions $y_{i}$ and each of these would yield two solutions $x_{i}$, so the polygon would have four or fewer sides, a contradiction. This means that the regular polygon is inscribed in a parabola. Change the coordinates so that the parabola has the standard equation $y^{2}=4 p x$. Let the new coordinates of the vertices be $\\left(\\xi_{i}, \\eta_{i}\\right)$ and the new equation of the circumcircle be $x^{2}+y^{2}+c^{\\prime} x+d^{\\prime} y+e^{\\prime}=0$.

Our goal is to map the circle onto a cardioid of the form$$ r=a(1+\\cos \\theta), \\quad a>0 . $$Because this cardioid passes through the origin, it is natural to work with a circle that itself passes through the origin, for example $|z-1|=1$. If $\\phi: \\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ maps this circle into the cardioid, then the equation of the cardioid will have the form$$ \\left|\\phi^{-1}(z)-1\\right|=1 . $$So we want to bring the original equation of the cardioid into this form. First, we change it to$$ r=a \\cdot 2 \\cos ^{2} \\frac{\\theta}{2} ; $$then we take the square root,$$ \\sqrt{r}=\\sqrt{2 a} \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2} . $$Multiplying by $\\sqrt{r}$, we obtain$$ r=\\sqrt{2 a} \\sqrt{r} \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2}, $$or$$ r-\\sqrt{2 a} \\sqrt{r} \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2}=0 . $$This should look like the equation of a circle.

Of course, there is an ambiguity in taking the square root, but we are really interested in the transformation $\\phi$, not in $\\phi^{-1}$. Therefore, we can choose $\\phi(z)=z^{2}$, which maps the circle $|z-1|=1$ into the cardioid $r=2(1+\\cos \\theta)$.Remark. Of greater practical importance is the Zhukovski transformation $z \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}\\left(z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$, which maps the unit circle onto the profile of the airplane wing (the so-called aerofoil).

        "Solution": "625. Let the equation of the curve be $y(x)$. Let $T(x)$ be the tension in the chain at the point $(x, y(x))$. The tension acts in the direction of the derivative $y^{\\prime}(x)$. Let $H(x)$ and $V(x)$ be, respectively, the horizontal and vertical components of the tension. Because the chain is in equilibrium, the horizontal component of the tension is constant at all points of the chain (just cut the chain mentally at two different points). Thus $H(x)=H$. The vertical component of the tension is then $V(x)=H y^{\\prime}(x)$. On the other hand, for two infinitesimally close points, the difference in the vertical tension is given by $d V=\\rho d s$, where $\\rho$ is the density of the chain and $d s$ is the length of the arc between the two poins. Since $d s=\\sqrt{1+\\left(y^{\\prime}(x)\\right)^{2}} d x$, it follows that $y$ satisfies the differential equation$$ H y^{\\prime \\prime}=\\rho \\sqrt{1+\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)^{2}} . $$If we set $z(x)=y^{\\prime}(x)$, we obtain the separable first-order equation$$ H z^{\\prime}=\\rho \\sqrt{1+z^{2}} . $$By integration, we obtain $z=\\sinh \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{H} x+C_{1}\\right)$.

Because of the condition $a>b>c$, a circular cross-section cannot lie in the $x y$-, $x z-$, or $y z$-plane.

Hence the radius of the circle is at most $b$. The same argument for the $x y$-plane shows that the radius is at least $b$, whence $b$ is a good candidate for the maximum radius.To show that circular cross-sections of radius $b$ actually exist, consider the intersection of the plane $\\left(c \\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}\\right) x=\\left(a \\sqrt{b^{2}-c^{2}}\\right) z$ with the ellipsoid.

        "Solution": "662. We will prove that a function of the form $f(x, y)=\\cos (a x+b y), a, b$ integers, can be written as a polynomial in $\\cos x, \\cos y$, and $\\cos (x+k y)$ if and only if $b$ is divisible by $k$.For example, if $b=k$, then from$$ \\cos (a x+k y)=2 \\cos x \\cos ((a \\pm 1) x+k y)-\\cos ((a \\pm 2) x+k y), $$we obtain by induction on the absolute value of $a$ that $\\cos (a x+b y)$ is a polynomial in $\\cos x, \\cos y, \\cos (x+k y)$. In general, if $b=c k$, the identity$$ \\cos (a x+c k y)=2 \\cos y \\cos (a x+(c \\pm 1) k y)-\\cos (a x+(c \\pm 2) k y) $$together with the fact that $\\cos a x$ is a polynomial in $\\cos x$ allows an inductive proof of the fact that $\\cos (a x+b y)$ can be written as a polynomial in $\\cos x, \\cos y$, and $\\cos (x+k y)$ as well.For the converse, note that by using the product-to-sum formula we can write any polynomial in cosines as a linear combination of cosines. We will prove a more general statement, namely that if a linear combination of cosines is a polynomial in $\\cos x, \\cos y$, and $\\cos (x+k y)$, then it is of the form$$ \\sum_{m}\\left[b_{m} \\cos m x+\\sum_{0 \\leq q<|p|} c_{m, p, q}(\\cos (m x+(p k+q) y)+\\cos (m x+(p k-q) y))\\right] \\text {. } $$This property is obviously true for polynomials of degree one, since any such polynomial is just a linear combination of the three functions. Also, any polynomial in $\\cos x, \\cos y, \\cos (x+k y)$ can be obtained by adding polynomials of lower degrees, and eventually multiplying them by one of the three functions.Hence it suffices to show that the property is invariant under multiplication by $\\cos x, \\cos y$, and $\\cos (x+k y)$. It can be verified that this follows from$$ \\begin{aligned} 2 \\cos (a x+b y) \\cos x &=\\cos ((a+1) x+b y)+\\cos ((a-1) x+b y) \\\\ 2 \\cos (a x+b y) \\cos y &=\\cos (a x+(b+1) y)+\\cos (a x+(b-1) y) \\\\ 2 \\cos (a x+b y) \\cos (x+k y) &=\\cos ((a+1) x+(b+k) y)+\\cos (a-1) x+(b-k) y) \\end{aligned} $$So for $\\cos (a x+b y)$ to be a polynomial in $\\cos x, \\cos y$, and $\\cos (x+k y)$, it must be such a sum with a single term. This can happen only if $b$ is divisible by $k$.The answer to the problem is therefore $k=\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 9, \\pm 11, \\pm 33, \\pm 99$.(proposed by R.

        "Solution": "705. Setting $x=y=z=0$ we find that $f(0)=3(f(0))^{3}$. This cubic equation has the unique integer solution $f(0)=0$. Next, with $y=-x$ and $z=0$ we have $f(0)=$ $(f(x))^{3}+(f(-x))^{3}+(f(0))^{3}$, which yields $f(-x)=-f(x)$ for all integers $x$; hence $f$ is an odd function. Now set $x=1, y=z=0$ to obtain $f(1)=(f(1))^{3}+2(f(0))^{3}$; hence $f(1)=f(1)^{3}$. Therefore, $f(1) \\in\\{-1,0,1\\}$.

We will do this by strong induction on the absolute value of $x$, and for that we need the following lemma.Lemma. If $x$ is an integer whose absolute value is greater than 3, then $x^{3}$ can be written as the sum of five cubes whose absolute values are less than $x$.Proof. We have$$ \\begin{array}{ll} 4^{3}=3^{3}+3^{3}+2^{3}+1^{3}+1^{3}, & 5^{3}=4^{3}+4^{3}+(-1)^{3}+(-1)^{3}+(-1)^{3}, \\\\ 6^{3}=5^{3}+4^{3}+3^{3}+0^{3}+0^{3}, & 7^{3}=6^{3}+5^{3}+1^{3}+1^{3}+0^{3} \\end{array} $$and if $x=2 k+1$ with $k>3$, then$$ x^{3}=(2 k+1)^{3}=(2 k-1)^{3}+(k+4)^{3}+(4-k)^{3}+(-5)^{3}+(-1)^{3} . $$In this last case it is not hard to see that $2 k-1, k+4,|4-k|, 5$, and 1 are all less than $2 k+1$. If $x>3$ is an arbitrary integer, then we write $x=m y$, where $y$ is 4,6 , or an odd number greater than 3 , and $m$ is an integer. If we express $y^{3}=y_{1}^{3}+y_{2}^{3}+y_{3}^{3}+y_{4}^{3}+y_{5}^{3}$, then $x^{3}=\\left(m y_{1}\\right)^{3}+\\left(m y_{2}\\right)^{3}+\\left(m y_{3}\\right)^{3}+\\left(m y_{4}\\right)^{3}+\\left(m y_{5}\\right)^{3}$, and the lemma is proved.Returning to the problem, using the fact that $f$ is odd and what we proved before, we see that $f(x)=x f(1)$ for $|x| \\leq 3$. For $x>4$, suppose that $f(y)=y f(1)$ for all $y$ with $|y|<|x|$. Using the lemma write $x^{3}=x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+x_{3}^{3}+x_{4}^{3}+x_{5}^{3}$, where $\\left|x_{i}\\right|<|x|$, $i=1,2,3,4,5$. After writing$$ x^{3}+\\left(-x_{4}\\right)^{3}+\\left(-x_{5}\\right)^{3}=x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+x_{3}^{3}, $$we apply $f$ to both sides and use the fact that $f$ is odd and the condition from the statement to obtain$$ (f(x))^{3}-\\left(f\\left(x_{4}\\right)\\right)^{3}-\\left(f\\left(x_{5}\\right)\\right)^{3}=f\\left(x_{1}\\right)^{3}+f\\left(x_{2}\\right)^{3}+f\\left(x_{3}\\right)^{3} . $$The inductive hypothesis yields$$ (f(x))^{3}-\\left(x_{4} f(1)\\right)^{3}-\\left(x_{5} f(1)\\right)^{3}=\\left(x_{1} f(1)\\right)^{3}+\\left(x_{2} f(1)\\right)^{3}+\\left(x_{3} f(1)\\right)^{3} ; $$hence$$ (f(x))^{3}=\\left(x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+x_{3}^{3}+x_{4}^{3}+x_{5}^{3}\\right)(f(1))^{3}=x^{3}(f(1))^{3} . $$Hence $f(x)=x f(1)$, and the induction is complete. Therefore, the only answers to the problem are $f(x)=-x$ for all $x, f(x)=0$ for all $x$, and $f(x)=x$ for all $x$. That these satisfy the given equation is a straightforward exercise.(American Mathematical Monthly, proposed by T. Andreescu)",

        "Solution": "712. The divisibility condition can be written as$$ k(a b+a+b)=a^{2}+b^{2}+1, $$where $k$ is a positive integer. The small values of $k$ are easy to solve. For example, $k=1$ yields $a b+a+b=a^{2}+b^{2}+1$, which is equivalent to $(a-b)^{2}+(a-1)^{2}+(b-1)^{2}=0$, whose only solution is $a=b=1$. Also, for $k=2$ we have $2 a b+2 a+2 b=a^{2}+b^{2}+1$. This can be rewritten either as $4 a=(b-a-1)^{2}$ or as $4 b=(b-a+1)^{2}$, showing that both $a$ and $b$ are perfect squares. Assuming that $a \\leq b$, we see that $(b-a-1)-(b-a+1)=2$, and hence $a$ and $b$ are consecutive squares. We obtain as an infinite family of solutions the pairs of consecutive perfect squares.Now let us examine the case $k \\geq 3$. This is where we apply Fermat's infinite descent method. Again we assume that $a \\leq b$. A standard approach is to interpret the divisibility condition as a quadratic equation in $b$ :$$ b^{2}-k(a+1) b+\\left(a^{2}-k a+1\\right)=0 . $$Because one of the roots, namely $b$, is an integer, the other root must be an integer, too (the sum of the roots is $k(a+1)$ ). Thus we may substitute the pair $(a, b)$ by the smaller pair $(r, a)$, provided that $0<r<a$. Let us verify first that $0<r$. Assume the contrary. Since $b r=a^{2}-k a+1$, we must have $a^{2}-k a+1 \\leq 0$. The equality case is impossible, since $a(k-a)=1$ cannot hold if $k \\geq 3$. If $a^{2}-k a+1<0$, the original divisibility condition implies $b(b-a k-k)=a k-a^{2}-1>0$, hence $b-a k-k>0$. But then $b(b-a k-k)>$ $(a k+k) \\cdot 1>a k-a^{2}-1$, a contradiction. This proves that $r$ is positive. From the fact that $b r=a^{2}-k a+1<a^{2}$ and $b \\geq a$, it follows that $r<a$. Successively, we obtain the sequence of pairs of solutions to the original problem $\\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\\right)=(a, b),\\left(a_{2}, b_{2}\\right)=(r, a)$, $\\left(a_{3}, b_{3}\\right), \\ldots$, with $a_{i} \\leq b_{i}$ and $a_{1}>a_{2}>a_{3}>\\cdots, b_{1}>b_{2}>b_{3}>\\cdots$, which of course is impossible. This shows that the ratio of $a^{2}+b^{2}+1$ to $a b+a+b$ cannot be greater than or equal to 3 , and so the answer to the problem consists of the pair $(1,1)$ together with all pairs of consecutive perfect squares.\\section{(Mathematics Magazine)}",

If $n=p q$ with $p, q$ primes and $p \\neq q$, then any cycle formed by $p, q, p q$ will have $p$ and $q$ next to each other.

First, we place $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{k}$ arranged clockwise around the circle in increasing order of their indices. Second, we place $p_{i} p_{i+1}$ between $p_{i}$ and $p_{i+1}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, k-1$. (Note that the text has $p_{i+i}$, which is a typo and lets $i$ go up to $k$, which is a problem if $k=2$, since $p_{1} p_{2}$ gets placed twice.) Third, we place $n$ between $p_{k}$ and $p_{1}$. Note that at this point every pair of consecutive numbers has a common factor and each prime $p_{i}$ occurs as a common factor for some pair of adjacent numbers. Now for any remaining divisor of $n$ we choose a prime $p_{i}$ that divides it and place it between $p_{i}$ and one of its neighbors.(USA Mathematical Olympiad, 2005, proposed by Z. Feng) ",

So let us consider a prime $p$ in $S, p>7$. Then $p-4$ can have no factor $q$ larger than 4 , for otherwise $p-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{p}{q}\\right\\rfloor q=4$. Since $p-4$ is odd, $p-4=3^{a}$ for some $a \\geq 2$. For a similar reason, $p-8$ cannot have prime factors larger than 8 , and so $p-8=3^{a}-4=5^{b} 7^{c}$.

By Fermat's little theorem,$$ a^{2} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 3), $$and since we must have $a^{k} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)$, it follows that $k$ is odd. Fermat's little theorem also gives$$ a^{36} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 37) . $$By hypothesis $a^{k} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 37)$. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $k x+36 y=\\operatorname{gcd}(k, 36)$. Since the $\\operatorname{gcd}(k, 36)$ is odd, $x$ is odd. We obtain that$$ a^{\\operatorname{gcd}(k, 36)} \\equiv a^{k x+36 y} \\equiv(-1) \\cdot 1=-1(\\bmod 37) . $$Since $\\operatorname{gcd}(k, 36)$ can be 1,3 , or 9 , we see that $a$ must satisfy $a \\equiv-1, a^{3} \\equiv-1$, or $a^{9} \\equiv-1$ modulo 37 . Thus $a$ is congruent to $-1$ modulo 3 and to $3,4,11,21,25,27,28$, 30 , or 36 modulo 37 . These residue classes modulo 37 are precisely those for which $a$ is a perfect square but not a perfect fourth power.

Letting $x=2 m$ and $z=2 n$, we obtain a Pythagorean equation$$ \\left(3^{m}\\right)^{2}+y^{2}=\\left(5^{n}\\right)^{2} . $$Because $y$ is even, in the usual parametrization of the solution we should have $3^{m}=$ $u^{2}-v^{2}$ and $5^{n}=u^{2}+v^{2}$.

The problem reduces to solving the Pythagorean equation $a^{2}+b^{2}=1997^{2}$ in positive integers. Since 1997 is prime, the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is 1 . Hence there exist coprime positive integers $u>v$ with the greatest common divisor equal to 1 such that$$ 1997=u^{2}+v^{2}, \\quad a=2 u v, \\quad b=u^{2}-v^{2} . $$Because $u$ is the larger of the two numbers, $\\frac{1997}{2}<u^{2}<1997$; hence $33 \\leq u \\leq 44$.

Hence$$ t^{2}(u-v)^{4}=\\frac{u^{3}-v^{3}}{u-v}=u^{2}+u v+v^{2}=(u-v)^{2}+3 u v $$or $(u-v)^{2}\\left[t^{2}(u-v)^{2}-1\\right]=3 u v$. It follows that $(u-v)^{2}$ divides $3 u v$, and since $u$ and $v$ are relatively prime and $u>v$, this can happen only if $u-v=1$. We obtain the equation $3 v(v+1)=t^{2}-1$, which is the same as$$ (v+1)^{3}-v^{3}=t^{2} $$This was solved in the previous problem.

Solving for $y$, we obtain$$ y=-\\frac{x^{2}+4006 x+2003^{2}}{3 x+4006} . $$To make the expression on the right easier to handle we multiply both sides by 9 and write$$ 9 y=-3 x-8012-\\frac{2003^{2}}{3 x+4006} . $$If $(x, y)$ is an integer solution to the given equation, then $3 x+4006$ divides $2003^{2}$.

        "Solution": "819. First solution: One can see immediately that $x=1$ is a solution. Assume that there exists a solution $x>1$. Then $x$ ! is even, so $3^{x !}$ has residue 1 modulo 4 . This implies that the last digit of the number $2^{3^{x !}}$ is 2 , so the last digit of $3^{2^{x !}}=2^{3^{x !}}+1$ is 3 . But this is impossible because the last digit of an even power of 3 is either 1 or 9 . Hence $x=1$ is the only solution.Second solution: We will prove by induction the inequality$$ 3^{2^{x !}}<2^{3^{x !}}, $$for $x \\geq 2$. The base case $x=2$ runs as follows: $3^{2^{2}}=3^{4}=81<512=2^{9}=2^{3^{2}}$. Assume now that $3^{2^{x !}}<2^{3^{x !}}$ and let us show that $3^{2^{(x+1) !}}<2^{3^{(x+1) !}}$.Raising the inequality $3^{2^{x !}}<2^{3 x^{x !}}$ to the power $2^{x ! \\cdot x}$, we obtain$$ \\left(3^{2^{x !}}\\right)^{2^{2 ! ! x}}<\\left(2^{3^{x !}}\\right)^{2^{x ! \\cdot x}}<\\left(2^{3^{x !}}\\right)^{3^{x ! \\cdot x}} . $$Therefore, $3^{2^{(x+1) !}}<2^{3^{(x+1) !}}$, and the inequality is proved.

But the level of this book restricts us to problems that use counting, classical schemes such as the Bernoulli and Poisson schemes and Bayes' theorem, recurrences, and some minor geometric considerations. It is only later in the development of mathematics that probability loses its combinatorial flavor and borrows the analytical tools of Lebesgue integration.",
        "Solution": "820. First solution: The solutions are$$ (v+1, v, 1,1), \\text { for all } v ; \\quad(2,1,1, y), \\text { for all } y ; \\quad(2,3,2,1),(3,2,2,3) . $$To show that these are the only solutions, we consider first the simpler case $v=$ $u+1$. Then $u^{x}-(u+1)^{y}=1$. Considering this equation modulo $u$, we obtain $-1 \\equiv u^{x}-(u+1)^{y}=1(\\bmod u)$. So $u=1$ or 2 . The case $u=1$ is clearly impossible, since then $v^{y}=0$, so we have $u=2, v=3$. We are left with the simpler equation $2^{x}-3^{y}=1$. Modulo 3 it follows that $x$ is even, $x=2 x^{\\prime}$. The equality $2^{2 x^{\\prime}}-1=\\left(2^{x^{\\prime}}-1\\right)\\left(2^{x^{\\prime}}+1\\right)=3^{y}$ can hold only if $x^{\\prime}=1$ (the only consecutive powers of 3 that differ by 2 are 1 and 3). So $x=2, y=1$, and we obtain the solution $(2,3,2,1)$.Now suppose that $u=v+1$. If $v=1$, then $u=2, x=1$, and $y$ is arbitrary. So we have found the solution $(2,1,2, y)$. If $v=2$, the equation reduces to $3^{x}-2^{y}=1$. If $y \\geq 2$, then modulo 4 we obtain that $x$ is even, $x=2 x^{\\prime}$, and so $3^{2 x^{\\prime}}-1=\\left(3^{x^{\\prime}}-1\\right)\\left(3^{x^{\\prime}}+\\right.$ 1) $=2^{y}$. Two consecutive powers of 2 differ by 2 if they are 2 and 4 . We find that either $x=y=1$ or $x=2, y=3$. This gives the solutions $(2,1,1,1)$ and $(3,2,2,3)$.So let us assume $v \\geq 3$. The case $y=1$ gives the solutions $(v+1, v, 1,1)$. If $y>1$, then $v^{2}$ divides $v^{y}$, so $1 \\equiv(v+1)^{x} \\equiv 0+\\left(\\begin{array}{l}x \\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right) v+1\\left(\\bmod v^{2}\\right)$, and therefore $v$ divides $x$. Considering the equation modulo $v+1$, we obtain $1 \\equiv(v+1)^{x}-v^{y} \\equiv$ $-(-1)^{y}(\\bmod (v+1))$. Since $v+1>2,1 \\not \\equiv-1(\\bmod (v+1))$, so $y$ must be odd. Now if $x=1$, then $v^{y}=v$, so $v=1$, giving again the family of solutions $(v+1, v, 1,1)$. So assume $x>1$. Then $(v+1)^{2}$ divides $(v+1)^{x}$, so$$ \\begin{aligned} 1 & \\equiv(v+1)^{x}-v^{y} \\equiv-(v+1-1)^{y} \\\\ & \\equiv 0-\\left(\\begin{array}{l} y \\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right)(v+1)(-1)^{y-1}-(-1)^{y} \\\\ & \\equiv-y(v+1)+1\\left(\\bmod (v+1)^{2}\\right) \\end{aligned} $$Hence $v+1$ divides $y$. Since $y$ is odd, $v+1$ is odd and $v$ is even. Since $v$ divides $x$, $x$ is also even. Because $v$ is even and $v \\geq 3$, it follows that $v \\geq 4$. We will need the following result.Lemma. If $a$ and $q$ are odd, if $1 \\leq m<t$, and if $a^{2^{m} q} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t}\\right)$, then $a \\equiv$ $\\pm 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m}\\right)$.Proof. First, let us prove the property for $q=1$. We will do it by induction on $m$. For $m=1$ we have $a^{2}=(a-1)(a+1)$, so one of the factors is divisible by $2^{t-1}$. Assume that the property is true for $m-1$ and let us prove it for $m$. Factoring, we obtain $\\left(a^{2^{m-1}}+1\\right)\\left(a^{2^{m-1}}-1\\right)$. For $m \\geq 2$, the first factor is 2 modulo 4 , hence $a^{2^{m-1}}$ is 1 modulo $2^{t-1}$. From the induction hypothesis it follows that $a \\equiv \\pm 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m}\\right)$ (note that $t-m=(t-1)-(m-1))$. For arbitrary $q$, from what we have proved so far it follows that $a^{q} \\equiv \\pm 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m}\\right)$. Because $\\phi\\left(2^{t-m}\\right)=2^{t-m-1}$, by Euler's theorem $a^{2^{t-m-1}} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m}\\right)$. Since $q$ is odd, we can find a positive integer $c$ such that $c q \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m-1}\\right)$. Then $a \\equiv a^{c q} \\equiv$ $(\\pm 1)^{c} \\equiv \\pm 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{t-m}\\right)$, and the lemma is proved.Let us return to the problem. Let $x=2^{m} q$, where $m \\geq 1$ and $q$ is odd. Because $(v+1)^{x}-v^{y}=1$, clearly $y \\geq x$. We have shown that $v+1$ divides $y$, so $y \\geq v+1$. Let us prove that $y \\geq 2 m+1$. Indeed, if $m \\leq 2$ this holds since $y \\geq v+1 \\geq 5 \\geq 2 m+1$; otherwise, $y \\geq x=2^{m} q \\geq 2^{m} \\geq 2 m+1$.Looking at the equation modulo $2^{y}$, we have $(v+1)^{2^{m} q} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{y}\\right)$, because $2^{y}$ divides $v^{y}$. By the lemma this implies that $v+1 \\equiv \\pm 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{y-m}\\right)$. But $v+1 \\equiv$ $1\\left(\\bmod 2^{y-m}\\right)$ would imply that $2^{m+1}$ divides $v$, which is impossible since $v$ divides $x$. Therefore, $v+1 \\equiv-1\\left(\\bmod 2^{y-m}\\right)$ and $v \\equiv-2\\left(\\bmod 2^{y-m}\\right)$. In particular, $v \\geq 2^{y-m}-2$, so $y \\geq 2^{y-m}-1$. But since $y \\geq 2 m+1$ and $y \\geq 5$, it follows that $2^{y-m}-1>y$, a contradiction. This shows that there are no other solutions.Second solution: Begin as before until we reduce to the case $u=v+1$ and $v \\geq 3$. Then we use the following lemma.Lemma. Suppose $p^{s} \\geq 3$ is a prime power, $r \\geq 1$, and $a \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{s}\\right)$, but not $\\bmod p^{s+1}$. If $a^{k} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{r+s}\\right)$, then $p^{r}$ divides $k$.Proof. Write $a=1+c p^{s}+d p^{s+1}$, where $1 \\leq c \\leq p-1$. Then we compute $a^{k} \\equiv$ $1+k c p^{s}\\left(\\bmod p^{s+1}\\right)$, and$$ a^{p}=1+c p^{s+1}+d p^{s+2}+\\left(\\begin{array}{l} p \\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right) p^{2 s}(c+d p)+\\left(\\begin{array}{l} p \\\\ 3 \\end{array}\\right) p^{3 s}(c+d p)^{3}+\\cdots . $$Since either $s \\geq 2$ or $p$ is odd, $p^{s+2}$ divides $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}p \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right) p^{2 s}$; hence the fourth term is zero $\\bmod p^{s+2}$. Since $s+2 \\leq 3 s$, the latter terms are also zero $\\bmod p^{s+2}$; hence $a^{p} \\equiv$ $1\\left(\\bmod p^{s+1}\\right)$, but not $\\bmod p^{s+2}$.We now proceed by induction on $r$. Since $r \\geq 1$, the first equation above shows that $p$ divides $k$, which is the base case. For the inductive step, we note that the second calculation above lets us apply the previous case to $\\left(a^{p}\\right)^{k \/ p}$.To use this lemma, let $p^{s} \\geq 3$ be the highest power of the prime $p$ that divides $v$. Then $u=v+1 \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{s}\\right)$, but not $\\bmod p^{s+1}$, and $u^{x}=v^{y}+1 \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{s y}\\right)$. Hence by the lemma, $p^{s(y-1)}$ divides $x$, and in particular, $x \\geq p^{s(y-1)} \\geq 3^{y-1}$. Thus either $x>y$ or $y=1$.Similarly, let $q^{t} \\geq 3$ be the highest power of the prime $q$ that divides $u$. Then $(-v)=1-u \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod q^{t}\\right)$, but not $\\bmod q^{t+1}$. Since $(-v)^{y} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod q^{t}\\right)$ and $(-v)^{y}=(-1)^{y}-(-1)^{y} u^{x} \\equiv(-1)^{y}\\left(\\bmod q^{t}\\right)$, we see that $y$ is even. Hence $(-v)^{y}=$ $1-u^{x} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod q^{t x}\\right)$. Thus by the lemma, $q^{t(x-1)}$ divides $y$, and in particular, $y \\geq$ $q^{t(x-1)} \\geq 3^{x-1}$, so either $y>x$ or $x=1$. Combining these, we see that we must have either $x=1$ or $y=1$. Either of these implies the other and gives the solution $(v+1, v, 1,1)$.Remark. Catalan conjectured in 1844 a more general fact, namely that the Diophantine equation $u^{x}-v^{y}=1$ subject to the condition $x, y \\geq 2$ has the unique solution $3^{2}-2^{3}=1$. This would mean that 8 and 9 are the only consecutive powers. Catalan's conjecture was proved by P. Mih\u0103ilescu in 2002.(Kvant (Quantum), first solution by R. Barton, second solution by R.

We obtain the recurrence relation$$ g(n)=g(n-1)+g(n-3), \\quad \\text { for } n \\geq 4 . $$In particular, the values of $g(n)$ modulo 3 are $1,1,1,2,0,1,0,0, \\ldots$ repeating with period 8.Now let $h(n)=f(n)-g(n)$. We see that $h(n)$ counts permutations of the desired form with $n$ occurring in the middle, sandwiched between $n-1$ and $n-2$. Removing $n$ leaves an acceptable permutation, and any acceptable permutation on $n-1$ symbols can be so produced, except those ending in $n-4, n-2, n-3, n-1$. So for $h(n)$, we have the recurrence$$ h(n)=h(n-1)+g(n-1)-g(n-4)=h(n-1)+g(n-2), \\quad \\text { for } n \\geq 5 . $$A routine check shows that $h(n)$ modulo 3 repeats with period 24.We find that $f(n)$ repeats with period equal to the least common multiple of 8 and 24 , which is 24 . Because $1996 \\equiv 4(\\bmod 24)$, we have $f(1996) \\equiv f(4)=4(\\bmod 3)$. So $f$ (1996) is not divisible by 3 .(Canadian Mathematical Olympiad, 1996)",

        "Solution": "835. Let $S=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2004\\}$. Write the permutation as a function $f: S \\rightarrow S$, $f(n)=a_{n}, n=1,2, \\ldots, 2004$. We start by noting three properties of $f$ :(i) $f(i) \\neq i$ for any $i$,(ii) $f(i) \\neq f(j)$ if $i \\neq j$,(iii) $f(i)=j$ implies $f(j)=i$. The first two properties are obvious, while the third requires a proof. Arguing by contradiction, let us assume that $f(i)=j$ but $f(j) \\neq i$. We discuss first the case $j>i$. If we let $k=j-i$, then $f(i)=i+k$. Since $k=|f(i)-i|=|f(j)-j|$ and $f(j) \\neq i$, it follows that $f(j)=i+2 k$, i.e., $f(i+k)=i+2 k$. The same reasoning yields $f(i+2 k)=i+k$ or $i+3 k$. Since we already have $f(i)=i+k$, the only possibility is $f(i+2 k)=i+3 k$. And the argument can be repeated to show that $f(i+n k)=i+(n+1) k$ for all $n$. However, this then forces $f$ to attain ever increasing values, which is impossible since its range is finite. A similar argument takes care of the case $j<i$. This proves (iii).The three properties show that $f$ is an involution on $S$ with no fixed points. Thus $f$ partitions $S$ into 1002 distinct pairs $(i, j)$ with $i=f(j)$ and $j=f(i)$. Moreover, the absolute value of the difference of the elements in any pair is the same. If $f(1)-1=k$ then $f(2)=k+1, \\ldots, f(k)=2 k$, and since $f$ is an involution, the values of $f$ on $k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 2 k$ are already determined, namely $f(k+1)=1, f(k+2)=$ $2, \\ldots, f(2 k)=k$. So the first block of $2 k$ integers is invariant under $f$. Using similar reasoning, we obtain $f(2 k+1)=3 k+1, f(2 k+2)=3 k+2, \\ldots, f(3 k)=4 k, f(3 k+$ $1)=2 k+1, \\ldots, f(4 k)=3 k$. So the next block of $2 k$ integers is invariant under $f$. Continuing this process, we see that $f$ partitions $S$ into blocks of $2 k$ consecutive integers that are invariant under $f$. This can happen only if $2 k$ divides 2004 , hence if $k$ divides 1002. Furthermore, for each such $k$ we can construct $f$ following the recipe given above. Hence the number of such permutations equals the number of divisors of 1002 , which is 8.(Australian Mathematical Olympiad, 2004, solution by L. Field)",

The answer to the problem is therefore $n=11$.\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2022_10_30_5df578bdac2dccbf98f1g-757.jpg?height=358&width=784&top_left_y=705&top_left_x=481)Figure 107Second solution: Suppose we have an example with $k$ dominoes to which no more can be added. Let $X$ be the number of pairs of an uncovered square and a domino that covers an adjacent square. Let $m=36-2 k$ be the number of uncovered squares, let $m_{\\partial}$ be the number of uncovered squares that touch the boundary (including corner squares), and $m_{c}$ the number of uncovered corner squares. Since any neighbor of an uncovered square must be covered by some domino, we have $X=4 m-m_{\\partial}-m_{c}$. Similarly, let $k_{\\partial}$ be the number of dominoes that touch the boundary and $k_{c}$ the number of dominoes that contain a corner square. A domino in the center of the board can have at most four unoccupied neighbors, for otherwise, we could place a new domino adjacent to it. Similarly, a domino that touches the boundary can have at most three unoccupied neighbors, and a domino that contains a corner square can have at most two unoccupied neighbors. Hence $X \\leq 4 k-k_{\\partial}-k_{c}$. Also, note that $k_{\\partial} \\geq m_{\\partial}$, since as we go around the boundary we can never encounter two unoccupied squares in a row, and $m_{c}+k_{c} \\leq 4$, since there are only four corners. Thus $4 m-m_{\\partial}-m_{c}=X \\leq 4 k-k_{\\partial}-k_{c}$ gives $4 m-4 \\leq 4 k$; hence $35-2 k \\leq k$ and $3 k \\geq 35$. Thus $k$ must be at least 12 . This argument also shows that on an $n \\times n$ board, $3 k^{2} \\geq n^{2}-1$.(T. Andreescu, Z. Feng, 102 Combinatorial Problems, Birkh\u00e4user, 2000, second solution by R. Stong)",

Thus if we sum the values of $G$ at the $p$ th roots of unity, only those terms with exponent divisible by $p$ will survive.

        "Solution": "878. We use the same generating functions as in the previous problem.

To $B_{n}$ we associate the function $b_{n}(x)$ in a similar manner. These functions satisfy the recurrence $a_{1}(x)=0, b_{1}(x)=1$,$$ \\begin{aligned} a_{n+1}(x) &=x b_{n}(x) \\\\ b_{n+1} & \\equiv a_{n}(x)+b_{n}(x)(\\bmod 2) \\end{aligned} $$From now on we understand all equalities modulo 2. Let us restrict our attention to the sequence of functions $b_{n}(x), n=1,2, \\ldots$ It satisfies $b_{1}(x)=b_{2}(x)=1$,$$ b_{n+1}(x)=b_{n}(x)+x b_{n-1}(x) $$We solve this recurrence the way one usually solves second-order recurrences, namely by finding two linearly independent solutions $p_{1}(x)$ and $p_{2}(x)$ satisfying$$ p_{i}(x)^{n+1}=p_{i}(x)^{n}+x p_{i}(x)^{n-1}, \\quad i=1,2 . $$Again the equality is to be understood modulo 2. The solutions $p_{1}(x)$ and $p_{2}(x)$ are formal power series whose coefficients are residue classes modulo 2 . They satisfy the \"characteristic\" equation$$ p(x)^{2}=p(x)+x $$which can be rewritten as$$ p(x)(p(x)+1)=x $$So $p_{1}(x)$ and $p_{2}(x)$ can be chosen as the factors of this product, and thus we may assume that $p_{1}(x)=x h(x)$ and $p_{2}(x)=1+p_{1}(x)$, where $h(x)$ is again a formal power series. Writing $p_{1}(x)=\\sum \\alpha_{a} x^{a}$ and substituting in the characteristic equation, we find that $\\alpha_{1}=1, \\alpha_{2 k}=\\alpha_{k}^{2}$, and $\\alpha_{2 k+1}=0$ for $k>1$. Therefore,$$ p_{1}(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{2^{k}} $$Since $p_{1}(x)+p_{2}(x)=p_{1}(x)^{2}+p_{2}(x)^{2}=1$, it follows that in general,$$ b_{n}(x)=p_{1}(x)^{n}+p_{2}(x)^{n}=\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{2^{k}}\\right)^{n}+\\left(1+\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{2^{k}}\\right)^{n}, \\quad \\text { for } n \\geq 1 . $$We emphasize again that this is to be considered modulo 2. In order for $b_{n}(x)$ to be identically equal to 1 modulo 2 , we should have$$ \\left(\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{2^{k}}\\right)+1\\right)^{n} \\equiv\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} x^{2^{k}}\\right)^{n}+1(\\bmod 2) . $$This obviously happens if $n$ is a power of 2 , since all binomial coefficients in the expansion are even.If $n$ is not a power of 2 , say $n=2^{i}(2 j+1), j \\geq 1$, then the smallest $m$ for which $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ m\\end{array}\\right)$ is odd is $2^{j}$. The left-hand side will contain an $x^{2^{j}}$ with coefficient equal to 1 , while the smallest nonzero power of $x$ on the right is $n$. Hence in this case equality cannot hold.We conclude that $B_{n}=\\{0\\}$ if and only if $n$ is a power of 2 .(Chinese Mathematical Olympiad)",

This is exactly the number of lines determined by two points, and we will use these lines to count the number of partitions.

There are $2\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ such lines, obtained by pushing the lines through the $n$ points to one side or the other. However, each partition is counted at least twice this way, except for the partitions that come from the sides of the polygon that is the convex hull of the $n$ points, but those can be paired with the partitions that cut out one vertex of the convex hull from the others.

So after $n$ cuts there are at most $4 n+4$ vertices.Assume now that after $N$ cuts we have obtained the one hundred polygons with 20 sides. Since altogether there are $N+1$ pieces, besides the one hundred polygons there are $N+1-100$ other pieces. Each of these other pieces has at least 3 vertices, so the total number of vertices is $100 \\cdot 20+(N-99) \\cdot 3$. This number does not exceed $4 N+4$.

        "Solution": "902. If the $m$-gon has three acute angles, say at vertices $A, B, C$, then with a fourth vertex $D$ they form a cyclic quadrilateral $A B C D$ that has three acute angles, which is impossible. Similarly, if the $m$-gon has two acute angles that do not share a side, say at vertices $A$ and $C$, then they form with two other vertices $B$ and $D$ of the $m$-gon a cyclic quadrilateral $A B C D$ that has two opposite acute angles, which again is impossible. Therefore, the $m$-gon has either exactly one acute angle, or has two acute angles and they share a side.To count the number of such $m$-gons we employ the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Thus we first find the number of $m$-gons with at least one acute angle, then subtract the number of $m$-gons with two acute angles (which were counted twice the first time). If the acute angle of the $m$-gon is $A_{k} A_{1} A_{k+r}$, the condition that this angle is acute translates into $r \\leq n$.

        "Solution": "905. We solve the problem for the general case of a rectangular solid of width $w$, length $l$, and height $h$, where $w, l$, and $h$ are positive integers. Orient the solid in space so that one vertex is at $O=(0,0,0)$ and the opposite vertex is at $A=(w, l, h)$. Then $O A$ is the diagonal of the solid.The diagonal is transversal to the planes determined by the faces of the small cubes, so each time it meets a face, edge, or vertex, it leaves the interior of one cube and enters the interior of another. Counting by the number of interiors of small cubes that the diagonal leaves, we find that the number of interiors that $O A$ intersects is equal to the number of points on $O A$ having at least one integer coordinate. We count these points using the inclusion-exclusion principle. The first coordinate of the current point $P=(t w, t l, t h), 0<t \\leq 1$, on the diagonal is a positive integer for exactly $w$ values of $t$, namely, $t=\\frac{1}{w}, \\frac{2}{2}, \\ldots, \\frac{w}{w}$. The second coordinate is an integer for $l$ values of $t$, and the third coordinate is an integer for $h$ values of $t$.

        "Solution": "911. Consider the dual cube to the octahedron. The vertices $A, B, C, D, E, F, G$, $H$ of this cube are the centers of the faces of the octahedron (here $A B C D$ is a face of the cube and $(A, G),(B, H),(C, E),(D, F)$ are pairs of diagonally opposite vertices). Each assignment of the numbers $1,2,3,4,5,6,7$, and 8 to the faces of the octahedron corresponds to a permutation of $A B C D E F G H$, and thus to an octagonal circuit of these vertices. The cube has 16 diagonal segments that join nonadjacent vertices. The problem requires us to count octagonal circuits that can be formed by eight of these diagonals.Six of these diagonals are edges of the tetrahedron $A C F H$, six are edges of the tetrahedron $D B E G$, and four are long diagonals, joining opposite vertices of the cube. Notice that each vertex belongs to exactly one long diagonal. It follows that an octagonal circuit must contain either 2 long diagonals separated by 3 tetrahedron edges (Figure 108a), or 4 long diagonals (Figure 108b) alternating with tetrahedron edges.\n![](https:\/\/cdn.mathpix.com\/cropped\/2022_10_30_5df578bdac2dccbf98f1g-783.jpg?height=330&width=820&top_left_y=872&top_left_x=462)Figure 108When forming a (skew) octagon with 4 long diagonals, the four tetrahedron edges need to be disjoint; hence two are opposite edges of $A C F H$ and two are opposite edges of $D B E G$. For each of the three ways to choose a pair of opposite edges from the tetrahedron $A C F H$, there are two possible ways to choose a pair of opposite edges from tetrahedron $D B E G$. There are $3 \\cdot 2=6$ octagons of this type, and for each of them, a circuit can start at 8 possible vertices and can be traced in two different ways, making a total of $6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2=96$ permutations.An octagon that contains exactly two long diagonals must also contain a three-edge path along the tetrahedron $A C F H$ and a three-edge path along tetrahedron the $D B E G$. A three-edge path along the tetrahedron the $A C F H$ can be chosen in $4 !=24$ ways. The corresponding three-edge path along the tetrahedron $D B E G$ has predetermined initial and terminal vertices; it thus can be chosen in only 2 ways. Since this counting method treats each path as different from its reverse, there are $8 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 2=384$ permutations of this type.In all, there are $96+384=480$ permutations that correspond to octagonal circuits formed exclusively from cube diagonals.

Clearly, $P(0)=0$ and $P(N)=1$. We want a recurrence relation for $P(m)$.Assume that $A$ starts with $k$ dollars. During the first game, $A$ can win, lose, or the game can be a draw.

Finally, if the first game is a draw, nothing changes, so the probability of $A$ winning in the end remains equal to $P(k)$.

        "Solution": "931. We assume that the circle of the problem is the unit circle centered at the origin $O$. The space of all possible choices of three points $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}$ is the product of three circles; the volume of this space is $2 \\pi \\times 2 \\pi \\times 2 \\pi=8 \\pi^{3}$. Let us first measure the volume of the configurations $\\left(P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}\\right)$ such that the arc $P_{1} \\widehat{P_{2}} P_{3}$ is included in a semicircle and is oriented counterclockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$. The condition that the arc is contained in a semicircle translates to $0 \\leq \\angle P_{1} O P_{2} \\leq \\pi$ and $0 \\leq \\angle P_{2} O P_{3} \\leq \\pi-\\angle P_{1} O P_{2}$ (see Figure 111). The point $P_{1}$ is chosen randomly on the circle, and for each $P_{1}$ the region of the angles $\\theta_{1}$ and $\\theta_{2}$ such that $0 \\leq \\theta_{1} \\leq \\pi$ and $0 \\leq \\theta_{1} \\leq \\pi-\\theta_{1}$ is an isosceles right triangle with leg equal to $\\pi$.

        "Problem Statement": "932. Let $n \\geq 4$ be given, and suppose that the points $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}$ are randomly chosen on a circle. Consider the convex $n$-gon whose vertices are these points. What is the probability that at least one of the vertex angles of this polygon is acute?",
        "Solution": "932. The angle at the vertex $P_{i}$ is acute if and only if all other points lie on an open semicircle facing $P_{i}$. We first deduce from this that if there are any two acute angles at all, they must occur consecutively. Otherwise, the two arcs that these angles subtend would overlap and cover the whole circle, and the sum of the measures of the two angles would exceed $180^{\\circ}$.So the polygon has either just one acute angle or two consecutive acute angles. In particular, taken in counterclockwise order, there exists exactly one pair of consecutive angles the second of which is acute and the first of which is not.We are left with the computation of the probability that for one of the points $P_{j}$, the angle at $P_{j}$ is not acute, but the following angle is. This can be done using integrals. But there is a clever argument that reduces the geometric probability to a probability with a finite number of outcomes. The idea is to choose randomly $n-1$ pairs of antipodal points, and then among these to choose the vertices of the polygon. A polygon with one vertex at $P_{j}$ and the other among these points has the desired property exactly when $n-2$ vertices lie on the semicircle to the clockwise side of $P_{j}$ and one vertex on the opposite semicircle. Moreover, the points on the semicircle should include the counterclockwisemost to guarantee that the angle at $P_{j}$ is not acute. Hence there are $n-2$ favorable choices of the total $2^{n-1}$ choices of points from the antipodal pairs. The probability for obtaining a polygon with the desired property is therefore $(n-2) 2^{-n+1}$.Integrating over all choices of pairs of antipodal points preserves the ratio. The events $j=1,2, \\ldots, n$ are independent, so the probability has to be multiplied by $n$. The answer to the problem is therefore $n(n-2) 2^{-n+1}$.(66th W.L.

        "Solution": "934. Mark an endpoint of the needle. Translations parallel to the given (horizontal) lines can be ignored; thus we can assume that the marked endpoint of the needle always falls on the same vertical. Its position is determined by the variables $(x, \\theta)$, where $x$ is the distance to the line right above and $\\theta$ the angle made with the horizontal (Figure 113).The pair $(x, \\theta)$ is randomly chosen from the region $[0,2) \\times[0,2 \\pi)$.
