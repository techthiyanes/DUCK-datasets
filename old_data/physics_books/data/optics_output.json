A discharge tube produces light of wavelength $\\lambda$ which passes through a small slit $S$ immediately in front of the tube. The centers of the two slits of width $w$ are at distance $D$ apart. Find the condition that a maximum intensity be observed at the screen a distance $l$ from the central plane. Assume that $D \\ll L, l \\ll L$, and that $w$ is very small. How large may $w$ be before the interference pattern is washed out? As $w$ increases, do the maxima and minima wash out first near the midplane or further away?

        "Solution": "Place two P-type sheets together such that the first sheet has its $\\hat{n}$ axis at $45^{\\circ}$ to the $\\hat{x}$ axis and the second has its $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ axis at $90^{\\circ}$ to the $\\hat{x}$ axis. The combined sheet will convert an incident light polarized parallel to $\\hat{*}$ into an outgoing light polarized perpendicular to $\\hat{x}$. The outgoing intensity is reduced to $I_{0} \\cos ^{4} 45^{\\circ}=I_{0} / 4$, where $I_{0}$ is the incident intensity, according to the law of Malus.Combine a polariser (A side) and a $\\frac{\\lambda}{4}$ wave plate (B side) so that the axe $\\mathrm{h}$ and $\\mathbf{m}$ are orientated at $45^{\\circ}$ to each other. The combined sheet will convert unpolarised light into circularly polarised light. The outgoing intensity is reduced to $I_{0} / 2$ if absorption by the $\\frac{\\lambda}{4}$ wave plate is negligible.The angular momentum $J$ and energy $W$ of a circularly polarised light are related by $J=W \\omega^{-1}$, where $\\omega=2 \\pi \\nu, \\nu$ being the frequency of the light. The torque on the circular polarizer is\n\n$$\n\\tau=\\frac{d J}{d t}=\\omega^{-1} \\frac{d W}{d t}=\\frac{1}{2} I_{0} \\omega^{-1}=\\frac{I_{0} \\lambda}{4 \\pi c},\n$$\n\nsince only $I_{0} / 2$ goes into the circularly polarised light.The circularly polarised light is reflected back through the $\\frac{\\lambda}{4}$ wave plate; the result is a plane polarised light, polarised at right angle to the transmission axis of the polarizer (A side). Therefore, no light is transmitted backwards through the combination.The intensity of the transmitted light is\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{1}{2} I_{0} \\cos ^{2} \\theta .\n$$The intensity of the transmitted light is\n\n$$\nI=\\frac{1}{2} I_{0} \\sin ^{2} \\theta .\n$$",

The ultra-short pulses are produced by mode-locking a laser - a method to be studied in this problem. The model laser consists of an optical cavity of length $L$ with transverse dimensions $d$ formed by two flat mirrors as shown in Fig. 3.7.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-172.jpg?height=209&width=843&top_left_y=1478&top_left_x=345)\n\nFig. 3.7\n\nThe amplifying medium (it may be solid, liquid, or gas) can be characterized by a certain gain spectrum (Fig. 3.8); only light within this band of frequencies will be amplified. To simplify calculation, assume the gain spectrum is rectangular as shown in Fig. 3.9.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-173.jpg?height=292&width=383&top_left_y=330&top_left_x=309)\n\nFig. $3.8$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-173.jpg?height=288&width=383&top_left_y=334&top_left_x=773)\n\nFig. $3.9$\n\nTo be specific, consider the amplifying medium Nd glass, which has $\\omega_{0}=1.8 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}, \\Delta \\omega=6 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$, and take the length of the laser to be $L=150 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nBy inserting a modulated absorber into the cavity, one can lock the phases of all the modes to the same value, so that traveling waves interfere constructively, producing light pulses. Find the intensity as a function of time in this phase-locked or mode-locked case. What is the pulse duration, pulse separation, and peak intensity (in terms of $I_{0}$ )? Consider only one polarisation.\n\n(It is irrelevant for this problem, but for your information, a modulated absorber has an effective absorption that is a function of time - e.g., $\\alpha=\\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{2} \\cos (\\omega t)$. Any cavity mode with the wrong phase relative to this modulation experiences excess attenuation, so only phase-locked modes are amplified.)",
