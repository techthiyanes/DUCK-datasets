\section{PREFACE}

This series of physics problems and solutions, which consists of seven parts - Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Optics, Atomic, Nuclear and Particle Physics, Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics, Quantum Mechanics, Solid State Physics - contains a selection of 2550 problems from the graduate school entrance and qualifying examination papers of seven U.S. universities - California University Berkeley Campus, Columbia University, Chicago University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York State University Buffalo Campus, Princeton University, Wisconsin University as well as the CUSPEA and C. C. Ting's papers for selection of Chinese students for further studies in U.S.A. and their solutions which represent the effort of more than 70 Chinese physicists.

The series is remarkable for its comprehensive coverage. In each area the problems span a wide spectrum of topics while many problems overlap several areas. The problems themselves are remarkable for their versatility in applying the physical laws and principles, their uptodate realistic situations, and their acanty demand on mathematical skills. Many of the problems involve order of magnitude calculations which one often requires in an experimental situation for estimating a quantity from a simple model. In short, the exercises blend together the objectives of enhancement of one's underat anding of the physical principles and practical applicability.

The solutions as presented generally just provide a guidance to solving the probelms rather than step by step manipulation and leave much to the student to work out for him/herself, of whom much is demanded of the basic knowledge in physics. Thus the series would provide an invaluable complement to the textbooks.

In editing no attempt has been made to unify the physical terms and symbols. Rather, they are left to the setters' and solvers' own preference so as to reflect the realistic situation of the usage today. The present volume for Optics consists of three parts: Geometrical Optics, Physical Optics, Quantum Optics, and comprises 160 problems.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Solving problems in school work is the exercise of mental faculties, and examination problems are usually the pick of the problems in school work. Working out problems is a necessary and important aspect of the learning of Physics.

The American University Ph. D. Qualifying Questions and Solutions is a series of seven volumes. The subjects of the volumes and their respective referees (in parentheses) are as follows:

1. Mechanics (Qiang Yuan-qi, Gu En-pu, Cheng Jia-fu, Li Ze-hua, Yang De-tian)

2. Electromagnetism (Zhao Shu-ping, You Jun-han, Zhu Jun-jie)

3. Optics (Bai Gui-ru, Guo Guang-can)

4. Atomic, Nuclear and Particle Physics (Jin Huai-cheng, Yang Baoshong, Fan Yang-mei)

5. Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics (Zheng Jiu-ren)

6. Quantum Mechanics (Zhang Yong-de, Zhu Dong-pei, Fan Hong-yi)

7. Solid State Physics and Comprehensive Topics (Zhang Jia-l≈©, Zhou You-yuan, Zhang Shi-ling)

These books cover almost all aspects of university physics and contain 2550 problems, most of which are solved in detail.

These problems have been carefully chosen from a collection of 3100 problems some of which came from the China-U.S.A. Physics Examination and Application Programme and Ph.D. Qualifying Examination on Experimental High Energy Physics sponsored by Chao Chong Ting, while the other from the graduate preliminary or qualifying examination questions of the following seven top American universities during the last decade: Columbia University, University of California at Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Wisconsin, University of Chicago, Princeton University, State University of New York at Buffalo.

In general, examination problems on physics in American universities do not involve too much mathematics. Rather, they can be categorized into the following three types. Many of the problems that involve the various frontier subjects and overlapping domains of science have been selected by the professors directly from their own research and show a "modern style". Some of the problems involve a wide field and require a quick mind to analyse, while the others are often simple to solve but are practical and require a full "touch of physics." We think it reasonable to take these problems as a reflection, to some extent, of the characteristics of American science and culture, as well as the tenet of American education.

This being so, we believe it worthwhile to collect and solve these problems and then introduce them to the students and teachers, even though the effort involved is formidable. Nearly a hundred teachers and graduate students took part in this time-consuming task.

There are 160 problems in this volume, which is divided into three parts: part I consists of 41 problems in geometric optics, part II consists of 89 problems in wave optics, part III consists of 30 problems in quantum optics.

The depth of knowledge involved in solving these problems is not beyond the contents of common textbooks on optics used in colleges and universities in China, although the scope of the knowledge and techniques needed in solving some of the problems go beyond what we are usually familiar with. Furthermore, some new scientific research results (e.g. some newly developed lasers) are introduced in the problems. This will not only enhance the understanding of the established theories and knowledge, but also encourage the interaction between teaching and research which cannot but enliven academic thoughts and excite the mind.

The physicists who contributed to solving the problems in this volume are Shi De-xiu, Yao Kun, Lu Hong-jun, Chen Xiang-li, Gu Chun, Han Wenhai and Wu Zhi-qiang. The initial translation from Chinese into English was carried out by Xuan Zhi-hua. Some revisions have been made in this English edition bv the combilers. the translator and the editor.

\section{2}

A horizontal ray of light passes through a prism of index $1.50$ and apex angle $4^{\circ}$ and then strikes a vertical mirror, as shown in the figure. Through what angle must the mirror be rotated if after reflection the ray is to be horisontal?

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $1.1$

\section{Solution:}

As the apex angle is very small $\left(\alpha=4^{\circ}\right)$, the angle of deviation $\delta$ can be obtained approximately:

$$
\delta=(n-1) \alpha=(1.5-1) \times 4^{\circ}=2^{\circ} .
$$

From Fig. $1.2$ we see that if the reflected ray is to be horizontal, the mirror must be rotated clockwise through an angle $\gamma$ given by

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{2}=1^{\circ} \text {. }
$$

Fig. $1.2$

\section{8}

A narrow beam of light is incident on a $30^{\circ}-60^{\circ}-90^{\circ}$ prism as shown (Fig. 1.3). The index of refraction of the prism is $n=2.1$. Show that the entire beam emerges either from the right-hand face, or back along the incident path.

(Wisconsin)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-016.jpg?height=303&width=319&top_left_y=1043&top_left_x=260)

Fig. $1.3$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-016.jpg?height=223&width=415&top_left_y=1093&top_left_x=842)

Fig. $1.4$

\section{Solution:}

As seen from Fig. 1.4, for normal incidence at the bottom face the angle of incidence at $B$ is $30^{\circ}$, and that at $C$ is $60^{\circ}$, both of which are larger than the critical angle of the prism,

$$
\theta_{c}=\sin ^{-1} \frac{1}{n}=28^{\circ} 26^{\prime} .
$$

Hence the ray is totally reflected at $B$ and C. Also, the ray is partially reflected back at the bottom and the right-hand faces. Therefore, the entire beam emerges either from the right-hand face, or back along the incident path. 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-017.jpg?height=289&width=202&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=609)

Fig. $1.5$

A glass cube has a refractive index of 1.5. A light beam enters the top face obliquely and then strikes the side of the cube. Does light emerge from this side? Explain your answer.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

Assume that the angles of incidence and refraction at the top face are $i_{1}$ and $i_{1}^{\prime}$ respectively. According to Snell's law of refraction,

$$
\sin i_{1}=n \sin i_{1}^{\prime} \text {. }
$$

From the geometry (see Fig. 1.5) $i_{1}^{\prime}+i_{2}=90^{\circ}$, where $i_{2}$ is the angle of incidence at the right side. Thus, we have

$$
\sin i_{1}=n \cos i_{2},
$$

or

$$
i_{2}=\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin i_{1}}{n}\right) \text {. }
$$

When $i_{1}=90^{\circ}, i_{2}$ has the minimum value

$$
i_{2}=\cos ^{-1} \frac{1}{1.5}=48^{\circ} 10^{\prime}>i_{c}=42^{\circ} \text { (critical angle). }
$$

\section{Hence no light emerges from this side.}

\section{5}

A glass rod of rectangular cross-section is bent into the shape shown in the Fig. 1.6. A parallel beam of light falls perpendicularly on the flat surface $A$. Determine the minimum value of the ratio $R / d$ for which all light entering the glass through surface $A$ will emerge from the glass through surface B. The index of refraction of the glass is $1.5$.

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $1.6$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-018.jpg?height=419&width=402&top_left_y=209&top_left_x=757)

Fig. $1.7$

\section{Solution:}

Consider the representative rays shown in Fig. 1.7. A ray entering the glass through surface $A$ and passing along the inner side of the rod will be reflected by the outer side with the smallest angle $\alpha$, at which the reflected ray is tangent to the inner side. We have to consider the conditions under which the ray will undergo total internal reflection before reaching $B$.

If $\alpha>\theta_{c}$, the critical angle, at which total internal reflection occurs, all the incident beam will emerge through the surface B. Hence we require

$$
\sin \alpha>\frac{1}{n} .
$$

The geometry gives

$$
\sin \alpha=\frac{R}{(R+d)} .
$$

Therefore

$$
\frac{R}{R+d} \geq \frac{1}{n},
$$

or

$$
\left(\frac{R}{d}\right)_{\min }=\frac{1}{n-1}=\frac{1}{1.5-1}=2 .
$$

\section{6}

A small fish, four feet below the surface of Lake Mendota is viewed through a simple thin converging lens with focal length 30 feet. If the lens is 2 feet above the water surface (Fig. 1.8), where is the image of the fish seen by the observer? Assume the fish lies on the optical axis of the lens and that $n_{\text {air }}=1.0, n_{\text {water }}=1.33$.

(Wisconsin)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-019.jpg?height=194&width=412&top_left_y=439&top_left_x=262)

Fig. $1.8$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-019.jpg?height=371&width=252&top_left_y=348&top_left_x=900)

Fig. $1.8$

\section{Solution:}

An object at $P$ in water appears to be at $P^{\prime}$ as seen by an observer in air, as Fig. $1.9$ shows. The paraxial light emitted by $P$ is refracted at the water surface, for which

$$
1.33 \sin i_{1}=\sin i_{2} .
$$

As $i_{1}, i_{2}$ are very small, we have the approximation $1.33 i_{1}=i_{2}$. Also,

$$
i_{2}=\alpha \approx \frac{\overline{\mathrm{OQ}}}{\overline{\mathrm{OP}^{\prime}}}, \quad i_{1}=\beta \approx \frac{\overline{\mathrm{OQ}}}{\overline{\mathrm{QP}}} .
$$

Hence, we have

$$
\overline{\mathrm{OP}^{\prime}}=\frac{1}{1.33} \cdot \overline{\mathrm{OP}}=3 \mathrm{ft} .
$$

Let the distance between the apparent location of the fish and the center of the lens be $u$, then

$$
u=2+\overline{O P^{\prime}}=5 \mathrm{ft} .
$$

From $\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}$, we have

$$
v=-6 \mathrm{ft} \text {. }
$$

Therefore, the image of the fish is still where the fish is, four feet below the 

\section{7}

The index of refraction of glass can be increased by diffusing in impurities. It is then possible to make a lens of constant thickness. Given a disk of radius $a$ and thickness $d$, find the radial variation of the index of refraction $n(r)$ which will produce a lens with focal length $F$. You may assume a thin lens $(d \ll a)$.

(Chicago)

\section{Solution:}

Let the refractive index of the material of the disk be $n$ and the radial distribution of the refractive index of the impurity-diffused disk be represented by $n(r)$, with $n(0)=n_{0}$. Incident plane waves entering the lens refract and converge at the focus $F$ as shown in Fig. 1.10. We have

$$
\left|n(r)-n_{0}\right| d=-\sqrt{F^{2}+r^{2}}+F,
$$

i.e.,

$$
n(r)=n_{0}-\frac{\sqrt{F^{2}+r^{2}}-F}{d} .
$$

For $F>r$, we obtain

$$
n(r)=n_{0}-\frac{r^{2}}{2 d F} .
$$

Fig. $1.10$

\section{8}

The index of refraction of air at $300 \mathrm{~K}$ and 1 atmosphere pressure is $1.0003$ in the middle of the visible spectrum. Assuming an isothermal atmosphere at $300 \mathrm{~K}$, calculate by what factor the earth's atmosphere would have to be more dense to cause light to bend around the earth with the earth's curvature at sea level. (In cloudless skies we could then watch sunset all night, in principle, but with an image of the sun drastically compressed vertically.) You may assume that the index of refraction $n$ has the property that $n-1$ is proportional to the density. (Hint: Think of Fermat's Principle.) The 1/e height of this isothermal atmosphere is 8700 metres.

(UC, Berkeley)

\section{Solution:}

We are given that

$$
n(r)-1=\rho e^{-\frac{r-f}{s} r b},
$$

where $R=6400 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~m}$ is the earth's radius and $\rho$ is the density coefficient of air. Then

$$
\begin{gathered}
n(r)=1+\rho e^{-\frac{5 \pi}{500}}, \\
\frac{d n(r)}{d r}=n^{\prime}(r)=-\frac{1}{8700} \rho e^{-\frac{5-8}{500}} .
\end{gathered}
$$

It is also given that air is so dense that it makes light bend around the earth with the earth's curvature at sea level, as shown in Fig. 1.11.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-021.jpg?height=264&width=270&top_left_y=879&top_left_x=571)

Fig. $1.11$

The optical path length from $A$ to $B$ is

$$
l=n(r) r \theta .
$$

\section{According to Fermat's Principle, the optical path length from A to B should be an extremum. Therefore,}

$$
\frac{d l}{d r}=\left[n^{\prime}(r) r+n(r)\right] \theta=0,
$$

i.e.,

$$
n^{\prime}(r)=\frac{-n(r)}{r} .
$$

\section{Substituting (3) into (2) yields}

$$
\frac{1}{8700} \rho e^{-\frac{r-\pi}{800}}=\frac{n(r)}{r} .
$$

At sea level, $r=R=6400 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~m}$. This with (1) and (4) yields

$$
\frac{\rho \times 6400 \times 10^{3}}{8700}=1+\rho
$$

giving

$$
\rho=0.00136 .
$$

At sea level, i.e., at $300 \mathrm{~K}$ and 1 atmosphere pressure, $n_{0}-1=\rho_{0}=0.0003$. Therefore

$$
\frac{\rho}{\rho_{0}}=4.53 .
$$

Thus only if the air were $4.53$ times as dense as the real air would light bend around the earth with the earth's curvature at sea level.

Incident parallel rays make an angle of $5^{\circ}$ with the axis of a diverging lens $-20 \mathrm{~cm}$ in focal length. Locate the image.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

$20 \times \tan 5^{\circ}=1.75 \mathrm{~cm}$. The image is a virtual point image in the focal plane $1.75 \mathrm{~cm}$ off the optical axis.

\section{0}

A thin lens with index of refraction $n$ and radii of curvature $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ is located between 2 media with indices of refraction $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ as shown (Fig. 1.12). If $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are the object and image distances respectively, and $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ the respective focal lengths, show that

$$
\frac{f_{1}}{S_{1}}+\frac{f_{2}}{S_{2}}=1 \text {. }
$$



![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-023.jpg?height=320&width=387&top_left_y=215&top_left_x=157)

Fig. $1.12$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-023.jpg?height=300&width=634&top_left_y=188&top_left_x=604)

Fig. $1.13$

\section{Solution:}

First we study the relation between $f_{1}, f_{2}$ and $R_{1}, R_{2}, n_{1}, n_{2}, n$. As Fig. $1.13$ shows, a ray parallel to the axis is refracted at $Q$ and crosses the axis at the second focal point $F_{2} ;$ a ray along the axis passes through $F_{2}$ also. As the optical lengths of the two rays are equal, we have

$$
n_{1} \overline{\mathrm{P}_{1}^{\prime} \bar{Q}}+n_{2} \overline{\mathrm{QF}_{2}}=n \overline{\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{P}_{2}}+n_{2} \overline{\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{~F}_{2}} \text {. }
$$

As $\overline{\mathrm{QO}_{2}}=\overline{\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{O}_{2}}=R_{1}$, we have

$$
\overline{\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{O}}=R_{1}-\overline{\mathrm{OO}_{2}}=R_{1}-\sqrt{R_{1}^{2}-h^{2}} \approx \frac{h^{2}}{2 R_{1}},\left(\frac{h}{R_{1}}<1\right) \text {. }
$$

In the same way, we have

$$
\overline{\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}} \approx \frac{h^{2}}{2 R_{2}} .
$$

Hence $\overline{\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{P}_{2}}=\frac{h^{2}}{2}\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right) \cdot \mathrm{As} \overline{\mathrm{P}_{1}^{\prime} \mathrm{Q}}=\overline{\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{O}}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \overline{\overline{Q F}_{2}}=\left(h^{2}+f_{2}^{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \approx f_{2}\left(1+\frac{h^{2}}{2 f_{2}^{2}}\right) \text {, } \\
& \overline{\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{~F}_{2}}=f_{2}-\overline{\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{O}}=f_{2}-\frac{h^{2}}{2 R_{2}} \text {, }
\end{aligned}
$$

\section{substituting into (1) yields}

$$
\frac{n_{2}}{f_{2}}=\frac{n-n_{1}}{R_{1}}+\frac{n-n_{2}}{R_{2}} .
$$

\section{Similarly we obtain}

$$
\frac{n_{1}}{f_{1}}=\frac{n-n_{1}}{R_{1}}+\frac{n-n_{2}}{R_{2}} .
$$

Let $A$ and $A^{\prime}$ be a pair of conjugate points. We have

$$
\begin{gathered}
\overline{\mathrm{AQ}}=\left(h^{2}+S_{1}^{2}\right)^{1 / 2} \approx S_{1}\left(1+\frac{h^{2}}{2 S_{1}^{2}}\right), \overline{\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{Q}}=S_{2}\left(1+\frac{h^{2}}{2 S_{2}^{2}}\right), \\
\overline{\mathrm{AP}_{1}}=S_{1}-\overline{\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{O}}=S_{1}-\frac{h^{2}}{2 R_{1}}, \overline{\mathrm{AP}_{2}}=S_{2}-\frac{h^{2}}{2 R_{2}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Substituting these in the optical path equation

$$
n_{1} \overline{\mathrm{AQ}}+n_{2} \overline{\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{Q}}=n_{1} \overline{\mathrm{AP}}+n \overline{\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{P}_{2}}+n_{2} \overline{\mathrm{A}^{\prime} \mathrm{P}_{2}}
$$

yields

$$
\frac{n_{1}}{S_{1}}+\frac{n_{2}}{S_{2}}=\frac{n-n_{1}}{R_{1}}+\frac{n-n_{2}}{R_{2}} .
$$

Combining $(2),(3)$ and (4) yields

$$
\frac{f_{1}}{S_{1}}+\frac{f_{2}}{S_{2}}=1 .
$$

\section{1}

A line object $5 \mathrm{~mm}$ long is located $50 \mathrm{~cm}$ in front of a camera lens. The image is focussed on the film plate and is $1 \mathrm{~mm}$ long. If the film plate is moved back $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ the width of the image blurs to $1 \mathrm{~mm}$ wide. What is the $F$-number of the lens?

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

Substituting $u=50 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $\frac{y}{u}=\frac{1}{5}$ in the Gaussian lens formula

$$
\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{f}
$$

gives $f=8.33 \mathrm{~cm}, v=10 \mathrm{~cm}$. From the similar triangles in Fig. $1.14$ we have

$$
\frac{D}{v}=\frac{0.1}{1} \text {, }
$$

or $D=0.1 v=1 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, $F=f / D=8.33$.

\begin{abstract}
1012
For a camera lens, "depth of field" is how far a point object can be away from the position where it would be precisely in focus and still have the light from it fall on the film within a "circle of confusion" of some diameter, say . For a given picture derive a relation for the depth of field, $\Delta q$, as a function of the object distance $q$, the focal length of the lens, the $f$ stop and $l$. (You may consider the object distance to be much larger than the focal length.)
\end{abstract}

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $1.15$

Solution:

The Gaussian lens formula

$$
\frac{1}{q}+\frac{1}{q^{\prime}}=\frac{1}{f}
$$

gives $\frac{d q^{\prime}}{d q}=-\left(\frac{q^{\prime}}{q}\right)^{2}$. Thus for a small deviation of the object distance (depth of field), $\Delta q$, the deviation of the image distance, is

$$
\left|\Delta q^{\prime}\right| \approx|\Delta q|\left(\frac{q^{\prime}}{q}\right)^{2} .
$$

By geometry (Fig. 1.15),

$$
\frac{\Delta q^{\prime}}{l}=\frac{\left(q^{\prime}+\Delta q^{\prime}\right)}{D} \approx \frac{q^{\prime}}{D},
$$

where $D$ is the diameter of the lens. As $q \gg f, q^{\prime} \approx f$, we obtain

$$
\Delta q \approx \frac{l q^{\prime}}{D}\left(\frac{q}{q^{\prime}}\right)^{2} \approx \frac{l f}{D}\left(\frac{q}{f}\right)^{2}=\frac{l}{F}\left(\frac{q}{f}\right)^{2},
$$

where $F=\frac{D}{f}$ is the $f$ stop of the lens.

\section{3}

Ilustrate by a sketch the position and orientation of the image of the 3 -arrow object (Fig. 1.16). The length of each arrow is $1 / 2$ unit and the point $O$ is located $3 / 2 \mathrm{~F}$ from the center of the convex lens, $(F=1$ unit). Work out the length of the image arrows.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

The image of arrow a is shown in Fig. 1.17. From the geometry we get the length of the image, which is 1 unit. By symmetry, the length of the image arrow $b$ is the same as that of itself. The arrowhead of arrow $c$ is just at the focal point $F$; therefore, its image extends from $O^{\prime}$ to infinity. Fig. $1.16$ shows the positions and orientation of these images arrows.

A 55 year old man can focus objects clearly from $100 \mathrm{~cm}$ to $300 \mathrm{~cm}$. Representing the eye as a simple lens $2 \mathrm{~cm}$ from the retina, $300 \mathrm{~cm}) ?$

(a) What is the focal length of the lens at the far point (focussed at $100 \mathrm{~cm}) ?$

(b) What is the focal length of the lens at the near point (focussed at

(c) What strength lens (focal length) must he wear in the lower part of his bifocal eyeglasses to focus at $25 \mathrm{~cm}$ ?

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) $\frac{1}{f_{\text {far }}}=\frac{1}{u_{\text {far }}}+\frac{1}{v}, \quad u_{\text {far }}=300 \mathrm{~cm}, v=2 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Solving the equation yields $f_{\text {far }}=1.987 \mathrm{~cm}$.

(b) $\frac{1}{\text { fneser }^{2}}=\frac{1}{u_{\text {pear }}}+\frac{1}{v}, u_{\text {near }}=100 \mathrm{~cm}, v=2 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Solving the equation yields $f_{\text {near }}=1.961 \mathrm{~cm}$.

(c) In order to see an object at $25 \mathrm{~cm}$ clearly, the dioptric power should

$$
\Phi=\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{0.25}+\frac{1}{0.02}=54 \text { diopters }
$$

and the combined power is the sum of the powers of the eye and the glasses,

$$
\Phi=\Phi_{\text {eye }}+\Phi_{\text {glasses }} \cdot
$$

Thus $\Phi_{\text {slanses }}=\Phi-\Phi_{\text {eye }}=54-\frac{1}{0.01961}=3$ diopters $\left(\Phi_{\text {eye }}=\frac{1}{f \text { rear }}\right)$. He must wear $300^{\circ}$ far-sighted eyeglasses. The corresponding focal length is

A retro-reflector is an optical device which reflects light back directly whence it came. The most familiar retro-reflector is the reflecting corner cube, but recently the $3 \mathrm{M}$ Company invented "Scotchlite" spheres.

(a) Calculate the index of refraction $n$ and any other relevant parameters which enable a sphere to retro-reflect light.

(b) Sketch how you think Scotchlite works, and discuss qualitatively the factors which might determine the reflective efficiency of Scotchlite.

(UC,Berkeley)

Fig. $1.18$ 

\section{Solution:}

(a) The "Scotchlite" sphere is a ball of index of refraction $n$, whose rear semi-spherical interface is a reflecting surface. The focal length in the image space, $f$, for a single refractive interface is given by

$$
f=\frac{n r}{n-1},
$$

where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. The index of refraction of air is unity. The index of refraction of the glass is chosen so that the back focal point of the front semi-spherical interface coincides with the apex of the rear semi-spherical interface (see Fig. 1.18), i.e.,

$$
f=2 r \text {. }
$$

\section{Hence $n=2$.}

(b) The rear semi-spherical interface of the "Scotchlite" sphere refects the in-coming light partially, its retro-reflectance efficiency $\eta$ being given by

$$
\eta=T^{2} R,
$$

where $T$ is the transparency of the front semi-spherical interface at which light is refracted twice, being

$$
T=\frac{4 n}{(n+1)^{2}}=0.89,
$$

and $R$ is the reflectance of the rear semi-spherical interface. Here we have assumed that no absorption occurs. For silver coating, $R=0.95$, we have

$$
\eta=0.89^{2} \times 0.95=75 \% \text {. }
$$

Fig. $1.20$

\section{Solution:}

Let the required index of refraction be $n^{\prime}$, (see Fig. 1.20). If a pencil of paraxial rays which are parallel to the axis, OP, strikes at $P$, the reflected rays will return back parallel to OP. Snell's law of refraction $n^{\prime} \sin i_{2}=$ $n \sin i_{1}$ for small angles $i_{1}$ and $i_{2}$ becomes $n^{\prime} i_{2}=n i_{1}$. As $i_{3}=i_{1}, i_{3}=2 i_{2}$, we have $i_{1}=2 i_{2}$. Therefore, $n^{\prime}=2 n=\frac{8}{3}$.

\section{7}

Fig. $1.22$

\section{Solution:}

(1) Figure $1.22$ shows the angles $\phi, \alpha, \phi-\alpha, x, \delta, \alpha$ is given by Snell's law $n \sin \alpha=\sin \phi$. Since $\sin \alpha=\frac{1}{n} \sin \phi<\frac{1}{n}$, i.e., the angle of incidence $\alpha$ is smaller than the critical angle $\sin ^{-1} \frac{1}{n}$, the incident light is reflected partially at the back spherical surface.

(2) As $\alpha=(\phi-\alpha)+x$, or $x=2 \alpha-\phi$, we have $\delta=\pi-2 x=\pi-4 \alpha+2 \phi$.

(3) For minimum deflection, we require $\frac{d \delta}{d \phi}=-4 \frac{d \alpha}{d \phi}+2=0$, or $\frac{d \alpha}{d \phi}=\frac{1}{2}$. As

$$
\alpha=\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{n} \sin \phi\right),
$$

we have $\frac{d \alpha}{d \phi}=\frac{1}{n} \frac{\cos \phi}{\cos \alpha}$ and the above gives

$$
1-\frac{1}{n^{2}} \sin ^{2} \phi=\frac{4}{n^{2}} \cos ^{2} \phi,
$$

or

$$
1=\frac{1}{n^{2}}+\frac{3}{n^{2}} \cos ^{2} \phi,
$$

giving

$$
\cos ^{2} \phi=\frac{n^{2}-1}{3} .
$$

Fig. $1.28$

\section{Solution:}

(a) Owing to the symmetry of the reflecting surface, we need only to consider the vituation in a meridian plane. Let the equation of the reflecting surface be represented by (Fig. 1.23)

$$
z=f(r) \text {. }
$$

From dynamical considerations we have for a volume element $d V$

$$
\begin{gathered}
S \cos \theta=\rho g d V \\
S \sin \theta=\rho \omega^{2} r d V
\end{gathered}
$$

where $\rho$ and $S$ represent the density of mercury and the supporting force on $d V$ respectively. Thus

$$
\tan \theta=\frac{\omega^{2} r}{g} .
$$

As

$$
\tan \theta=\frac{d z}{d r},
$$

we obtain the differential equation for the reflecting surface,

$$
d z=\frac{\omega^{2} r d r}{g} .
$$

Integrating and putting $z=0$ for $r=0$, we have

$$
z=\frac{\omega^{2} r^{2}}{2 g} .
$$

For s spherical surface of radius $R$

$$
z=R-\sqrt{R^{2}-r^{2}} \approx \frac{r^{2}}{2 R}
$$

if $r<R$. The focal length of the rotating mercury surface is then

$$
f=\frac{R}{2}=\frac{g}{2 \omega^{2}} .
$$

For $f=10 \mathrm{~cm}$, we require $\omega=7 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$.

\section{9}

A spherical concave shaving mirror has a radius of curvature of 12 inches. What is the magnification when the face is 4 inches from the vertex of the mirror? Include a ray diagram of the image formation.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

The focal length of the spherical concave mirror is $f=\frac{r}{2}=6$ inches, the object distance is $u=4$ inches. inches.

Using the formula $\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}$, we get the image distance $v=-12$ is

The minus sign signifies that the image is virtual. The magnification

$$
m=\left|\frac{v}{u}\right|=3 .
$$

The ray diagram of the image formation is shown in Fig. 1.24.

Fis. $1.26$

\section{Solution:} air).

From (a), we find that the focal length of the mirror is $f_{a}=20 \mathrm{~cm}$ (in

Suppose the focal length is $f_{b}$ when the mirror is filled with water. When paraxial rays are refracted at a plane surface, the object distance $y$ and the image distance $y^{\prime}$ are related by

$$
y^{\prime}=\frac{n^{\prime} y}{n}
$$

where $n$ and $n^{\prime}$ are the refractive indices of the two media (see 1006). As now $y=f_{a}, n^{\prime}=1, n=1.33$, we have $f_{b}=y^{\prime}=\frac{f_{c}}{n}=\frac{20}{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}=15 \mathrm{~cm}$. For a concave mirror, if the object distance is equal to the image distance then it is twice the focal length, i.e.,

$$
X=2 f_{b}=30 \mathrm{~cm} .
$$

\section{1}

Given two identical watch glasses glued together, the rear one silvered. Using autocollimation as sketched (Fig. 1.26), sharp focus is obtained for $L=20 \mathrm{~cm}$. Find $L$ for sharp focus when the space between the glasses is subsequently flled with water, $n=\frac{1}{3}$.

(Wisconsin) 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-034.jpg?height=327&width=577&top_left_y=232&top_left_x=476)

Fig. $1.26$

\section{Solution:}

With air between the glasses, only the silvered watch glass reflects and converges the rays to form an image, i.e., the system acts as a concave mirror. The formula for a concave mirror

$$
\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}=\frac{2}{r}
$$

gives for $u=v=20 \mathrm{~cm}, r=20 \mathrm{~cm}$.

With water between the glasses, the incident light is refracted twice at $A$ and reflected once at $B$ before forming the final image. Note that the first image formed by $A$ falls behind the mirror $B$ and becomes a virtual object to $B$. Similarly the image formed by $B$ is a virtual object to $A$. We therefore have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{L}+\frac{n}{x} &=\frac{n-1}{20}, \\
-\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y} &=\frac{1}{10}, \\
-\frac{n}{y}+\frac{1}{L} &=\frac{n-1}{20},
\end{aligned}
$$

which yield $L=12 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Thus, a sharp image will be formed at $L=12 \mathrm{~cm}$.

An object is placed $10 \mathrm{~cm}$ in front of a convering lens of focal length $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. A diverging lens of focal length $-15 \mathrm{~cm}$ is placed $5 \mathrm{~cm}$ behind the converging lens (Fig. 1.27). Find the position, size and character of the final image.

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $1.28$

\section{Solution:}

For the first lens, the object distance is $u_{1}=10 \mathrm{~cm}$. As $f_{1}=10 \mathrm{~cm}$ also, the image distance is $v_{1}=\infty$. Then for the second lens, the object distance is $u_{2}=\infty$. As $f_{2}=-15 \mathrm{~cm}, v_{2}=-15 \mathrm{~cm}$. Hence, the image coincides with the object.

Now consider the size and character of the final image. The focal length of the combined lens system is $f=-\frac{L_{2} f_{2}}{\Delta}$, with $\Delta=d-f_{1}-f_{2}$. As $d=5 \mathrm{~cm}, f_{1}=10 \mathrm{~cm}, f_{2}=-15 \mathrm{~cm}$, we have $f=15 \mathrm{~cm}$; also, as shown in Fig. 1.28,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\overline{\mathrm{F}_{1} \overline{\mathrm{F}}}=\frac{f_{1}^{2}}{\Delta}=10 \mathrm{~cm}, \\
&\overline{\mathrm{F}_{2}^{\prime} \mathrm{F}^{\prime}}=\frac{-f_{2}^{2}}{\Delta}=-22.5 \mathrm{~cm} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Using Newton's formula, $x x^{\prime}=f^{2}$, we have for $x=-10 \mathrm{~cm}$

$$
x^{\prime}=-22.5 \mathrm{~cm} \text {. }
$$

The negative sign indicates that the image is to the left of $F^{\prime}$. The magnification is $m=\frac{-1}{x}=1.5$. Then the image is upright, virtual and magnified $1.5$ times.

Fig, $1.29$

\section{Solution:}

An object infinite distance away finds its image on the back focal plane of the converging lens, i.e., at $20-15=5 \mathrm{~cm}$ behind the diverging lens. The Gaussian lens formula

$$
\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{f}
$$

applied to the diverging lens then gives for $u=-5 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $f=-10 \mathrm{~cm}$, $v=10 \mathrm{~cm}$. The lateral magnification is

$$
m=\frac{h}{h^{\prime}}=\frac{10}{5}=2 .
$$

Hence the size of the final image is

$$
0.5 \times 2=1 \mathrm{~cm} \text {. }
$$

\section{4}

Find and describe a combination of two converging lenses which produces an inverted, virtual image at the position of the object and of the same sise. By a sketch of image formation make it clear that your scheme will work.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

$L_{1}, L_{2}$ represent two converging lenses, and $f_{1}, u_{1}, v_{1}, f_{2}, u_{2}, v_{2}$ represent the focal lengths, object distances and image distances in the sequential formation of images, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1.31.

Consider $\mathrm{L}_{2}$ first. The object of $\mathrm{L}_{2}$ must be within the focal length to form a virtual image. If $B$, the image of $L_{1}$, or the object of $L_{2}$, is at a distance of $\frac{f_{2}}{2}$ in front of $L_{2}$, the final image $C$ would be at a distance of $v_{2}=-f_{2}$ in front of $L_{2}$, where the real object $A$ is placed, and would be twice as large as $B$.

Now, we have to insert $\mathrm{L}_{1}$ between $A$ and $B$ so that $C$, which is twice the sise of $B$, is as large as $A$. Thus $u_{1}=2 v_{1}$. Furthermore, as $f_{2}=u_{1}+v_{1}+u_{2}$ we obtain

$$
u_{1}=\frac{f_{2}}{3}, v_{1}=\frac{f_{2}}{6} .
$$

The Gaussian lens formula then gives $9 f_{1}=f_{2}$.

The converging lenses $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, with focal lengths $f_{2}=9 f_{1}$, and the object should be arranged as in Fig. 1.31.

Two positive thin lenses $\mathrm{L}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{L}_{2}$ of equal focal length are separated by a distance of half their focal length (Fig, 1.32):

(a) Locate the image position for an object placed at distance $4 f$ to the left of $\mathrm{L}_{1}$.

(b) Locate the focal points of this lens combination treated as a single thick lens.

(c) Locate the principal planes for this lens combination treated as a single thick lens.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) Let $u_{1}, v_{1}, u_{2}, v_{2}$ represent object and image distances for $L_{1}$ and $\mathrm{L}_{2}$ respectively. As $u_{1}=4 f, \frac{1}{v_{1}}=\frac{1}{f_{1}}-\frac{1}{u_{1}}=\frac{3}{4 f}, v_{1}=\frac{4}{3} f$. Then as $u_{2}=\frac{l}{2}-v_{1}=-\frac{5}{6} f$, we have $\frac{1}{v_{2}}=\frac{1}{f}-\frac{1}{u_{2}}=\frac{11}{5 f}$ or $v_{2}=\frac{5 f}{11}$. Hence the final image is at $\frac{5 f}{11}$ right of $L_{2}$.

(b) Consider a beam of parallel light falling on $L$, from the left, then $v_{1}=f$ and

Therefore

$$
u_{2}=\frac{f}{2}-v_{1}=-\frac{f}{2} .
$$

$$
\frac{1}{v_{2}}=\frac{1}{f}+\frac{2}{f}=\frac{3}{f} \text {, or } v_{2}=\frac{1}{3} f \text {. }
$$

By symmetry, the two local points of the lens combination lie $\frac{1}{3}$ to the left of $L_{1}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ to the right of $L_{2}$.

(c) On the principal planes, the lateral magnification $=1$. By symmetry, the image of an object on the left principal plane formed by $\mathrm{L}_{1}$ must coincide with the image of the same object on the right principal plane formed by $L_{2}$, and both must be at the mid-point between the two lenses.

Let the left principal plane be at $x$ left of $L_{1}$. Then $u_{1}=x, v_{1}=$ $\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{4} f$, and from $\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{u_{1}}+\frac{1}{v_{1}}$ we obtain $x=-\frac{1}{3} f$.

Therefore, the two principal planes are at $\frac{L}{3}$ to the right of $L_{1}$ and $\frac{d}{3}$ to the left of $\mathrm{L}_{2}$.

A self-luminous object of height $h$ is $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ to the left of a converging lens with a focal length of $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. A second converging lens with a focal length of $20 \mathrm{~cm}$ is $30 \mathrm{~cm}$ to the right of the first lens.

(a) Calculate the position of the final image.

(b) Calculate the ratio of the height of the final image to the height $h$ of the object.

(c) Draw a ray diagram, being careful to show just those rays needed to locate the final image starting from the self-luminous object.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) From $\frac{1}{f_{1}}=\frac{1}{u_{1}}+\frac{1}{v_{1}}$, where $f_{1}=10 \mathrm{~cm}, u_{1}=40 \mathrm{~cm}$, we obtain $v_{1}=13 \frac{1}{3} \mathrm{~cm}$.

From $\frac{1}{f_{2}}=\frac{1}{u_{2}}+\frac{1}{v_{2}}$, where $f_{2}=20 \mathrm{~cm}, u_{2}=\left(30-\frac{10}{3}\right) \mathrm{cm}$, we obtain $v_{2}=-100 \mathrm{~cm}$, i.e., the final image is $100 \mathrm{~cm}$ to the left of the second lens. (b) The ratio of the final image height to the height $h$ of the object can be calculated from

$$
m=m_{2} \times m_{1}=\left(\frac{v_{2}}{u_{2}}\right)\left(\frac{v_{1}}{u_{1}}\right)=-2 .
$$

The minus sign signifies an inverted image.

where $\alpha$ is the critical angle, $n$ is the index of refraction of the plastic, assuming the index of refraction of air to be unity. Thus we require that

or

$$
\theta_{2}=\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta_{3}<\frac{\pi}{2}-\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right),
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin \theta_{1} &=n \sin \theta_{2}<n \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2}-\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right) \\
&=n \cos \left(\sin ^{-1} \frac{1}{n}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

As $\theta_{1} \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$, or $\sin \theta_{1} \leq 1$, we require $n \cos \left(\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\right)>1$ for all rays to be totally reflected in the rod. Hence the condition for total reflection is

$$
\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)<\cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) \text {, or } n>\sqrt{2}=1.414 .
$$

(b) First let us consider the effect of the first lens, $L_{1}$, alone (see Fig. 1.37). From A draw a ray parallel to the axis, which is refracted by $L_{1}$ and passes through $F_{1}^{\prime}$. Draw another ray from $A$ passing through $O_{1}$, the center of $L_{1}$. This ray is not refracted by $L_{1}$ and intersects the previous ray at $A^{\prime}$, forming the image. Draw $A^{\prime} F_{2}$ perpendicular to the axis. If $F_{2}$ is the focal point of $L_{2}$, the rays $A A^{\prime}$ and $F_{1}^{\prime} A^{\prime}$ will be refracted by $L_{2}$ and become parallel to $\mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{~A}^{\prime}$, which means that the final image will be at infinity.

Fig. $1.37$

(c) To form a telephoto lens we place the second lens between the first lens and $F_{1}^{\prime}$ so that $F_{1}^{\prime}$ coincides with $F_{2}$. Note that we require $O_{2} F_{2}<O_{1} F_{1}^{\prime}$ (see Fig. 1.38). Rays entering the system with angular spread $\alpha$ will become rays with angular spread $\alpha^{\prime}$ with $\alpha^{\prime}>\alpha$ after passing through the optical system. Such a system is commonly known as the Galilean telescope.

A thin, positive lens $L_{1}$ forms a real image of an object located very far way, as shown in Fig. 1.39. The image is located at a distance $4 l$ and has height $h$. A negative lens $\mathrm{L}_{2}$, of focal length $l$ is placed $2 l$ from $\mathrm{L}_{1}$. A positive lens, of focal length $2 l$, is placed $3 l$ from $L_{1}$, as shown in Fig. 1.40.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-043.jpg?height=284&width=537&top_left_y=484&top_left_x=457)

Fig. $1.40$
(a) Find the distance from $L_{1}$ of the resultant image.
(b) Find the image height.

(Columbia)

\section{Solution:} we have

(a) Use the Gaussian lens formula $\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{f}$. Referring to Fig. $1.41$

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\mathrm{L}_{1}: v_{1}=4 l ; \\
&\mathrm{L}_{2}: f^{2}=-l, u_{2}=-(4-2) l=-2 l, \text { giving } v_{2}=-2 l ; \\
&\mathrm{L}_{3}: f_{3}=2 l, u_{3}=2 l+l=3 l \text {, giving } v_{3}=6 l .
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, the distance from $\mathrm{L}_{1}$ of the resultant image is $3 l+6 l=9 l$.

(b) The trangverse magnification is $m=\frac{v_{2}}{u_{2}} \cdot \frac{v_{2}}{u_{3}}=2$, so the final image height is $h^{\prime}=m h=2 h$.

For the combination of one prism and 2 lenses shown (Fig. 1.42), find the location and size of the final image when the object, length $1 \mathrm{~cm}$, is located as shown in the figure.

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $1.42$

\section{Solution:}

For the right-angle prism, $n=1.5$, the critical angle $\alpha=\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)=$ $42^{\circ}$, which is smaller than the angle of incidence, $45^{\circ}$, at the hypotenuse of the prism. Therefore total internal reflection occurs, which forms a virtual image. The prism, equivalent to a glass plate of thickness $6 \mathrm{~cm}$, would cause a image shift of

$$
\Delta L=6\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)=2 \mathrm{~cm} \text {. }
$$

Thus the effective object distance for the first lens is

$$
u_{1}=10+6+(6-2)=20 \mathrm{~cm} .
$$

As $u_{1}=f_{1}$, we have $v_{1}=\infty$. Then for the second lens, $u_{2}=\infty$. With $f_{2}=-10 \mathrm{~cm}$, we get

$$
v_{2}=f_{2}=-10 \mathrm{~cm} \text {. }
$$

Hence the final image is inverted and virtual, $10 \mathrm{~cm}$ to the left of the second lens.

The sise of the image is

$$
l_{2}=\left|\frac{f_{2}}{f_{1}}\right| \cdot 1=0.5 \mathrm{~cm} .
$$

A $35 \mathrm{~mm}$ camera lens of focal length $50 \mathrm{~mm}$ is made into a telephoto lens by placing a negative lens between it and the film, as shown (Fig. 1.43). $\mathrm{L}_{1}=$ camera lens, $f_{1}=50 \mathrm{~mm} ; \mathrm{L}_{2}=$ negative lens, $f_{2}=-100 \mathrm{~mm}$.

(8) What is the distance $x$ if the system is focused at an object $50 \mathrm{~cm}$ in front of $\mathrm{L}_{1}$ ?

(b) What is the magnification produced by the lens combination?

(Wisconsin) 

\section{Solution:}

Let $u_{1}, v_{1}, f_{1}, u_{2}, v_{2}, f_{2}$ represent the object distances, image distances and focal lengths for lenses $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, respectively.

(a) $u_{1}=50 \mathrm{~cm}=500 \mathrm{~mm}$. The lens formula $\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{~J}}-\frac{1}{u}$ gives $v_{1}=\frac{500}{9}$ $\mathrm{mm}$ and $u_{2}=20 \mathrm{~mm}-v_{1}=-\frac{320}{9} \mathrm{~mm}$. It then gives

$$
\frac{1}{v_{2}}=\frac{1}{f_{2}}-\frac{1}{u_{2}}=\frac{29}{1600} \text {, or } x=v_{2}=55.2 \mathrm{~mm} \text {. }
$$

(b) The magnification of the lens combination is the product of that of each lens:

$$
\begin{aligned}
M &=\left|\frac{v_{1}}{u_{1}}\right| \times\left|\frac{v_{2}}{u_{2}}\right|=\frac{\left[\frac{(500 \times 1600)}{(9 \times 29)}\right]}{\left[\frac{(500 \times 320)}{9}\right]} \\
&=\frac{5}{29}=0.17 .
\end{aligned}
$$

\section{1}

In a compound microscope the focal length of the objective is $0.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ and that of the eyepiece is $2 \mathrm{~cm}$. If the distance between lenses is $22 \mathrm{~cm}$, what should the distance from the object to the objective be if the observer focuses for image at $\infty$ ? What is the magnifying power? Answer within $10 \%$. Derive all necessary formulae from the lens equation $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=\frac{1}{f}$. Normal near point of eye is $15 \mathrm{~cm}$.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

Apply the lens equation $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=\frac{1}{f}$. For the eyepiece (subscript 2), $q_{2}=\infty$, we get $p_{2}=f_{2}=2 \mathrm{~cm}$.

For the objective (subscript 1),

$$
q_{1}=d-p_{2}=20 \mathrm{~cm},
$$

where $d$ is the distance between the lenses. With $f_{1}=0.5 \mathrm{~cm}$, we get $p_{1}=0.51 \mathrm{~cm}$. Hence, the object is located $0.51 \mathrm{~cm}$ in front of the objective.

To find the magnifying power, let the object length be $y$. The length of the image formed by the objective is

$$
y^{\prime}=\frac{q_{1}}{p_{1}} y .
$$

The angle subtended at the eye by the final image is then

$$
\alpha^{\prime}=\frac{y^{\prime}}{f_{2}}=\frac{q_{1}}{p_{1}} \frac{y}{f_{2}} .
$$

The angle subtended at the eye by the object without use of microscope is

$$
\alpha=\frac{y}{15} .
$$

Hence the magnifying power of the microscope is

$$
m=\frac{\alpha^{\prime}}{\alpha}=\frac{15 q_{1}}{p_{1} f_{2}}=2.9 \times 10^{2} .
$$

\section{2}

Consider the diagram as shown (Fig. 1.44). A slit source is to be imaged on a screen. The light is to be parallel between the lenses. The index of refraction of the prism is $n(\lambda)=1.5+0.02\left(\lambda-\lambda_{0}\right) / \lambda_{0}$, where $\lambda_{0}=5000 \AA$. System is aligned on $5000 \AA$ A light.

(a) What are the focal lengths of the lenses?

(b) What is the linear and angular magnification of the slit at the screen? Is the image inverted? Make a ray diagram.

(c) What is the displacement off axis of light from source of $\lambda=5050 \AA$ ? Approximate where possible.

Pig. 1.44 

\section{Solution:}

(a) As the light emerging from the first lens $L_{1}$ is parallel, the slit must be on the front focal plane of $L_{1}$, i.e.,

$$
f_{1}=25 \mathrm{~cm} .
$$
have

As the parallel light is imaged by the second lens $L_{2}$ on the screen, we

$$
f_{2}=10 \mathrm{~cm} .
$$

(b) Consider the diagram shown in Fig. 1.45, which represents a coaxial optical system equivalent to the original one. For a prism with small apex angle $(\varphi=0.1 \mathrm{rad})$ the angular deviation is very small, $\delta=\varphi(n-1)=$ $0.05 \mathrm{rad}$, and we can consider $d$, the distance between $L_{1}$ and $\mathrm{L}_{2}$, to be $\approx 10 \mathrm{~cm}$. The positions of the cardinal points of the combination can be calculated as follows,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\Delta=d-f_{1}-f_{2}=-25 \mathrm{~cm}, \\
&f=-\frac{f_{1} f_{2}}{\Delta}=10 \mathrm{~cm} \\
&\overline{\mathbf{A}_{1} \mathrm{H}}=\frac{f d}{f^{2}}=10 \mathrm{~cm}, \\
&\overline{\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{H}^{\prime}}=-\frac{f d}{f_{1}}=-4 \mathrm{~cm} \\
&\overline{\mathrm{F}_{1} \mathrm{~F}}=\frac{f_{1}^{2}}{\Delta}=-25 \mathrm{~cm} \\
&\overline{\mathrm{F}_{2}^{\prime} \mathrm{F}^{\prime}}=-\frac{f_{2}^{2}}{\Delta}=4 \mathrm{~cm} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $F^{\prime}$ is $4 \mathrm{~cm}$ in front of the screen, i.e., $x^{\prime}=4 \mathrm{~cm}$, so the linear magnification is

$$
m=-\frac{x^{\prime}}{f}=-0.4
$$

The negative sign shows that the image is inverted. The ray diagram is shown in Fig. 1.45. 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-049.jpg?height=495&width=1076&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=179)

Fig. $1.45$

The angular magnification, which is the ratio of the tangents of the slopes of conjugate rays to the axis, is given by

$$
M=\frac{-1}{f+x^{\prime}}\left(\frac{1}{f+x}\right)^{-1}=-2.5 \text {. }
$$

(c) The angular derivation $\delta$ is a function of wavelength $\lambda$ through

Hence

$$
\delta=[n(\lambda)-1] \varphi .
$$

$$
\Delta \delta=\varphi \frac{d n}{d \lambda} \Delta \lambda=0.1 \times \frac{0.02}{5000} \times(5050-5000)=2 \times 10^{-5} .

(c) What is the function of the lens $\mathrm{L}_{2}$ ?

(d) Is the instrument a good match to the eye? (Explain).

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) Let us consider a bundle of parallel rays falling normally on $L_{1}$ as shown in Fig. 1.47. We are given that the back focal point of $L_{1}$ and the front focal point of $L_{3}$ coincide with the center of $L_{2}$, so the bundle of parallel rays suffers no refraction at $\mathrm{L}_{2}$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-050.jpg?height=252&width=499&top_left_y=993&top_left_x=509)

Fig. 1.47

(b) The lens $\mathrm{L}_{1}$ functions as the aperture and the entrance pupil of the telescope. The image of the aperture of $L_{1}$ formed by the following lenses is the exit pupil of the telescope, the position of which can be calculated using the lens formula twice:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{1}{S_{2}}+\frac{1}{S_{2}^{\prime}}=\frac{1}{f_{2}}, \\
&\frac{1}{S_{3}}+\frac{1}{S_{3}^{\prime}}=\frac{1}{f_{3}},
\end{aligned}
$$

where $S_{2}=10 \mathrm{~cm}, f_{2}=f_{3}=2 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Solving the two equations in turn, we have

$$
S_{2}^{\prime}=2.5 \mathrm{~cm}, S_{3}=2-2.5=-0.5 \mathrm{~cm},
$$

and hence 

$$
S_{3}^{\prime}=0.4 \mathrm{~cm},
$$

i.e., the exit pupil is located $0.4 \mathrm{~cm}$ behind $\mathrm{L}_{3}$. From the similar triangles we have $\frac{D^{\prime}}{D}=\frac{f_{3}}{f_{1}}$, so that the diameter of the exit pupil is

$$
D^{\prime}=\frac{f_{3}}{f_{1}} D=0.8 \mathrm{~cm} .
$$

(c) The lens $L_{2}$ placed at the front focal point of $L_{3}$ is called the field lens and serves as the field stop in the configuration. Its function is to converge the rays before they enter the eye lens $L_{3}$, so that one can get a comfortable image with a smaller eye lens. Furthermore, the use of a system of $L_{2}$ and $L_{3}$ of the same glass separated by $\left(f_{2}+f_{3}\right) / 2$, which has the same focal length for all colors, as the ocular eliminates lateral chromatic observation.

(d) In addition to having a large aperture objective to give the necessary resolving power, the objects will only be resolved if the magnification is sufficiently large to present the necessary separation to the eye. For this purpose the minimum magnification required is

$$
m_{0}=\frac{60}{\frac{140}{D}},
$$

where $D$ is in centimeters. However, for comfort of the eye the actual magnification should be $1.5$ to 2 times the minimum, i.e.,

$$
m=\frac{120 D}{140}=3.4
$$

with $D=4 \mathrm{~cm}$ as given.

The magnification for the given system is

$$
\frac{f_{1}}{f_{3}}=5>m .
$$

Hence, as far as magnification is concerned the system is quite up to the standard. On the other hand, for a good optical system, the exit pupil should be designed to coincide with the eye and the distance between the exit pupil and the last optical surface of the eye lens should not be less than $5 \mathrm{~mm}$. Such distance for this system is only $4 \mathrm{~mm}$, which would make the eyelash touch the optical surface. Moreover, the size of the exit pupil of a telescope should be as large as the eye, i.e., $2-4 \mathrm{~mm}$. The diameter of the exit pupil of this system is $8 \mathrm{~mm}$, so the light emerging from the telescope will not all enter the eye.

For these reasons, the telescope is not a good match to the eye.

1084

Two telescopes have the same objective lens with focal length $f_{0}$. One telescope has a converging lens for an eyepiece with focal length $f_{c}$. The other has a diverging lens for an eyepiece with focal length $-f_{\mathrm{d}}$. The magnification for these two telescopes is the same for objects at infinity. What is the ratio of the lengths of these two telescopes in terms of the magnification $M$ ? Give a good reason why one might choose to use the longer telescope for a given $M$.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

The magnification, usually the angular magnification, of a visual instrument is defined as the ratio of the angles $\omega^{\prime}$ and $\omega$ which are made by the chief rays from the top of the object with the axis at the aided and unaided eyes respectively:

\section{For a telescope}

$$
M=\frac{\omega^{\prime}}{\omega} .
$$

$$
M=-\frac{f_{0}}{f_{\mathrm{e}}} .
$$

where $f_{0}$ and $f_{\mathrm{e}}$ are the focal lengths of the objective lens and the eyepiece respectively. A telescope system uses a converging or a diverging lens as the eyepiece. A telescope with converging eyepiece is called a Keplerian telescope, while that with diverging eyepiece is called a Galilean telescope. For the Keplerian and Galilean telescopes given the magnifications are

and

$$
M_{\mathrm{K}}=-\frac{f_{0}}{f_{\mathrm{c}}}
$$

$$
M_{\mathbf{G}}=\frac{-f_{0}}{-f_{\mathrm{d}}}=\frac{f_{0}}{f_{\mathrm{d}}}
$$

respectively, where the minus sign corresponds to an inverted image and the plus an erect one. We are given that

$$
-M_{\mathrm{K}}=M_{\mathrm{G}}=M \text {, }
$$

hence 

$$
f_{\mathrm{c}}=f_{\mathrm{d}} .
$$

For a telescope, the secondary focal point of the objective coincides with the primary focal point of the eyepiece. Thus the length of a telescope is $L=f_{0}+f_{e}$.

For the two telescopes given, we have

$$
L_{\mathrm{K}}=f_{0}+f_{\mathrm{c}}, \quad L_{\mathrm{G}}=f_{0}-f_{\mathrm{d}} .
$$

Obviously,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&L_{\mathrm{K}}>L_{\mathrm{G}}, \\
&\frac{L_{\mathrm{K}}}{L_{\mathrm{G}}}=\frac{\left(f_{0}+f_{c}\right)}{\left(f_{0}-f_{d}\right)}=\frac{\left(\left(f_{0} / f_{\mathrm{c}}\right)+1\right)}{\left(\left(f_{0} / f_{\mathrm{d}}\right)-1\right)}=\frac{(M+1)}{(M-1)} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Comparing with the Galilean telescope, the advantages of the Keplerian telescope are as follows:

(a) Between the objective lens and the eyepiece, there is a real image plane where a graticule can be placed as reference mark for making measurements.

(b) A field stop can be placed in the image plane, so that the entrance window overlaps the object plane at infinity. This makes a higher quality image with a larger field of view and no vignetting.

However, the Keplerian telescope has the disadvantage that it forms an inverted image, which is inconvenient for the observer. Adding an imageinverter could eliminate this defect. Therefore, although the length of a Keplerian telescope is longer than that of a Galilean one for the same magnification, the former is still to be preferred to the latter.

(a) Derive the lens makers' formula for a thin lens

\frac{1}{f}=(n-1)\left(\frac{1}{R}+\frac{1}{R^{\prime}}\right) .
$$

(b) Crown and flint glass lenses are cemented together to form an achromatic lens. Show that the focal lengths of the crown and tint components satisfy the equation

where

\frac{\Delta_{\mathrm{c}}}{f_{\mathrm{c}}}+\frac{\Delta_{\mathrm{f}}}{f_{\mathrm{f}}}=0
$$



$$
\Delta=\frac{1}{\bar{n}-1} \frac{d n}{d \lambda} \Delta \lambda
$$

and $\bar{n}$ is the value of the index of refraction of the glass at the center of the visible spectrum and $\Delta \lambda$ the wavelength spread $(\sim 3000 \AA)$ of the visible spectrum.

(c) For crown glass $\Delta_{c}=0.0169$ and for flint glass $\Delta_{i}=0.0384$. Show that one must use a converging crown glass lens cemented to a diverging flint glass lens to get a converging achromatic lens.

(Columbia)

Solution:

(a) Please refer to any standard textbook.

(b) For the compound lens formed by cementing the two component lenses together, the focal length $f$ satisfies the equation

$$
\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{f_{c}}+\frac{1}{f_{t}} .
$$

Taking derivatives with respect to $\lambda$ yields

$$
\frac{1}{f^{2}} \frac{d f}{d \lambda}=\frac{1}{f_{c}^{2}}\left(\frac{d f_{\mathrm{c}}}{d \lambda}\right)+\frac{1}{f_{f}^{2}}\left(\frac{d f_{\mathrm{f}}}{d \lambda}\right) .
$$

Differentiating the lens makers' formula

$$
\frac{1}{f}=(n-1)\left(\frac{1}{R}+\frac{1}{R^{\prime}}\right),
$$

we have

$$
\frac{1}{f^{2}} \frac{d f}{d \lambda}=\left(\frac{1}{R}+\frac{1}{R^{\prime}}\right) \frac{d r}{d \lambda},
$$

or, making use of (3),

or,

$$
\frac{1}{f} \frac{d f}{d \lambda}=\frac{1}{\bar{n}-1} \frac{d n}{d \lambda}=\frac{\Delta}{\Delta \lambda},
$$

So we have

$$
\frac{1}{f^{2}} \frac{d f}{d \lambda}=\frac{\Delta}{\Delta \lambda} \frac{1}{f} .
$$

and

$$
\frac{1}{f_{\mathrm{c}}^{2}} \frac{d f_{\mathrm{c}}}{d \lambda}=\frac{\Delta_{\mathrm{c}}}{\Delta \lambda} \frac{1}{f_{\mathrm{c}}}
$$



$$
\frac{1}{f_{f}^{2}} \frac{d f_{f}}{d \lambda}=\frac{\Delta_{f}}{\Delta \lambda} \frac{1}{f_{f}} .
$$

Substituting these expressions into (2) and noting that $\frac{d f}{d \lambda}=0$ for an achromatic lens, we have

$$
\frac{\Delta_{c}}{f_{c}}+\frac{\Delta_{\mathrm{l}}}{f_{\mathrm{f}}}=0 .
$$

(c) Solving (1) and (4), we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{f_{c}} &=\frac{\Delta_{l}}{f\left(\Delta_{f}-\Delta_{c}\right)}, \\
\frac{1}{f_{l}} &=\frac{-\Delta_{c}}{f\left(\Delta_{t}-\Delta_{c}\right)} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Given that $\Delta_{c}<\Delta_{t}$ and the requirement $f>0$, we have

$$
f_{c}>0 \text { and } f_{t}<0 \text {. }
$$

Therefore, to get a converging achromatic lens one must use a converging crown glass lens cemented to a diverging flint glass lens.

\section{6}

A common piece of optical equipment is the viewgraph machine used in physics colloquia and seminars. A rough sketch is shown below (Fig. 1.48).

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-055.jpg?height=281&width=495&top_left_y=1308&top_left_x=443)

Fig. $1.48$

One or more optical elements are located at positions $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, \mathbf{C}$, and D. Describe each element and explain how the elements are used in the operation of the viewgraph machine. Write down the relations which must be satisfied by the distances between the elements. Which element in this device was not available at reasonable cost in $1900 ?$

(Princeton) 

\section{Solution:}

There are two types of viewgraph machines, transmission and reflection. The equipment shown belongs to the former type.

$A$ is the illumination system and consists of a lamp and a couple of condensing lenses. $B$ is a transparency to be projected. C is the image formation and projection system consisting of an objective lens and a mirror. $D$ is the screen.

The light, emitted by the lamp and condensed by the condensing lenses, illuminates the "object" - the transpareney, on which there are words or drawings. The object is imaged by the objective lens and then reflected and projected by the mirror onto the screen to form an enlarged image.

The objective lens is the key element, upon which the quality of the resultant image depends. The objective lens has to be specially designed and manufactured in order to eliminate, as much as possible, spherical and chromatic aberrations, astigmatism and field curvature. Sometimes one even employs a camera objective lens for this purpose. So the objective must have been very expensive in 1900.

The image plane of the source formed by the condensing lenses should coincide with the pupil of the objective lens. That is to say, the lamp and the pupil of the objective lens are conjugate for the condenser. The transparency and the screen should also be a pair of conjugate object and image for the objective lens. The distance between the transparency and the objective lens, the distance between the objective lens and the screen (including the distance from the objective lens to the center of the mirror and that from the center of the mirror to the screen) and the focal length of the objective lens should satisfy the lens makers' formula.

\section{7}

A lens (of focal length $f$ ) gives the image of the sun on its focal plane. Prove that the brightness of the image $\left(W / \mathrm{cm}^{2}\right)$ is near that of the surface of the sun.

(Columbia)

\section{Solution:}

The sun may be considered a Lambert source with apparent luminance, or brightness, $L$ and area $S$. The power radiated into the lens (of area $A$ and focal length $f$ ) is

$$
\Phi=\frac{L S A}{R^{2}},
$$

where $R$ is the distance between the sun and the earth. All of the power collected is directed through $S^{\prime}$ (the image of $S$ ).

The apparent luminance $L^{\prime}$ of the image is

$$
\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\prime}=L^{\prime} S^{\prime} d \Omega^{\prime},
$$

where $d \Omega^{\prime}$ is the solid angle subtended by the lens at the image, i.e.,

$$
d \Omega^{\prime}=\frac{A}{f^{2}} .
$$

If we neglect attenuation in the atmosphere and the lens, then $\Phi \approx \Phi^{\prime}$, i.e.,

$$
\frac{L S A}{R^{2}} \approx \frac{L^{\prime} A S^{\prime}}{f^{2}} .
$$

As $S / R^{2}=S^{\prime} / f^{2}$, we have

$$
L \approx L^{\prime} .
$$

\section{8}

(It is impossible to increase the apparent brightness of an extended (large solid angle) diffuse light source with lenses. This problem illustrates that fact for a single lens.) A light source of brightness $S$ subtends a solid angle that is larger than the acceptance solid angle $\Omega$ of a telescope that observes it. The source emits $S$ units of optical energy per unit area per unit solid angle per second isotropically. The objective lens of the telescope has area $A$ and is a thin lens.

(a) Show that the energy entering the telescope per second is $S \Omega A$.

(b) Show that the product of the area of the image formed by the objective lens and the solid angle subtended by the objective lens at the image i $\Omega A$.

(c) Explain why the above results show that the apparent brightness of the extended source is not changed by the objective lens of the telescope.

(UC, Berkeley)

\section{Solution:}

(a) The light flux entering the telescope per second is given by

$$
\phi=\int\left(S d \Sigma d \Sigma^{\prime} \cos \theta \cos ^{\prime} / r^{2}\right)
$$

where $d \Sigma$ is an area element of the source surface and $d \Sigma^{\prime}$ is an area element of the telescope lens, $\theta$ is the angle which the telescope axis makes with the normal to $d \Sigma, \theta^{\prime}$ is the angle which the axis makes with the normal to $d \Sigma^{\prime}, r$ is the distance between $d \Sigma$ and $d \Sigma^{\prime}$. As $\int\left(d \Sigma / r^{2}\right)$, the solid angle subtended by the source, is larger than the acceptance solid angle $\cap$ of the telescope, only light emitted from an effective area $\Omega r^{2}$ enters into the telescope, i.e., $\int\left(d \Sigma / r^{2}\right)=\Omega$. Then as $\int d \Sigma^{\prime}=A$, we have

$$
\Phi=S \Omega A \text {. }
$$

Here we have assumed that the distance between the source and the telescope is very large and that the telescope observes directly, so that both $\cos \theta$ and $\cos \theta^{\prime}$ are each equal to unity.

(b) The area of the image, $\sigma^{\prime}$, is given by

$$
\sigma^{\prime}=\Omega f^{2},
$$

where $f$ is the focal length of the objective lens of the telescope. The solid angle $\Omega^{\prime}$ subtended by the lens at the image is

$$
\Omega^{\prime}=\left(\frac{\pi D^{2}}{4}\right) / f^{2},
$$

where $D$ is the diameter of the lens. Therefore we have

$$
\sigma^{\prime} \Omega^{\prime}=\frac{\pi D^{2}}{4 f^{2}} \cdot \Omega f^{2}=\frac{\pi D^{2}}{4} \cdot \Omega=A \cdot \Omega .
$$

(c) The light flux in the image area is

$$
\Phi^{\prime}=\pi S^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime} \sin ^{2} u^{\prime},
$$

where $S^{\prime}$ is the brightness of the image, $u^{\prime}$ is the angular semi-aperture of the lens, given by $\sin u^{\prime}=\frac{D}{2 J}$. Hence

$$
\Phi^{\prime}=\pi S^{\prime}\left(\Omega f^{2}\right)\left(\frac{D}{2 f}\right)^{2}=S^{\prime} \Omega A \text {. }
$$

As the transmission coefficient of the lens is smaller than unity, i.e., $\Phi^{\prime} \leq \Phi$, we get $S^{\prime} \leq S$. That is, it is impossible to increase the apparent brightness of an extended diffuse source with a telescope. 

\section{9}

When the sun is overhead, a flat white surface has a certain luminous flux. A lens of radius $r$ and focal length $f$ is now used to focus the sun's image on the sheet. How much greater is the flux in the image area? For a given $r$, what must $f$ be so that the lens gives no increase in flux in the image? From the earth the diameter of the sun subtends about $0.01$ radians. The only light in the image is through the lens.

\section{(UC, Berkeley)}

\section{Solution:}

The luminous flux reaching the earth is given by

$$
\boldsymbol{\Phi}=B \sigma^{\prime} d \Omega
$$

where $B$ is the brightness of the sun, regarded as a Lambert radiator, $\sigma^{\prime}$ is the area illuminated on the earth, $d \Omega$ is the solid angle subtended by the sun at $\sigma^{\prime}$ and is given by

$$
d \Omega=\pi \alpha^{2},
$$

$\alpha$ being the angular aperture of the sun, equal to about $0.01$ radians.

The luminous flux on the image area behind the lens is

$$
\Phi^{\prime}=\pi B \sigma^{\prime} \sin ^{2} u^{\prime}=\pi B \sigma^{\prime}\left(\frac{r}{f}\right)^{2}
$$

where $u^{\prime}$ is the semi-angular aperture of the lens, $r$ and $f$ are the radius and focal length of the lens respectively. Consider the ratio

$$
\frac{\Phi^{\prime}}{\Phi}=\frac{\pi B \sigma^{\prime}\left(\frac{r^{2}}{f^{2}}\right)}{\pi B \sigma^{\prime}(0.01)^{2}}=\frac{10^{4} r^{2}}{f^{2}},
$$

where we have taken the transparency of the lens glass to be unity. Thus the luminous flux on the image area is $10^{4} r^{2} / f^{2}$ times that on a surface of the same ares on the earth without the lens.

For $\Phi^{\prime} / \Phi \leq 1$, we have $f \geq 10^{2}$ r. Hence, for $f \geq 100$ r the lens will give no increase in flux in the image area.

(a) Three identical positive lenses, of focal length $f$, are aligned and separated by a distance $f$ from each other, as shown in Fig. 1.49. An object is located $f / 2$ in front of the leftmost lens. Find the position and the magnification power of the resultant image by using tracing method.

(b) Looking through a small hole is a wellknown method to improve sight. If your eyes are near-sighted and can focus an object $20 \mathrm{~cm}$ away without using any glasses, estimate the required diameter of the hole through which you would have good sight for objects far away.

(Columbia)

Fig. $1.49$

\section{Solution:}

(a) We construct the image using two rays passing through the top of the object, one parallel to the axis, the other through the front focal point of $L_{1}$, as shown in Fig. 1.50. The resultant image is found at a distance $f / 2$ behind the rightmost lens. The magnification is $-1$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-060.jpg?height=255&width=571&top_left_y=975&top_left_x=506)

Fis. $1.50$

(b) Inside the human eye the distance between the crystalline lens and the retina is $20 \mathrm{~mm}$. Using the lens formula $\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{f}$, we get $f=19 \mathrm{~cm}$ for the image distance $2.0 \mathrm{~cm}$ and the object $20 \mathrm{~cm}$ away.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-060.jpg?height=175&width=452&top_left_y=1417&top_left_x=557)

Fig. $1.61$

As Fig. $1.51$ shows, a lens focuses an object infinitely far away at the focal point $F$ and forms a disk $A B$ on the retina $1.0 \mathrm{~cm}$ behind $F$. An opening placed in front of the eye lens determines the diameter of the beam of light entering the eye. From the geometry, $d=\overline{\mathrm{CD}}=19 \overline{\mathrm{AB}}$. On account of the resolving angular limitation of the eye, which is about $1^{\prime}=3 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{rad}$, we get a transverse resolving limitation of $\overline{\mathrm{AB}}_{\mathrm{m}}=3 \times 10^{-4} \times 20=6 \times 10^{-3}$ $\mathrm{mm}$. If the diameter of the opening $d<19 \times 6 \times 10^{-3}=0.12 \mathrm{~mm}$, we would have good sight for objects far away.

\section{1}

One side of a disk, $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ area, radiates uniformly and isotropically (a Lambert's law radiator) with a brightness of 1 watt $\cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ steradian ${ }^{-1}$ at a single frequency in the visible. the disk?

(a) What is the total rate at which energy is radiated from this face of

(b) Given a fused quarts lens $(n=1.5)$ whose diameter is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$ and whose focal length is $100 \mathrm{~cm}$, show how to image the radiator onto a disk whose area is $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

(c) Detimate the total energy fux reaching the $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ disk to within a few percent.

(d) By changing $n$ and the dimensions of the lens, you may increase the energy flux reaching the $\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ disk. By what reasoning might you determine the maximum energy fux into the $\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ disk that can be achieved?

(CUSPEA)

\section{Solution:}

(a) $\Phi=B S \int_{0}^{2 \pi} d \varphi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin \theta \cos \theta d \theta=\pi B S=3.14 \mathrm{~W}$, where $B$ is the brightness of the source, $S$ the area of the source, $\theta$ the angle between the direction of the emitted light and the normal to the surface of the source.

(b) The magnification is given by

$$
m=\frac{D^{\prime}}{D}=\left(\frac{S^{\prime}}{S}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}=0.5
$$

where $D^{\prime}, D, S^{\prime}$ and $S$ are the diameters and the areas of the image and the object respectively. As $m=\frac{v}{u}=0.5$, we have $u=2 v$.

The lens equation then gives $u=3 f=300 \mathrm{~cm}, v=\frac{3 f}{2}=150 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, if the object and image distances are $300 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $150 \mathrm{~cm}$ respectively, the lens images the source onto a disk of area $0.25 \mathrm{~cm}$.

(c) If the lens does not cause attenuation, the energy flux reaching the $\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ disk would be equal to that reaching the lens. The solid angle subtended by the lens at the source is

$$
n=\frac{\pi r^{2}}{u^{2}} .
$$

The total energy flux reaching the lens is then

$$
\Phi^{\prime}=B S \Omega=1 \times 1 \times \pi \frac{5^{2}}{300^{2}}=8.7 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~W} .
$$

(d) According to the second law of thermodynamics, the brightness of the image cannot exceed that of the object. So the maximum energy flux into the $\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ disk is

$$
\Phi^{\prime \prime}=\frac{\Phi S^{\prime}}{S}=\frac{\Phi}{4}=0.785 \mathrm{~W} .
$$



\section{PART 2 WAVE OPTICS}

The width of a certain spectral line at $500 \mathrm{~nm}$ is $2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~nm}$. Approximately what is the largest path difference for which interference fringes produced by this light are clearly visible?

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

The coherence length $l_{c}$ is given by

$$
. \lambda_{c}=\frac{\lambda^{2}}{\Delta \lambda}=1.25 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~cm} .
$$

If the optical path difference is about a quarter of $l_{c}, 3 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}$, we can observe the fringes clearly.

\section{2}

A point source $S$ located at the origin of a coordinate system emits a spherical sinusoidal wave in which the electric field $E_{1}$ is given by $E_{1}=$ $A\left(\frac{D}{r}\right) \cos \left(\omega t-\frac{2 \pi r}{\lambda}\right)$, where $r$ is the distance from $S$. In addition, there is a plane wave propagating along the $x$-axis. This wave is given by

$$
E_{2}=A \cos \left(\omega t-\frac{2 \pi x}{\lambda}\right) .
$$

(Note that we treat both $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ as scalar waves in this problem.) Both waves are incident on a flat screen perpendicular to the $x$-2xis and at a distance $D$ from the origin, as shown in the figure (Fig. 2.1). Compute the resultant intensity $I$ at the screen as a function of the distance $y$ from the $x$-axis for values of $y$ small compared with $D$. Express $I$ in terms of $y, D, \lambda$ and the intensity $I_{0}$ at $y=0$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-065.jpg?height=357&width=492&top_left_y=1499&top_left_x=463)

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $2.1$ Solution:

The electric field $E$ at a point, distance $r$ from the origin, on the screen is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
E &=E_{1}+E_{2}=A\left[\frac{D}{r} \cos \left(\omega t-\frac{2 \pi r}{\lambda}\right)+\cos \left(\omega t-\frac{2 \pi x}{\lambda}\right)\right] \\
& \approx A\left[\cos \left(\omega t-\frac{2 \pi r}{\lambda}\right)+\cos \left(\omega t-\frac{2 \pi x}{\lambda}\right)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

where we have used the approximation $r \approx D$.

For $y<D$, we have

$$
r=\left(D^{2}+y^{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \approx D\left(1+\frac{y^{2}}{2 D^{2}}\right)
$$

and thus

Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
E &=A\left[\cos \left(\omega t-\frac{2 \pi D\left(1+\frac{y^{2}}{2 D^{2}}\right)}{\lambda}\right)+\cos \left(\omega t-\frac{2 \pi D}{\lambda}\right)\right] \\
&=2 A \cos \frac{\pi y^{2}}{D \lambda} \cdot \cos \left(\omega t-\frac{2 \pi D\left(1+\frac{y^{2}}{4 D^{2}}\right)}{\lambda}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
I \propto E^{2} \propto \cos ^{2} \frac{\pi y^{2}}{D \lambda} .
$$

Let $I=I_{0}$ at $y=0$; we then have

$$
I=I_{0} \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi y^{2}}{D \lambda}\right) .
$$

As the distance from the centre increases, the fringes become closer. This is similar to Fresnel's zone plate.

\section{8}

A two-slit Young's interference experiment is arranged as illustrated (Fig. 2.2); $\lambda=5000 \AA$. When a thin film of a transparent material is put behind one of the slits, the zero order fringe moves to the position previously occupied by the 4th order bright fringe. The index of refraction of the film is $n=1.2$. Calculate the thickness of the film.

(Wisconsin)

Solution: Thus

Intensity maxima occur when the optical path difference is $\Delta=m \lambda$.

$$
\delta \Delta=\lambda \delta m .
$$

When the film is inserted as shown in Fig. 2.2, the optical path changes by

$$
\delta \Delta=t(n-1),
$$

where $t$ is the thickness of the film. As the interference pattern shifts by 4 fringes,

$$
\delta m=4 .
$$

Hence $t(n-1)=4 \lambda$, giving

$$
t=\frac{4 \lambda}{n-1}=10 \mu \mathrm{m} .
$$

Consider the interference pattern from the three slits illustrated (Fig. 2.3). Assume the openings of the individual slits are the same $\left(\$ \frac{\lambda}{2}\right)$.

(a) At what value of $\theta$ is the first principal maximum? (i.e., the wavelets from all three slits are in phase).

(b) The result for (a) can be called $\theta_{1}$. The flux in the direction of seroth order maximum $(\theta=0)$ is $F_{0}$. What is the flux (in units of $F_{0}$ ) in the direction $\frac{\theta_{1}}{2}$ ? (Assume $\lambda \ll d_{\text {. }}$ ) 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-068.jpg?height=337&width=402&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=573)

Fig. $2.3$

\section{Solution:}

(a) The electric field $E(\theta)$ on the screen is the sum of the fields produced by the slits individually:

$$
E(\theta)=E_{1}+E_{2}+E_{3}=A+A e^{i \delta}+A e^{i \frac{5}{2} \delta},
$$

where

$$
\delta=\frac{2 \pi d}{\lambda} \sin \theta .
$$

Then the total intensity at $\theta$ is

$$
I(\theta) \sim E(\theta) \cdot E^{*}(\theta)=A^{2}\left\{3+2\left[\cos \delta+\cos \left(\frac{3 \delta}{2}\right)+\cos \left(\frac{5 \delta}{2}\right)\right]\right\} .
$$

For $\theta=0$, we have

$$
I(0) \sim 9 A^{2} \text {. }
$$

The expression for $I(\theta)$ shows that the first principal maximum occurs at $\delta=4 \pi$, i.e.,

or

$$
\left(\frac{2 \pi d}{\lambda}\right) \sin \theta_{1}=4 \pi,
$$

$$
\theta_{1} \approx \sin \theta_{1} \sim \frac{2 \lambda}{d} .
$$

(b)

$$
I\left(\frac{\theta_{1}}{2}\right) \sim A^{2}[3+2(\cos 2 \pi+\cos 3 \pi+\cos 5 \pi)]=A^{2} \sim \frac{I(0)}{9} .
$$



\section{5}

An opaque screen with two parallel slits is placed in front of a lens and illuminated with light from a distant point source.

(b) Indicate with a second graph and a brief explanation the effect of moving the slits further apart.

(c) Indicate with a third graph and explanation the effect of increasing the sise of the source so that it subtends a finite angle at the lens.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) The interference picture is shown in Fig. 2.4. The spacing of fringes is $\Delta x=\frac{\lambda f}{d}$, where $d$ is the distance between the two slits, $f$ the focal length of the lens.

(b) As $d$ increases, $\Delta x$ decreases, fringes become denser. The interference pattern is shown in Fig. 2.5.

Consider the Young's interference experiment shown in the diagram (Fig. 2.7).

Assume that the wavelength of the light is $6000 \AA$, the slit widths are all the same, $S_{0}=S_{1}=S_{2}=0.2 \mathrm{~mm}$, the slit separation $d=2.0 \mathrm{~mm}$, and $L_{1}=3.0 \mathrm{~m}$.

(a) About how long must $L_{0}$ be in order to produce a well-defined interference pattern on the screen?

(b) What is the distance between the central and first bright fringe on the screen?

(Wisconain)

$\mathrm{Fig} .2 .8$

Solution:

(a) According to the Van Cittert Zernike theorem, the lateral coherence length of an extended slit source is given by

$$
I_{\mathrm{s}}=\frac{\lambda}{\theta_{\mathrm{a}}},
$$

where $\theta_{3}$ is the angle subtended by the slit at the point concerned in radians. In order to get a clear interference pattern, the distance between $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ should be less than $l_{s}$, i.e.,

$$
d<l_{B},
$$

or As

$$
\theta_{s}<\frac{\lambda}{d} .
$$

$$
\theta_{\bullet}=\frac{S_{0}}{L_{0}},
$$

we require that

$$
L_{0}>\frac{d}{\lambda} S_{0}=\frac{2 \times 10^{-1}}{6000 \times 10^{-10}} \times 2 \times 10^{-3}=0.67 \mathrm{~m} .
$$

(b) Referring to Fig. 2.8, consider the sum of the contributions to the amplitude at $P$ of the screen of width elements $d y$ at the points $y$ and $-y$ of the slits $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ respectively. As $d \gg S_{1}, S_{2}$, it is proportional to

$$
\left[e^{i k(x-y \sin \theta)}+e^{i k(x+y \sin \theta)}\right] d y=e^{i k x} \cos (k y \sin \theta) d y,
$$

where $k=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}$.

Then the total amplitude at $P$ is

$$
A \propto \int_{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{2}{2}}^{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos (k y \sin \theta) d y
$$

as $S_{1}=S_{2}=S$. With $\sin \theta \approx \frac{x}{L_{2}}$, we have

$$
A(x)=2 A_{0} S\left(\frac{\sin \frac{\pi x}{\lambda L_{2}} S}{\frac{\pi x}{\lambda L_{1}} S}\right) \cdot \cos \left(\frac{\pi x}{\lambda L_{1}} d\right),
$$

where $A_{0}=$ constant. The intensity $I(x)$ is therefore

$$
I(x) \propto \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi x}{\lambda L_{1}} d\right) .
$$

For $\frac{\pi f d}{\lambda L_{1}}=\pi$, the first maximum occurs, corresponding to

$$
x=\frac{\lambda L_{1}}{d}=0.9 \mathrm{~mm} .
$$

Therefore, the first bright fringe is $0.9 \mathrm{~mm}$ away from the center of the interference pattern. 

\section{7}

A two-slit diffraction pattern is produced by the arrangement shown in Fig. 2.9. A discharge tube produces light of wavelength $\lambda$ which passes through a small slit $S$ immediately in front of the tube. The centers of the two slits of width $w$ are at distance $D$ apart. Find the condition that a maximum intensity be observed at the screen a distance $l$ from the central plane. Assume that $D \ll L, l \ll L$, and that $w$ is very small. How large may $w$ be before the interference pattern is washed out? As $w$ increases, do the maxima and minima wash out first near the midplane or further away? What is the effect on the intensity and sharpness of the pattern of increasing the width $S$ of the slit at the source?

(Wisconsin)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-072.jpg?height=602&width=818&top_left_y=779&top_left_x=341)

Fig. $2.9$

Solution:

The intensity distribution on the screen produced by the elemental slit of width $d y$ of the slit sources is given by

$$
d I=2 I_{0}\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2}(1+\cos \delta) d y,
$$

where $\beta=\frac{\pi w l}{\lambda L}=\frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{\lambda}$ with $\sin \theta=\frac{l}{L}, \delta=\delta_{1}+\delta_{2}$ with

$$
\delta_{1}=2 \pi D \sin \theta / \lambda, \quad \delta_{2}=2 \pi D y / \lambda x,
$$

and $I_{0}$ is a constant. Integration yields the intensity distribution produced by the slit source:

$$
\begin{aligned}
I &=2 I_{0}\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2} \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{s}{2}}(1+\cos \delta) d y \\
&=2 I_{0} S\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2}\left\{1+\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi D S}{\lambda x}\right)}{\left(\frac{\pi D S}{\lambda x}\right)} \cos \left(\frac{2 \pi D}{\lambda} \sin \theta\right)\right\} .
\end{aligned}
$$

If $2 \pi D \sin \theta / \lambda=2 \pi D l / \lambda L=2 n \pi$, i.e., $l=\frac{n \lambda L}{D}$, where $n$ is an integer, maximum intensity is observed on the screen at distance $l$ from the central plane.

The interference pattern is washed out for the first time if $\sin \beta=0$, or $\beta=\pi w l /(\lambda L)=\pi$, i.e., $w=\frac{\lambda L}{l}=D$. In general, $w=\frac{D}{n}$, or $n=\frac{D}{w}$. As $w$ increases, $n$ decreases. That is to say, the maxima and minima will first wash out further away from the midplane.

The visibility of the fringes is determined by

$$
V=\left(\frac{I_{\max }-I_{\min }}{I_{\max }+I_{\min }}\right)=\left|\frac{\sin \frac{\pi D S}{\lambda x}}{\frac{\pi D S}{\lambda x}}\right|,
$$

where $I_{\max }$ and $I_{\min }$ are the intensities at the maxima and minima of the fringe pattern. If $\pi D S /(\lambda x)=n \pi$, where $n$ is an integer, then $V=0$. Within $S_{0}=\lambda x / D$, as $S$ increases, the visibility of the fringes decreases.

From the expression for $I$, it is obvious that the intensity on the screen is proportional to the width $S$ of the slit at the source.

Fresnel biprism. A Fresnel biprism of refractive index $n$ and small equal base angles $\alpha$ is constructed as shown in the sketch (Fig. 2.10).

(a) A ray of light incident from the left normal to the base of the prism may enter either the upper or lower half. Obtain the angular deviation $\theta$ for the two cases. Assume $\alpha$ small. Draw and label a sketch.

(b) A plane wave is incident normal to the base of the prism, illuminating the entire prism. Fringes are observed in the transmitted light falling on a screen parallel to the base of the prism. What is the origin of these fringes? Obtain an expression for the fringe separation in terms of the sngle of deviation $\theta$ of an incident ray. Draw and label a sketch. (c) With a glass biprism in yellow light a fringe separation of 100 $\mu \mathrm{m}\left(10^{-2} \mathrm{~cm}\right)$ is observed. Estimate in degrees the base angles $\alpha$ of the prism.

(a) A beam of light incident normal on the base undergoes refraction at the side surfaces. A ray of light emerging from the upper half of the prism travels obliquely downwards, and by symmetry, one from the lower half travels obliquely upwards, as shown in Fig. 2.11. The magnitudes of the angular deviation for the two cases are the same, being given for small $\alpha$ by

$$
\theta=(n-1) \alpha .
$$

(b) The two parallel beams of light emerging symmetrically from the upper and lower halves of the prism meet and interfere with each other and interference fringes along the $x$ axis appear on the screen. The spacing of the fringes is given by

$$
\Delta y=\frac{\lambda}{2 \sin \theta} \approx \frac{\lambda}{2 \theta}=\frac{\lambda}{2(n-1) \alpha} .
$$

(c) For yellow light of $\lambda=6000 \AA$ and biprism of index of refraction $n=1.5, \Delta y=100 \mu \mathrm{m}$ gives $\alpha=6 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{rad}=21^{\prime}$.

A Lloyd's mirror (see Fig. 2.12) can be used to obtain interference fringes on the screen from a single source as shown. Construct (draw) a two (coherent) source system which is equivalent. The first fringe (at the point 0$)$ is dark. What does this imply?

Fig. $2.13$

Solution:

A two-source system equivalent to the Lloyd's mirror is shown in Fig. 2.13. The dark fringe at the point 0 implies that the beam reflected from the mirror surface undergoes a phase change of $\pi$ on reflection.

\begin{abstract}

A Michelson interferometer is adjusted to give a fringe pattern of concentric circles when illuminated by an extended source of light of $\lambda=$ 5000 $\AA$. How far must the movable arm be displaced for 1000 fringes to emerge from the center of the bullseye? If the center is bright, calculate the angular radius of the first dark ring in terms of the path length difference between the two arms and the wavelength $\lambda$.
\end{abstract}

(Wisconsin)

\title{
Solution:
}

Concentric circles, called fringes of equal inclination, are obtained when the two reflecting mirrors are exactly mutually perpendicular. The optical path length difference $\Delta$ between the two arms is given by

$$
\Delta=2 n d \cos \theta=2 n\left(l_{1}-l_{2}\right) \cos \theta,
$$

where $n$ is the index of refraction of the medium (for air, $n=1$ ), $d=l_{1}-l_{2}$ is the path length difference (OPD) between the arms of lengths $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$, $\theta$ is the angle of incidence of light at the mirrors.

(1) For 1000 fringes to emerge from the center of the bullseye, the OPD $\Delta$ must undergo a change of $1000 \lambda$. Thus $2 d=1000 \lambda$, or $d=500 \lambda=0.25$ $\mathrm{mm}$, i.e., the movable arm is displaced by $0.25 \mathrm{~mm}$. (2) If the center is bright, we have

$$
2 d=m \lambda,
$$

where $m$ is an integer.

For the first dark ring, we have

$$
2 d \cos \theta=\left(m-\frac{1}{2}\right) \lambda .
$$

\section{Subtracting yields}

$$
2 d(1-\cos \theta)=\frac{\lambda}{2} .
$$

For small $\theta, \cos \theta \approx 1-\frac{\theta^{2}}{2}$, hence

$$
\theta \approx \sqrt{\lambda / 2 d} \operatorname{rad} .
$$

For $d=0.25 \mathrm{~mm}$, we obtain $\theta=0.032 \mathrm{rad}=1.8^{\circ}$.

\section{1}

Find the thickness of a soap film that gives constructive second order interference of reflected red light $(\lambda=7000 \AA)$. The index of refraction of the film is 1.33. Assume a parallel beam of incident light directed at $30^{\circ}$ to the normal.

(Chicago)

\section{Solution:}

Within a limited region the flm can be considered as a parallel-sided slab of $n=1.33$. The optical path difference of the beams reflected at the upper and the lower surfaces is

$$
\Delta=2 n d \cos \theta+\frac{\lambda}{2},
$$

For constructive second-order interference, we have

$$
\Delta=2 \lambda,
$$

or 

$$
d=\frac{3 \lambda}{4 n \cos \theta},
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle of refraction inside the film. From Snell's law, we have

$$
\sin \theta_{0}=n \sin \theta,
$$

i.e.,

or

$$
\sin \theta=\frac{1}{n} \sin \theta_{0}=\frac{1}{2 n},
$$

$$
\cos \theta=\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{1}{2 n}\right)^{2}}
$$

which yields

$$
d=4260 \AA
$$

\section{2}

A vertical soap film is viewed horisontally by reflected sodium light $\left(\lambda=889 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}\right)$. The top of the film is so thin that it looks black in all colors. There are five bright fringes, the center of the fifth being at the bottom. How thick is the soap film at the bottom? The index of refraction of water is $1.33$.

(Wisconsin)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-077.jpg?height=251&width=431&top_left_y=1292&top_left_x=510)

Fig. $2.14$

Solution:

The thickness at the top of the film is much less than $\lambda /(4 n)$, where $\lambda$ is the average wavelength of the visible spectrum of about $550 \mathrm{~nm}$, and can be neglected. The phase difference between the rays (marked 1 and 2 in Fig. 2.14) reflected at the left and right surfaces then approaches $\pi$ (additional phase shift on reflection), and the film appears black by reflected light. The phase difference between the two beams at the bottom is

$$
\delta=\pi+\frac{2 n d}{\lambda} \cdot 2 \pi,
$$

where $d$ is the thickness. For the centre of the fifth fringe, we have

$$
\delta=10 \pi .
$$

Using the given values of $\lambda$ and $n$, we get

$$
d=1.0 \mu \mathrm{m} \text {. }
$$

\section{3}

White light is incident normally on a thin film which has $n=1.5$ and a thickness of $5000 \AA$. For what wavelengths in the visible spectrum $(4000-7000 \AA)$ will the intensity of the reflected light be a maximum?

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

Constructive interference occurs for

$$
\mathrm{OPD}=2 n t=k \lambda+\frac{\lambda}{2},
$$

where $t$ is the thickness of the film, $k$ an integer. Hence for maximum reflection the wavelengths are

$$
\lambda=\frac{4 n t}{2 k+1}=\left\{\begin{aligned}
6000 \AA & \text { for } k=2 \\
4285 \AA & \text { for } k=3
\end{aligned}\right.
$$

\section{4}

A lens is to be coated with a thin film with an index of refraction of $1.2$ in order to reduce the reflection from its surface at $\lambda=5000 \AA$. The glass of the lens has an index of refraction of 1.4, as shown in Fig. 2.15.

(a) What is the minimum thickness of the coating that will minimise the intensity of the reflected light?

(b) In the above case the intensity of the reflected light is small but not sero. Explain. What needs to be changed, and by how much, to make the intensity of the reflected light zero?

(Wisconsin) 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-079.jpg?height=177&width=454&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=488)

Fig. $2.15$

\section{Solution:}

(a) If the light beams reflected from the two surfaces of the coating film are in antiphase,

$$
2 n_{1} t=\lambda / 2,
$$

or $t=\lambda /\left(4 n_{1}\right)=0.10 \mu \mathrm{m}$, the intensity of the reflected light will be minimised.

(b) When light is incident normally from medium $A$ of refractive index $n_{A}$ into medium $B$ of $n_{B}$, the coefficient of reflection $R$ is given by

$$
R=\left[\left(n_{A}-n_{B}\right) /\left(n_{A}+n_{B}\right)\right]^{2} .
$$

The coefficients of reflection at the upper and lower surfaces of the coating are respectively

and

$$
R_{1}=\left(\frac{n_{1}-n_{0}}{n_{1}+n_{0}}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{1}{1.1}\right)^{2}
$$

$$
R_{2}=\left(\frac{n_{1}-n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{1}{1.3}\right)^{2} .
$$

Because $R_{1} \neq R_{2}$, the intensities of the light beams reflected from the two surfaces of the film are not identical and the intensity of the resultant light is not sero even though destructive interference occurs. If the index of refraction of the coating is $n_{1}^{\prime}$ so that $R_{1}=R_{2}$, i.e.,

$$
\left(\frac{n_{1}^{\prime}-n_{0}}{n_{1}^{\prime}+n_{0}}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{n_{1}^{\prime}-n_{2}}{n_{1}^{\prime}+n_{2}}\right)^{2},
$$

the intensity of the resultant reflected light would be zero. This requires that

$$
n^{\prime}=\sqrt{n_{0} n_{2}}=1.18 .
$$



\section{5}

A thin glass sheet has a thickness of $1.2 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}$ and an index of refraction $n=1.50$. Visible light with wavelengths between $400 \mathrm{~nm}$ and $700 \mathrm{~nm}$ is normally incident on the glass sheet. What wavelengths are most intensified in the light reflected from the sheet? $\left(\mathrm{nm}=10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}\right)$

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

Constructive interference occurs for

$$
\mathrm{OPD}=2 n d+\frac{\lambda}{2}=k \lambda,
$$

where $d$ is the thickness of the film, $k$ an integer. Hence for maximum reflection,

$$
\lambda=\frac{2 n d}{k-\frac{1}{2}} .
$$

In the wavelength range 400 to $700 \mathrm{~nm}$, the most intensive reflected wavelengths are $\lambda_{1}=424 \mathrm{~nm}\left(\right.$ for $k=9$ ),$\lambda_{2}=480 \mathrm{~nm}\left(\right.$ for $k=8$ ) , $\lambda_{3}=554$ nm (for $k=7$ ), $\lambda_{4}=655 \mathrm{~nm}$ (for $k=6$ ).

\section{6}

A $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ film of index $2.5$ is placed on glass of index $1.5$ to increase the reflection in the visible. Choosing a suitable value for wavelength, how thick a layer in microns would you want, and what reflectivity would this give you?

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

Let $n_{0}, n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$, and $d$ represent repectively the indices of refraction of air, $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ film and glass, and the thickness of the film. Destructive interference between the reflected light occurs for

$$
\mathrm{OPD}=2 n d-\frac{\lambda}{2}=\left(k-\frac{1}{2}\right) \lambda
$$

where $k$ is an integer, and the additional half wavelength is caused by the phase shift at the air- $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ interface. For $k=0$ and $\lambda=5500 \AA$, we have $d=\lambda /\left(4 n_{1}\right)=0.055 \mu \mathrm{m}$. Hence the reflectivity is

$$
R_{\lambda_{0}}=\left(\frac{n_{0}-\frac{n_{1}^{2}}{n_{2}}}{n_{0}+\frac{n_{1}^{2}}{n_{2}}}\right)^{2}=0.376 .
$$

\section{7}

A soap film $(n=4 / 3)$ of thickness $d$ is illuminated at normal incidence by light of wavelength $500 \mathrm{~nm}$. Calculate the approximate intensities of interference maxima and minima relative to the incident intensity as $d$ is varied, when viewed in reflected light.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-081.jpg?height=274&width=332&top_left_y=803&top_left_x=543)

(Wisconsin)

Fig. 2.16

\section{Solution:}

The reflectivity at each surface of the soap film is given by

$$
R=\left[\frac{\left(n-n_{0}\right)}{\left(n+n_{0}\right)}\right]^{2}=\left[\frac{\left(\frac{4}{3}-1\right)}{\left(\frac{4}{3}+1\right)}\right]^{2} \approx 0.02 .
$$

For a film of low reflectivity $R$, the intensity of the reflected light at either surface can be approximately represented by $R I_{0}$, where $I_{0}$ is the intensity of the incident light. The intensity of the interference pattern is therefore

$$
I=2 R I_{0}(1+\cos \delta)_{1}
$$

where $\sigma$ is the phase difference between the beams of reflected light at the two surfaces of the soap film given by

$$
\delta=\left(\frac{2 \pi d}{\lambda}\right) \cos \theta,
$$

$\theta$ being the angle of incidence. 

\section{Hence}

$$
\begin{aligned}
&I \max / I_{0}=4 R=0.08 \\
&I_{\min } / I_{0}=0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Fig. $2.18$

\section{Solution:}

Consider two coherent rays leaving a point source as shown in Fig. 2.18. Ray 1 is reflected by the mirror and then scattered by a grain towards a certain point in space. Ray 2 is first scattered by the grain towards the mirror and then reflected back towards the abovementioned point.

The resulting OPD determines the interference at the point. At normal incidence, the pattern is a series of concentric rings of radii $r$ :

$$
r=\left(\frac{n m \lambda a^{2} b^{2}}{d\left(a^{2}-b^{2}\right)}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}},
$$

where $n$ is the index of refraction of the glass, $d$ the thickness of the glass slab, $\lambda$ the wavelength of light, $a$ the distance between the slab and the point source, $b$ the distance between the slab and the interference point, $m$ an integer.

For white light source, color rings appear as different frequencies give rise to different rings.

The rings are bright because of constructive interference.

\section{9}

A $6 \mathrm{~mm}$ thick glass window $2 \mathrm{~cm}$ in diameter is claimed to have each surface flat to within $1 / 4$ wave of mercury green light $(\lambda=546 \mathrm{~nm})$, and the pair of surfaces parallel to within 5 seconds of arc ( $1 \mathrm{arc} \mathrm{sec}=4.85 \times 10^{-6}$ radians). How would you measure these properties to verify the manufacturer's specifications? Your may assume the refractive index of the glass is $n=1.500$.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

To test the flatness of a surface, we place a plano-convex lens of long focal length on it with the convex side down. We then illuminate it from above with the mercury green light as shown in Fig. $2.19$ and observe the Newton's rings formed. The spacing between adjacent rings corresponds to a change of thickness of the air gap of $\frac{\lambda}{2}$. For flatness to within $\frac{\lambda}{4}$, the distortion of a ring should be less than one-half of the spacing.

To test the parallelness of the surfaces of the glass window we consider it as a wedge of glass of refractive index $n=1.500$. Illuminating it from the above, we shall observe interference fringes such that in going from one fringe to the next, the thickness $d$ changes by $\frac{\lambda}{2 n}$. For a wedge angle $\theta$, the spacing is

$$
S=\frac{\Delta d}{\theta}=\frac{\lambda}{2 n \theta} .
$$

For $\theta \lesssim 5 \times 4.85 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{rad}$, we require that

$$
S \gtrsim \frac{546 \times 10^{-7}}{2 \times 1.5 \times 24.25 \times 10^{-6}}=0.75 \mathrm{~cm}
$$

Both of the above conditions should be met to justify the manufacturer's claims.

Fig. $2.20$

\section{Solution:}

(a) The radii of the bright Newton's rings are given by the following formula,

$$
r_{j}=\sqrt{(2 j+1) \frac{\lambda}{2} R} \quad(j=0,1,2, \ldots) \text {. }
$$

For the third bright ring, $j=2$, and the radius is

$$
r=\sqrt{(4+1) \times \frac{650 \times 10^{-7}}{2} \times 30}=0.7 \mathrm{~mm}
$$



\section{i.e., the diameter is}

$$
d=2 r=1.4 \mathrm{~mm} .
$$

(b) From the formula we see that $d=2 r \propto \sqrt{R}$. It should be noted that in deriving the formula we have already used an approximation based on large $R$.

\section{1}

A double-slit interference is produced by plane parallel light of wavelength $\lambda$ passing through two slits of unequal widths, say $w_{1}=20 \lambda$ and $w_{\Omega}=40 \lambda$, their centers being $1000 \lambda$ apart. If the observation is made on a screen very far away from the slits, i.e., at a distance $L \gg 1000 \lambda$, determine the following features:

(a) Separation $\delta x$ between adjacent maxima.

(b) Widths $\Delta x_{1}$ and $\Delta x_{2}$ of the central maxima of the diffraction patterns of the two slits individually (i.e., distances between the first zeros).

(c) Hence, the number of fringes produced by the overlap of these central maxima.

(d) The intensity ratio between intensity maximum and minimum in the center of the pattern.

(e) An analytic expression for the intensity on the screen as a function of $x$ when $x=0$ is at the exact center of the pattern.

Show your reasoning.

$(U C$, Berkeley)

Fig. $2.21$

\section{Solution:}

(a) As $w_{2}=2 w_{1}, L>w_{1}, w_{2}$, we may take the amplitudes of the electric field vectors produced by the slits $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ individually on the screen to be $E$ and $2 E$ respectively. Since $I \propto E^{2}$, the corresponding intensities are $I_{1}=I_{0}$, say, $I_{2}=4 I_{0}$. For double-slit interference the resultant amplitude is given by the vector sum of $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ making an angle $\delta$ equal to the phase difference. Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
I &=I_{1}+I_{2}+2 \sqrt{I_{1} I_{2}} \cos \delta \\
&=I_{0}+4 I_{0}+4 I_{0} \cos (2 \pi d \sin \theta / \lambda)=5 I_{0}+4 I_{0} \cos (2000 \pi \sin \theta),
\end{aligned}
$$

where $d$ is the separation of the centres of the slits, being equal to $1000 \lambda$, $\sin \theta \approx \frac{x}{L}, x$ being the distance on the screen from the centre of the interference pattern. As $L>x, \sin \theta \simeq \theta$ and adjacent maxima occur when $2000 \pi \delta \theta=2 \pi$, or $\delta \theta=\frac{1}{1000}$, giving

$$
\delta x=L \delta \theta=\frac{L}{1000} .
$$

(b) The diffraction intensity distribution due to a slit of width $w$ is given by $\sim\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2}$, where $\beta=\frac{\pi w}{\lambda} \sin \theta$. Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
&I_{1}=I_{0}\left(\sin \beta_{1} / \beta_{1}\right)^{2}, \quad \text { where } \beta_{1}=\pi w_{1} \sin \theta / \lambda=20 \pi \sin \theta, \\
&I_{2}=4 I_{0}\left(\sin \beta_{2} / \beta_{2}\right)^{2}, \quad \text { where } \beta_{2}=\pi w_{2} \sin \theta / \lambda=40 \pi \sin \theta .
\end{aligned}
$$

The first zeros occur at angular distances from the centre of $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$ given by

$$
20 \pi \sin \theta_{1} \simeq 20 \pi \theta_{1}=\pi \text {, or } \theta_{1}=\frac{1}{20} \text {, and } \theta_{2}=\frac{1}{40} \text {. }
$$

Hence the angular widths of the central maxima are

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \theta_{1}=2 \theta_{1} &=\frac{1}{10}, \\
\Delta \theta_{2} &=\frac{1}{20} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The corresponding widths are then

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\Delta x_{1}=L \theta_{1}=L / 10, \\
&\Delta x_{2}=L \theta_{2}=L / 20 .
\end{aligned}
$$

(c) The width of the overlap of these central maxima is $L / 20$, and the number of fringes is $(\mathrm{L} / 20) /(\mathrm{L} / 1000)=50$.

(d) The intensity maximum and minimum in the center of the pattern are given by $\cos \delta=1$ and $\cos \delta=-1$ respectively. Hence we have the ratio

$$
\frac{I_{\max }}{I_{\min }}=\frac{9 I_{0}}{I_{0}}=9 .
$$

(e) Taking diffraction effect into account gives the fields produced by $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ respectively as

$$
\begin{aligned}
&E_{1}=E_{0}\left(\sin \beta_{1} / \beta_{1}\right), \\
&E_{2}=2 E_{0}\left(\sin \beta_{2} / \beta_{2}\right),
\end{aligned}
$$

where $E_{0}$ is a constant.

With $\beta_{2}=2 \beta_{1}$, we have

$$
E=\left|\mathbb{E}_{1}+\mathbb{E}_{2}\right|=E_{0} \frac{\sin \beta_{1}}{\beta_{1}}(5+4 \cos \delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$

The intensity is therefore

$$
I(x)=I_{0}\left(\frac{\sin \frac{20 \pi x}{L}}{\frac{20 \pi x}{L}}\right)^{2}\left(5+4 \cos \frac{2000 \pi x}{L}\right)
$$

\section{2}

A thin piece of glass of thickness $\delta$, index of refraction $n$, is placed between one of the slits and the screen perpendicular to the light path, and the intensity at the central point $P$ is required as a function of thickness $\delta$.

What is the intensity at point $P$ as a function of $\delta ?$}

(Columbia)

\section{Solution:}

(a) For the double slit system, the intensity at a point on the screen is given by

$$
I \sim 4 a^{2}\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2} \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\varphi}{2}\right),
$$

where $a$ is the amplitude due to each individual slit, $4 a^{2}(\sin \beta / \beta)^{2}$ is the single-slit diffraction term, $\cos ^{2}(\varphi / 2)$ is the interference term, with

$$
\varphi=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}(n-1) \delta
$$

being the phase difference between the waves originated from the two slits, $n$ the index of refraction of the glass and $\delta$ the thickness of the glass plate. The intensity at the central point $P$ is given by $\beta \rightarrow 0$, for which $\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta} \rightarrow 1$, as

or

$$
I \sim 4 a^{2} \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{\lambda}(n-1) \delta\right),
$$

$$
I=I_{0} \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{\lambda}(n-1) \delta\right) \text {, }
$$

where $I_{0}$ is the intensity at $P$ for $\delta=0$.

(b) For $\pi \delta(n-1) / \lambda=(2 k+1) \pi / 2, k=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$, or

$$
\delta=\frac{(2 k+1) \lambda}{2(n-1)},
$$

the intensity at $P$ would be a minimum. In particular for $k=0$, we get

$$
\delta_{\min }=\frac{\lambda}{2(n-1)} .
$$

Note that the intensity at the minima will not be exactly zero as the slits have finite width. (c) As the width of one of the slits is increased to $2 w$, the amplitude due to the slit will become $2 a$. The intensity of the resultant wave at $P$ is now given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
I & \sim a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+2 a_{1} a_{2} \cos \varphi \\
&=a^{2}+(2 a)^{2}+2 a \cdot(2 a) \cos \varphi \\
&=a^{2}(5+4 \cos \varphi)=a^{2}[5+4 \cos (2 \pi(n-1) \delta / \lambda)] .
\end{aligned}
$$

For $\delta=0$, the intensity at $P$ is the maximum $I_{0}^{\prime}=9 a^{2}$. Comparing with (a), we have

$$
\frac{I_{0}^{\prime}}{I_{0}}=\frac{9 a^{2}}{4 a^{2}}=2.25 .
$$

\section{3}

A Young double-slit interferometer receives light from a stellar object which is focused at the plane shown in Fig. 2.23.

(a) Determine the interference pattern as a function of $x$.

(b) If the interferometer is pointed at a stellar object subtending, at the earth, an angle greater than $\theta_{\min }$, the pattern disappears. Explain why and find $\theta_{\min }$.

(Columbia)

Fig. $2.23$

Solution:

(a) Let the width of each slit be $a$ and the angular sise of the star be $\theta$. To good approximation the intensity distribution of the interference pattern is given by the result of Question 2007:

$$
I(x, \theta) \sim\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2}\left(1+\frac{\sin \alpha}{\alpha} \cos \gamma\right)
$$

where

$$
\beta=\frac{\pi a x}{\lambda f}, \alpha=\frac{\pi d \theta}{\lambda}, \gamma=\frac{2 \pi d x}{\lambda f} .
$$

(b) The visibility of the pattern is given by

$$
V=\frac{I_{\max }-I_{\min }}{I_{\max }+I_{\min }},
$$

where $I_{\max }$ and $I_{\min }$ are the intensities at the neighboring maximum and minimum respectively. Thus

$$
V=\frac{\sin \alpha}{\alpha} .
$$

As $\theta$ increases from 0 to $\theta_{\min }, V$ decreases from 1 to 0 , where $\theta_{\min }$ is given by

$$
\frac{\pi d \theta_{\min }}{\lambda}=\pi \text {, or } \theta_{\min }=\frac{\lambda}{d} .
$$

The pattern also appears when $\theta \geq \theta_{\min }$. Actually, beyond $\theta_{\min }$ the pattern may reappear and then disappear again many times but the fluctuation of $V$ around 0 becomes smaller and smaller.

\section{4}

A two-slit diffraction system is illuminated normally with coherent light of wavelength $\lambda$. The separation between the slits is $a$. The intensity of light detected at a distant screen (far compared with $a$ ), when one of the slits is covered, is $I_{0}$.

(a) For the situation where both slits are open, calculate and sketch the response of the detector as a function of the angle $\theta$, where $\theta$ is measured away from the normal to the system.

(b) Now assume that the slit separation "jitters" such that the spacing $a$ between the slits changes on a timescale large compared to the period of the light but short compared with the response time of the intensity detector. Assume that the spacing $a$ has a Gaussian probability distribution of width $\Delta$ and average value a. Assume that $\bar{a} \gg \Delta \gg \lambda$. Without performing a detailed calculation, sketch the intensity pattern measured by the detector for this situation.

Fig. $2.25$

\section{Solution:}

(a) Assume the widths of the slits are much smaller than $\lambda$, then one need not consider the diffraction produced by each slit. Only the interference between beams from different slits needs to be considered.

The amplitudes of the waves at a point on the screen produced individually by the slits are given by

$$
E_{1}=A e^{i k r_{1}}
$$

and

$$
E_{2}=A e^{i k r_{2}}=A e^{i k r_{1}} \cdot e^{i k a \sin \theta},
$$

where $k=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}, r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are the distances between the point and the two slits. The resultant intensity is

$$
\begin{aligned}
I \sim E E^{*} &=2 A^{2}[1+\cos (k a \sin \theta)] \\
&=4 A^{2} \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

and is plotted in Fig. 2.24.

(b) Since the slit separation changes on a time-scale small compared with the response time of the intensity detector, the intensity pattern will reflect the probability distribution of the slit separation which is Gaussian:

$$
p(a)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \Delta} e^{-\frac{(a-a)^{2}}{2 \Delta^{2}}} .
$$

Thus the intensity detected will distribute as

$$
I \sim p(a) \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right) .
$$

Hence the positions of the principal maxima remain fixed, while the contrast or visibility of the intensity pattern decreases as $\theta$ increases, (Fig. 2.25).

\section{5}

In one or two short paragraphs, describe the conditions under which an observer might or might not be able to directly sense interference effects created by separated independent pairs of light or sound generators.

$(U C$, Berkeley)

\section{Solution:}

An observer might be able to directly sense interference effects if two independent light or sound generators are in phase during a period of time which is longer than the response time of human sense organs (eyes or ears) and the powers of the two generators are comparable to each other.

Common light emitters and sound generators do not satisfy the former condition. So one seldom observes directly interference effects. For laser light of high coherence, one can directly see interference effects.

\section{6}

(a) Distinguish between Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffractions in terms of the experimental arrangement used.

(b) Show schematically an experimental arrangement which will allow Fraunhofer diffraction to be observed.

(c) Draw the pattern observed on a screen of the Fraunhofer diffraction from a single slit (width $a$ ) and from a double slit (widths $a$, separation $d$ ). Point out the distinguishing features of each pattern.

(d) Calculate the interference pattern that would be obtained if three equally spaced slits were used instead of two in Young's experiment (screen far from slits).

$(S U N Y, B u f f a l o)$ 

\section{Solution:}

(a) Fraunhofer diffraction is the diffraction observed when the source of light and the screen on which the pattern is observed (Fig. 2.26) are effectively at infinite distances from the aperture causing the diffraction so that both the incident and diffracted beams can be regarded as plane waves. Experimentally the light from a source is rendered parallel with a lens and is focused on the screen with another lens placed behind the aperture. Fresnel diffraction is that observed when either the source or the sereen, or both, are at finite distances from the aperture. Here the wave fronts are divergent instead of plane. No lenses are necessary in the observation of Fresnel diffraction.

Fig. $2.26$

(b) A light source is located on the front focal plane of a convex lens $L_{1}$, the light emerging from which is in the form of plane waves. The waves fall on a diffracting aperture, behind which a convex lens $L_{2}$ is located. On the back focal plane of $L_{2}$ is an obsersvation screen, on which the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern appears. See Fig. 2.27.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-093.jpg?height=283&width=679&top_left_y=1297&top_left_x=361)

Fig. $2.27$

(c) The diffraction intensity distribution from a single-slit of width a is given by

$$
I \sim A_{0}^{2}\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2}
$$

where $\beta=\pi a \sin \theta / \lambda$. The intensity distribution is shown in Fig. 2.28.

The features are as follows. 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-094.jpg?height=361&width=670&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=440)

(b)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-094.jpg?height=190&width=830&top_left_y=624&top_left_x=360)

Fig. $2.28$

1. The principal maximum occurs when $\theta$ approaches zero, so that $(\sin \beta / \beta)^{2}$ becomes unity. Its angular half-width at the aperture is given by $\sin \beta=\pi$ or $\theta \simeq \lambda /$ a. Thus the smaller the width, the wider will be the diffraction pattern.

2. The diffraction intensity is zero at angles (except 0 ) for which $\sin \beta=$ 0 , or $\sin \theta=k \lambda / a(k=1,2, \ldots)$. Between two neighboring minima there is a weak maximum, the intensity of which is much less than that of the principal maximum, attenuating as $k$ increases.

3. The angular width of the central principal intensity maximum is twice that of the other maxima.

The intensity distribution diffracted by $N$ slits, width $a$ and spacing $d$ is given by

$$
I=A_{0}^{2}\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2} \times\left(\frac{\sin N \gamma}{\sin \gamma}\right)^{2}
$$

where $\beta=\pi a \sin \theta / \lambda, \gamma=\pi d \sin \theta / \lambda \cdot(\sin \beta / \beta)^{2}$ is called the single-slit diffraction factor, $(\sin N \gamma / \sin \gamma)^{2}$ the multi-slit interference factor.

For $N=2$, the intensity distribution diffracted by a double-slit is given by

$$
I=4 A_{0}^{2}(\sin \beta / \beta)^{2} \cos ^{2} \gamma .
$$

The intensity pattern diffracted by a double-slit of spacing $d(d=3 a$, for instance) is shown in Fig. 2.29, which is the intensity pattern of doubleslit interference (Fig. 2.28(b)) modulated by the envelope of the intensity pattern of single-slit diffraction. (Fig. 2.28(a)). The maxima occur if $\gamma=$ $m \pi$ or $\sin \theta=m \lambda / d$, where $m=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$ is the order of interference. The minima of the interference pattern are given by $\sin \theta=\left(m+\frac{1}{2}\right) \lambda / d$. The diffraction minima are given by $\sin \theta=k \lambda / a(k=\pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots)$ at which the diffraction factor becomes sero. An effect known as missing orders can occur if $d / a=m / k$ is a rational fraction. Then the $m$-th interference maximum and the $k$-th diffraction minimum (sero) correspond to the same $\theta$ value and that maximum will not appear, or at least reduced to a very low intensity. For $d=3 a$, the third, sixth, ninth, ... orders will not appear, as seen in Fig. 2.29.

Fig. $2.28$

(d) The 3-slit diffraction intensity is given by

$$
I=A_{0}^{2} \frac{\sin ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)}{\left(\frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)^{2}} \frac{\sin ^{2}\left(\frac{3 \pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)}{\sin ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi d \ln \theta}{\lambda}\right)} .
$$

\section{7}

Show that Fresnel half-period sones for a circular aperture all have equal areas.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:} ted here.

The proof can be found in most optics textbooks and is therefore omit- 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-096.jpg?height=412&width=466&top_left_y=196&top_left_x=542)

Fig. $2.30$

A circular aperture of radius $a$ is uniformly illuminated by plane waves of wavelength $\lambda$. Let the $z$-axis coincide with the aperture axis, with $z=0$ at the aperture, and with the incident flux travelling from negative values of $z$ toward $z=0$ (Fig. 2.30).

Find the values of $z$ at which the intensity of illumination on the axis is sero (Fresnel diffraction). You may assume $z>a$.

$(M I T)$

\section{Solution:}

Fresnel's half-period zone construction shows that if the number of halfperiod zones is even for a point on the axis the intensity of illumination at this point will be zero. As

or

$$
N=\frac{a^{2}}{\lambda z},
$$

$$
z=\frac{a^{2}}{\lambda N},
$$

the intensity at the point $z$ will be zero for $N=2,4,6, \ldots$

\section{9}

Monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ is normally incident on a screen with a circular hole of radius $R$. Directly behind the hole on the axis the intensity of light vanishes at some points; how far from the screen is the most distant point at which the light vanishes? Assume $\lambda / R \ll 1$.

(Wiscondin) 

\section{Solution:}

The most distant point at which the light vanishes is at $R^{2} /(2 \lambda)$ from the screen.

\section{0}

Light of wavelength $\lambda$ and intensity $I_{0}$ is incident perpendicularly onto (a) an opaque circular disk of radius $R$, (b) an opaque screen with a circular hole of radius $R$.

In each case, find the intensity of the light at a distance $L$ behind the obstacle, on the path passing through the center of the circle. Take $L \gg R$.

(Wisconsin)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-097.jpg?height=304&width=518&top_left_y=788&top_left_x=441)

Fig. 2.31

Solution:

Let us first consider the diffraction by the hole (see Fig. 2.31). The field at $P$ on the axis, distance $L$ from the hole, is represented by

$$
A=A_{0} \iint \frac{K e^{i k r} d s}{r},
$$

where $K$ is the obliquity factor, which can be taken as $1 / i \lambda$ for $L \gg R, k=$ $2 \pi / \lambda$ is the wave number, $d s$ is the annular elemental area of radius $\rho$, $d s=2 \pi \rho d \rho$, and

$$
r=\sqrt{\rho^{2}+L^{2}}
$$

is the distance between $P$ and ds. As $L \gg R \geq \rho, r$ can be taken as $L$ in the denominator and $L\left(1+\rho^{2} / 2 L^{2}\right)$ in the exponent, which is the Fresnel approximation. We then have

$$
\begin{aligned}
A &=\frac{A_{0}}{i \lambda} \frac{e^{i k L}}{L} \int_{0}^{R} 2 \pi \rho e^{i k \rho^{2} / 2 L} d \rho \\
&=A_{0}\left[e^{i k L}-e^{i k\left(L+\frac{\pi^{2}}{2 L}\right)}\right],
\end{aligned}
$$

where we have omitted some constant factor. The intensity is therefore

$$
I \sim|A|^{2}=4 I_{0} \sin ^{2}\left(k R^{2} / 4 L\right),
$$

where $I_{0}=\left|A_{0}\right|^{2}$.

For diffraction by the opaque circular disk, the field $A^{\prime}$ at $P$ is given by Babinet's principle

$$
A+A^{\prime}=A_{\infty}=A_{0} e^{i k L},
$$

where $A$ is the field at $P$ due to diffraction by the circular hole above, $A_{\infty}$ is the field due to diffraction by a hole of infinite sire. Thus

giving

$$
A^{\prime}=A_{0} e^{i k L}-A=A_{0} \exp \left[i k\left(L+\frac{R^{2}}{2 L}\right)\right]
$$

$$
I^{\prime} \sim\left|A^{\prime}\right|^{2}=I_{0},
$$

i.e., the intensity is nearly the same as that without any diffracting screen provided the opaque obstacle is small.

2081

Monochromatic parallel light impinges normally on an opaque screen with a circular hole of radius $r$ and is detected on the axis a distance $L$ from the hole. The intensity is observed to oscillate as $r$ is increased from 0 to $\infty$.

(a) Find the radius $r_{\mathrm{a}}$ of the hole for the first maximum.

(b) Find the radius $r_{b}$ of the hole for the first minimum.

(c) Find the ratio of the intensity for $r=r_{\mathbf{a}}$ to the intensity for $r=r_{\infty}$.

(d) Suppose the screen is replaced by on opaque disk of radius $r_{\mathrm{a}}$. What is the intensity?

(Chicago)

Solution:

For parallel incident light and a point on the axis distance $L$ from the hole, the radii of the Fresnel zones are given by

$$
r_{k}=\sqrt{k \lambda L}, \quad(k=1,2,3, \ldots) .
$$

(a) For the first maximum, $k=1, r_{\mathrm{a}}=r_{1}=\sqrt{\lambda L}$. (b) For the first minimum, $k=2, r_{b}=r_{2}=\sqrt{2 \lambda L}$.

(c) As $k$ approaches infinity, the total amplitude is

as

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_{\infty}=& A_{1}-A_{2}+A_{3}-A_{1}+\ldots=\frac{A_{1}}{2}+\left(\frac{A_{1}}{2}-A_{2}+\frac{A_{3}}{2}\right) \\
&+\left(\frac{A_{3}}{2}-A_{4}+\frac{A_{5}}{2}\right)+\ldots \approx \frac{A_{1}}{2},
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
&A_{2} \approx \frac{1}{2}\left(A_{1}+A_{3}\right), A_{4} \approx \frac{1}{2}\left(A_{3}+A_{5}\right), \ldots, \\
&I_{\infty} \sim A_{\infty}^{2}=A_{1}^{2} / 4 \sim I_{1} / 4,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $I_{1}$ is the intensity produced by the first half-period sone at the point in question. In other words, the ratio of the intensity for $r=r_{\mathrm{s}}$ to the intensity for $r=r_{\infty}$ is 4 .

(d) From Babinet's principle, the sum of field amplitudes $A_{1}$ and $A_{1}^{\prime}$ produced by a pair of complementary screens equals $A_{\infty}$, amplitude of the unscreened wave, i.e., $A_{1}+A_{1}^{\prime}=A_{\infty} . A_{1}^{\prime}$ is the field amplitude produced by an opaque disk of radius $r_{\mathrm{a}}$. Therefore the intensity is

$$
I^{\prime} \sim\left(A_{\infty}-A_{1}\right)^{2} \sim I_{1} / 4=I_{\infty} .
$$

\section{2}

An opaque sheet has a hole in it of $0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ radius. If plane waves of light $(\lambda=5000 \AA)$ fall on the sheet, find the maximum distance from this sheet at which a screen must be placed so that the light will be focused to a bright spot. What is the intensity of this spot relative to the intensity with the opaque sheet removed? Indicate how you arrived at each answer.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

The maximum distance $r$ of the screen from the hole for which the light will be focused to a bright spot is that for which the area of the hole corresponds to the first Fresnel zone only, and is given by

$$
\rho_{1}^{2}=\lambda r,
$$

where $\rho$ is the radius of the hole. Hence

$$
r=\frac{\rho_{1}^{2}}{\lambda}=\frac{0.5^{2}}{5000 \times 10^{-7}}=500 \mathrm{~mm} .
$$

Without the opaque screen, the number of the Fresnel zones will approach infinity. The total amplitude is then

hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
A &=A_{1}-A_{2}+A_{3}-\ldots \ldots \\
&=\frac{A_{1}}{2}+\left(\frac{A_{1}}{2}-A_{2}+\frac{A_{3}}{2}\right)+\left(\frac{A_{3}}{2}-A_{4}+\frac{A_{5}}{2}\right)+\ldots \\
& \approx \frac{A_{1}}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
I^{\prime} \sim A_{1}^{2} / 4 \text {, i.e., } I^{\prime}=I_{1} / 4
$$

Thus the intensity is now $1 / 4$ that before the opaque sheet is removed.

2083

A plane wave of microwaves having $\lambda=1 \mathrm{~cm}$ is incident on an opaque screen containing a circular aperture of adjustable radius. A detector having a very small sensitive area is located on the axis of the aperture 1 meter behind it. If the radius of the aperture is gradually increased from sero, at what value of the radius does the detector response reach its first maximum? Its second minimum after the first maximum? At the latter radius find the positions of the maxima and minima along the axis.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

For incident plane waves the radii of the Fresnel zones are given by $\rho_{m}=\sqrt{m r_{0} \lambda}, m=1,2,3, \ldots$ where $r_{0}$ is the distance of the detector from the aperture. For the first maximum, $m=1, \rho_{1}=0.1 \mathrm{~m}$.

For $m=4$, when the hole area corresponds to 4 Fresnel sones, the detector response reaches its second minimum. Thus

$$
\rho_{4}=\sqrt{4 r_{0} \lambda}=0.2 \mathrm{~m} .
$$

At the radius $0.2 \mathrm{~m}$, the positions of the maxima and minima can be found from the formula

$$
\rho_{4}=\sqrt{k r_{k} \lambda},(k=1,2,3, \ldots \ldots),
$$

or $r_{k}=p_{4}^{2} /(k \lambda)$ For $k$ an odd integer, $r_{1}=4 \mathrm{~m}, r_{3}=1.33 \mathrm{~m}, r_{5}=0.8 \mathrm{~m} .$. the maxima occur; for $k$ an even integer, $r_{2}=2 \mathrm{~m}, r_{4}=1 \mathrm{~m}, r_{6}=0.67 \mathrm{~m}, \ldots$ the minima occur.

\section{4}

\section{A Fresnel sone plate is made by dividing a photographic image into 5 separate sones.}

The first sone consists of an opaque circular disc of radius $r_{1}$. The second is a concentric transparent ring from $r_{1}$ to $r_{2}$ followed by an opaque ring from $r_{2}$ to $r_{3}$, a second transparent ring from $r_{3}$ to $r_{4}$ and a final sone from $r_{4}$ to infinity that is black. The radii $r_{1}$ to $r_{4}$ are in the ratio $r_{1}: r_{2}: r_{3}: r_{4}=1: \sqrt{2}: \sqrt{3}: \sqrt{4}$.

The sone plate is placed in the $x-y$ plane and illuminated by plane monochromatic light waves of wavelength $5,000 \AA$. The most intense spot of light behind the plate is seen on the axis of the sone plate 1 meter behind it.
(a) What is the radius $r_{1}$ ?
(b) What is the intensity at that spot in terms of the intensity of the incident wave?
(c) Where can you expect to find the intensity maxima of the axis?
(UC, Berkeley)

\section{Solution:}

(a) The focal lengths of the sones are given by

$$
f=\frac{r_{j}^{2}}{j \lambda} .
$$

For $j=1, f=1 \mathrm{~m}, \lambda=5000 \AA$, we have $r_{1}=0.707 \mathrm{~mm}$.

(b) The resultant amplitude produced by the second and the fourth transparent sones is

$$
A=A_{2}+A_{4} \approx 2 A_{1}
$$

where $A_{1}$ is the field amplitude produced by the first sone alone if it were tranoparent. As $A_{1}=2 A_{\infty}, A_{\infty}$ being the field at the point with the plate removed, we obtain

$$
I \sim A^{2} \approx 16 A_{\infty}^{2} \sim 16 I_{0} .
$$

by

\section{(c) The Fresnel zone plate has a series of focal lengths which are given}

$$
f_{m}=\frac{1}{m}\left(\frac{r_{1}^{2}}{\lambda}\right)
$$

where $m$ is an odd number. So we can expect to find intensity maxima on the axis at points distance $1 / 3 \mathrm{~m}, 1 / 5 \mathrm{~m}, 1 / 7 \mathrm{~m}, \ldots$ from the zone plate.

\section{5}

Light from a monochromatic point source of wavelength $\lambda$ is focused to a point image by a Fresnel half-period sone plate having 100 open odd half-period sones $(1,3,5, \ldots 199)$ with all even sones opaque. Compare the image dot intensity with that at the same point for the zone plate removed, and for a lens of the same focal length and diameter corresponding to 200 half-period sones of the sone plate. Assume the diameter of the opening is small compared to the distance from the source and the image.

(Columbia)

\section{Solution:}

Let the amplitudes of the light from the half-period sones be $A_{1}, A_{3}, \ldots$ $A_{199}$. As all of them are approximately the same as $A_{1}$, the resultant amplitude for the sone plate is given by

$$
A=A_{1}+A_{3}+\ldots+A_{199} \approx 100 A_{1} .
$$

The intensity is then

$$
I \sim A^{2} \sim 10^{4} \times A_{1}^{2} .
$$

When we substitute a lens of the same focal length for the zone plate, all the waves of amplitudes $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots A_{109}, A_{200}$ which are in phase are focused. So the resultant amplitude $A^{\prime}$ is

giving

$$
A^{\prime}=\sum_{i=1}^{200} A_{i} \approx 200 A_{1},
$$

$$
I^{\prime} \sim 4 \times 10^{4} \times A_{1}^{2} .
$$

Hence

$$
I^{\prime} / I=4 .
$$

The intensity with the lens is 4 times that with the zone plate. 

\section{6}

(a) A coherent plane wave of wavelength $\lambda$ is incident upon a screen with an infinitely long slit of width $d$. The beam's propagation direction is perpendicular to the slit and makes an angle $\theta$ with the normal to the screen (Fig. 2.32). Find the intensity distribution beyond the slit in the focal plane of a thin lens of focal length $f$. [Assume the lens, diameter infinite.]

Fis. $2.33$

\section{Solution:}

(a) Using the coordinates shown in Fig. 2.34, the incident plane wave is ropresented by

$$
e^{\frac{i 2 \pi}{i} y^{\prime} \sin \theta} .
$$

The amplitude distribution in the focal plane of the lens is the amount of Fraunhofer diffraction by the slit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A & \propto \int_{-\frac{1}{2}}^{\frac{d}{2}} e^{i \frac{2 x}{\lambda} \sin \theta y^{\prime}} e^{-i 2 \pi f_{y} y^{\prime}} d y^{\prime} \\
& \propto \frac{\sin \left[\pi\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{\lambda}-f_{y}\right) d\right]}{\pi\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{\lambda}-f_{y}\right) d}
\end{aligned}
$$

with

Hence

$$
f_{y}=\frac{y}{\lambda f} .
$$

$$
I=a^{2} \frac{\sin ^{2}\left[\pi\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{\lambda}-\frac{y}{\lambda f}\right) d\right]}{\left[\pi\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{\lambda}-\frac{y}{\lambda f}\right) d\right]^{2}}
$$

where $a=$ constant. (a)

Fig. $2.34$

The principal maximum is given by $\frac{\sin \theta}{\lambda}-\frac{y}{\lambda f}=0$, or $y=f \sin \theta$. The minima are given by $\pi\left(\frac{\operatorname{lin} \theta}{\lambda}-\frac{y}{\lambda \jmath}\right) d=k \pi$, or $y=f \sin \theta-\frac{k \lambda f}{d}$, where $k=\pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$

(b) If we substitute a complementary slab of the same width $d$ for the screen with a slit, then according to Babinet's principle the intensity distribution in the focal plane remains unchanged except in the neighborhood of the central point $y=f \sin \theta$, as shown in Fig. $2.35$.

\section{7}

A plane wave with wavenumber $k$ is incident on a slit of width $a$. The slit is covered by a transparent wedge whose thickness is proportional to the distance from the top of the slit $(t=\gamma x)$, see Fig. 2.36. The index of refraction of the transparent wedge is $n$. The intensity of light at an angle $\theta$ is given by

$$
I \propto \sin ^{2}(\beta a) /(\beta a)^{2} .
$$

Derive an expression for $\beta$ in terms of $k, n, \gamma$ and $\theta$.

(Wisconsin)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-105.jpg?height=240&width=417&top_left_y=667&top_left_x=512)

Fig. $2.36$

\section{Solution:}

For a wedge with thickness $t=\gamma x$, the apex angle (in radians) is $\gamma$ to a good approximation. The angle of deviation of light passing through the wedge is then

$$
\delta=(n-1) \gamma .
$$

The intensity distribution due to single-slit diffraction is

$$
I \propto \frac{\sin ^{2}\left(\frac{1}{2} a k \sin \theta\right)}{\left(\frac{1}{2} a k \sin \theta\right)^{2}}
$$

where $k=2 \pi / \lambda$ and $\theta$ is the angle made by the diffracted light with the axis. For the slit covered by the wedge, we should substitute $\theta-\delta$ for $\theta$ in above formula, i.e.,

Hence

$$
I \propto \frac{\sin ^{2}\left\{\frac{1}{2} a k \sin [\theta-(n-1) \gamma]\right\}}{\left.\left\{\frac{1}{2} a k \sin \mid \theta-(n-1) \gamma\right]\right\}^{2}} .
$$

$$
\beta=\frac{1}{2} k \sin [\theta-(n-1) \gamma] .
$$

Thus the distribution remains that for the single-slit diffraction, except that the center is displaced by an angle $(n-1) \gamma$. 

\section{8}

Suppose you wish to observe reflection of laser light from the moon. Explain how you could use a large-aperture telescope lens or mirror, together with a laser and a short-focus lens to get a beam with very small divergence. What would the characteristics of the telescope lens and shortfocus lens have to be to get a beam of angular width $10^{-6}$ radian (first minimum on one side to first minimum on the other)? You may assume a rectangular aperture at the objective if you wish.

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $2.38$

\section{Solution:}

The divergence of a light beam is caused mainly by aperture diffraction, the angular divergence being inversely proportional to the radius of the aperture. Thus the divergence may be reduced by expanding the cross section of the beam. Figures $2.37$ and $2.38$ show the arrangements for achieving this purpose, using respectively a large-aperture lens and a mirror. They may be considered as telescope used in reverse.

The laser beam from the source has radius $r$ and hence angular divergence

$$
\theta_{1}=1.22 \frac{\lambda}{r} \text {. }
$$

We use a short-focus lens and a large aperture lens (or mirror) of radii and focal length $r, f$ and $R, F$ respectively. The angular divergence of light from the lens system is

$$
\theta_{2}=\frac{\theta_{1} f}{F}=\frac{1.22 \lambda f}{r F},
$$

while that from the mirror is

$$
\theta_{3}=\frac{1.22 \lambda}{R} .
$$

For $\theta_{2}, \theta_{3} \leq 10^{-6}$, if we assume $\lambda=5000 \AA$ and $r=6 \mathrm{~mm}$, we require $\frac{F}{f} \geq 100$ or $R \geq 0.6 \mathrm{~m}$. 

\section{9}

Set up on the lecture table is a demonstration that shows that it is possible to "measure the wavelength of a laser with a ruler". Make the obvious observations (please do not touch the equipment, the alignment is tricky), and use your data to calculate the wavelength of the laser.

(Princeton)

Fig. $2.39$

\section{Solution:}

As shown in Fig. 2.39, the laser beam falls on a thin wire of diameter $d$, which has been measured in advance. The diffraction fringes appear on a screen far behind the wire. We obtain the wavelength of the laser by measuring, with the ruler, the distance $L$ between the wire and the screen and the fringe spacing $\Delta$ on the screen, and using the relation $\lambda=d \Delta / L$.

\section{0}

A straight horisontal wire of diameter $0.01 \mathrm{~mm}$ is placed $30 \mathrm{~cm}$ in front of a thin lens with focal length $=+20 \mathrm{~cm}$.

(a) At what distance from the lens and with what magnification will a sharp image of the wire be focused?

(b) If collimated light is incident from the left, parallel to the optic axis, and a screen is placed at the back focal plane ( $20 \mathrm{~cm}$ behind) of the lens, what diffraction pattern will you observe? Be as quantitative as you $\operatorname{can}$.

(Princeton)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-107.jpg?height=227&width=435&top_left_y=1609&top_left_x=504)

Fis. $2.40$ 

\section{Solution:}

(a) The lens formula

$$
\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{f}
$$

with $u=30 \mathrm{~cm}, f=20 \mathrm{~cm}$ yields $v=60 \mathrm{~cm}$. The lateral magnification is $M=-\frac{v}{u}=-2$.

(b) As the incident light is collimated, Fraunhofer diffraction by the wire will take place. According to Babinet's principle, the pattern on the screen is, except for the central region, the same as that by a single slit of the same width, with the intensity distribution being given by

$$
I=I_{0}(\sin \beta / \beta)^{2},
$$

where $\beta=\pi d \sin \theta / \lambda \approx \pi d y /(f \lambda), y$ being the distance on the screen from the optical axis, and $d$ is the diameter of the wire.

\section{1}

Optical apodization is the process by which the aperture function of the system is altered to redistribute the energy in the diffraction pattern. To improve the resolution, consider the example where the transmission is modified by a cosine function, $\cos \pi x / b$, between $-b / 2$ and $+b / 2$, where $b$ is the slit width.

(a) Calculate the position of the $n$-th minimum of the single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, and compare it with the position of the $n$-th minimum of the unapodized slit of the same width $b$.

(b) Calculate the intensity which appears in the apodized diffraction pattern halfway between the $(n-1)$-th and $n$-th minima, which is near its $n$-th maximum. In each case, normalize your result to the intensity of the first maximum.

(UC, Berkeley)

\section{Solution:}

For the apodized aperture, the light amplitude of far-field diffraction is

or

$$
\begin{aligned}
A(\nu) &=\int_{-b / 2}^{b / 2} e^{i k x \sin \theta} \cos \left(\frac{\pi x}{b}\right) d x \\
&=\cos \left(\frac{\nu b}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\nu-\frac{\pi}{b}}-\frac{1}{\nu+\frac{\pi}{b}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

where

$$
I \sim A^{2}=\cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\nu b}{2}\right) \frac{4\left(\frac{\pi}{b}\right)^{2}}{\left[\nu^{2}-\left(\frac{\pi}{b}\right)^{2}\right]^{2}},
$$

$$
\frac{\nu b}{2}=\frac{\pi b}{\lambda} \sin \theta \text {, i.e., } \nu=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \sin \theta \text {. }
$$

The position of the $n$-th minimum is given by

or

$$
\frac{\nu b}{2}=\frac{\pi}{2}(2 n+1)
$$

$$
\sin \theta=\frac{\lambda}{2 b}(2 n+1) .
$$

For the unapodised aperture, the intensity of Fraunhofer diffraction is

$$
I \sim b^{2}\left(\frac{\sin \frac{\nu b}{2}}{\frac{\nu b}{2}}\right)^{2}
$$

and the position of the $n$-th minimum is given by $\frac{\nu b}{2}=n \pi$ or

Hence

$$
\sin \theta^{\prime}=\frac{n \lambda}{b} .
$$

$$
\sin \theta-\sin \theta^{\prime}=\frac{\lambda}{2 b} .
$$
is given, by

(b) The position of the $(n-1)$-th minimum for the apodized aperture

$$
\sin \theta=\frac{\lambda}{2 b}(2 n-1) .
$$

The position midway between the $(n-1)$-th and $n$-th minima is then given by $\sin \theta=n \lambda / b$. It is seen that the intensity is near the $n$-th maximum given by $\frac{\nu b}{2}=n \pi$. At this position the intensity is

$$
I \sim A^{2}=\frac{4}{\left(\frac{\pi}{b}\right)^{2}\left(4 n^{2}-1\right)^{2}} .
$$

Let the intensity of the first (central) maximum be $I_{0}$, which is given by $\frac{\nu b}{2}=0$. Therefore, for the apodised aperture,

$$
\frac{I}{I_{0}}=\frac{1}{\left(4 n^{2}-1\right)^{2}},
$$

while for the unapodized aperture, $I$ is given by $\frac{\nu b}{2}=n \pi-\frac{\pi}{2}$, so that

$$
\frac{I}{I_{0}}=\frac{4}{[(2 n-1) \pi]^{2}} .
$$

Figure 2.41 and Fig. 2.42 show that making use of the apodized aperture has put more energy into the central maximum at the expense of the secondary maxima.

Sunlight enters a large darkroom through a hole $2 \mathrm{~cm}$ square, which is covered with a parallel set of wires of width $w / 2$, spaced $w$ between centers. The sunlight falls on photographic plates at distances $d$ behind the hole (Fig. 2.43). The sun's angular diameter is about $0.01$ radian; describe the predominant character of the images for the followig cases:

Fig. $2.43$

\section{Solutlon:}

(a) As $d=w$, geometric optics applies. There are shadows of the square hole and the wires.

(b) As $w \ll d, \alpha=0.01 \ll 1$, Fraunhofer diffraction pattern occurs on the plate. The grating equation $w \sin \theta \simeq w \theta=m \lambda$, where $m$ is the order of diffraction, gives $\theta \approx \lambda / w=0.0005<\alpha$ for $\lambda=5000 \AA$. Thus the pattern diffracted by the wire set for different colors would overlap and give uniform intensity, i.e., no fringes, on the plate.

(c) For $w=0.005 \mathrm{~mm}, \theta \approx 0.1>\alpha$. Colorful diffraction patterns are seen on the plate.

\section{8}

(a) Consider the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern due to two unequal slits. Let $a$ and $b$ be the unequal slit widths and $c$ the distance between their centers. Derive an expression for the intensity of the pattern for any diffraction angle $\theta$, assuming the arrangement to be illuminated by perpendicular light of wavelength $\lambda$.

(b) Use your formula from (a) to obtain expressions for the pattern in the following special cases and make a sketch of those patterns:
(1) $a=b$,
(2) $a=0$.

(UC, Berkeley)

\section{Solution:}

(a) The diffraction amplitudes due to slits a and $b$ separately are

$$
\begin{aligned}
&A_{\mathrm{a}}=\frac{a \sin u}{u}, \quad u=\frac{1}{2} k a \sin \theta=\frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda}, \\
&A_{\mathrm{b}}=\frac{b \sin v}{v}, \quad v=\frac{1}{2} k b \sin \theta=\frac{\pi b \sin \theta}{\lambda} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The resultant intensity due to their interference is given by

$$
I(\theta)=\left|A_{\mathrm{a}}+A_{\mathrm{b}}\right|^{2}=A_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}+A_{\mathrm{b}}^{2}+2 A_{\mathrm{a}} A_{\mathrm{b}} \cos w,
$$

where

Hence

$$
w=\frac{2 \pi c \sin \theta}{\lambda} .
$$

$$
I(\theta)=a^{2} \frac{\sin ^{2} u}{u^{2}}+b^{2} \frac{\sin ^{2} v}{v^{2}}+2 a b \frac{\sin u}{u} \cdot \frac{\sin v}{v} \cos w .
$$

(b) (1) When $a=b$, then $u=v$, and

$$
I(\theta)=2 a^{2} \frac{\sin ^{2} v}{v^{2}}(1+\cos w)=4 a^{2} \frac{\sin ^{2} v}{v^{2}} \cos ^{2} \frac{w}{2} .
$$

(2) When $a=0$,

$$
I(\theta)=b^{2} \frac{\sin ^{2} v}{v^{2}} .
$$

\section{4}

Consider a monochromatic beam of light incident upon a single slit. Let the wavelength of the light be $\lambda$ and the slit width be $w=5 \lambda$ (Fig. 2.44).

(b) Calculate the positions of the first maximum and the first mini-

(c) It is now desired to uniformly phase-shift the light incident upon the upper (i.e., $y>w / 2$ ) half of the slit by exactly $180^{\circ}$. Design an idealized apparatus to accomplish this and sketch the resulting intensity pattern.

(d) Calculate the intensity vs. angle; give the position of the first minimum and an estimate of that for the first maximum.

(Chicago)

\section{Solution:}

(a) A Fraunhofer diffraction intensity pattern will be observed on a screen far from the slit as shown in Fig. $2.45$ as a function of the angle $\theta$ from the axis of symmetry.

Fig. $2.45$

\section{Analytically the intensity distribution is}

where

$$
I=I_{0} \frac{\sin ^{2} u}{u^{2}},
$$

$$
u=\frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{\lambda} .
$$

(b) The position of the first minimum is given by

Hence

$$
\frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{\lambda}=5 \pi \sin \theta=\pm \pi \text {. }
$$

$$
\theta=\arcsin \left(\pm \frac{1}{5}\right)=\pm 11.5^{\circ} .
$$

The position of the maxima are given by

or

$$
\frac{d I(u)}{d u}=0,
$$

$$
\tan u=u .
$$

This is a transcendental equation, the solution of which can be obtained graphically. Next to the central maximum for which $u=0$ the first maximum is given by

Hence

$$
u_{1}=\pm 1.43 \pi .
$$



$$
\theta_{1}=\arcsin \left(\pm \frac{1.43}{5}\right)=\pm 16.6^{\circ}
$$

(c) Attaching a transparent slab, refractive index $n$, of uniform thickness $d=\lambda /[2(n-1)]$ to the upper half of the slit would shift the phase of the upper half of the incident light by exactly $180^{\circ}$. This arrangement is equivalent to a double-slit apparatus with identical slit width $w / 2$ and a spacing between the centers of $w / 2$. The intensity distribution of the diffraction light is then

where

$$
I=I_{0} \frac{\sin ^{2} u^{\prime}}{u^{\prime 2}} \cdot \cos ^{2} v .
$$

Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
u^{\prime} &=\frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{2 \lambda}=\frac{5}{2} \pi \sin \theta, \\
v &=\frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{2 \lambda}+\frac{\pi}{2}=\frac{5}{2} \pi \sin \theta+\frac{\pi}{2} .
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
I=I_{0} \sin ^{4}\left(\frac{5}{2} \pi \sin \theta\right) /\left(\frac{5}{2} \pi \sin \theta\right)^{2} .
$$

Figure $2.46$ shows $\left(\frac{\sin u^{\prime}}{u^{\prime}}\right)^{2}, \cos ^{2} v$ ad $I$ as functions of $\sin \theta$.

Fig. $2.46$

(d) The first minimum occurs at $\sin \theta=0$, i.e., the center. The next minimum is given by

i.e., at

$$
\frac{5}{2} \pi \sin \theta=\pm \pi,
$$

or

$$
\sin \theta=\pm \frac{2}{5}
$$

$$
\theta=\arcsin \left(\pm \frac{2}{5}\right)=\pm 23.5^{\circ} .
$$

The position of the first maximum is approximately given by

Hence

$$
\sin \theta=\pm \frac{1}{5} .
$$

$$
\theta=\arcsin \left(\pm \frac{1}{5}\right)=\pm 11.5^{\circ} .
$$

Note that in this case, the central maximum disappears.

\section{5}

Sketch the interference pattern on a screen at the focal point of converging lens which arises from a double slit on which plane monochromatic light is incident. The two identical slits, having width $a$, are separated by a center-to-center distance $d$, and $d / a=5$.

\section{Solution:}

The intensity distribution on the screen is given by

where

$$
I=I_{0}\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2} \cos ^{2} \gamma,
$$

$$
\beta=\frac{\pi a \sin \theta}{\lambda}, \gamma=\frac{\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}=5 \beta .
$$

The interference pattern is shown in Fig. 2.47. Note that as $\frac{d}{a}=5$ orders $5,10,15 \ldots$ are missing.

\section{6}

A plane wave of light from a laser has a wavelength of $6000 \AA$. The light is incident on a double slit. After passing through the double slit the light falls on a screen $100 \mathrm{~cm}$ beyond the double slit. The intensity distribution of the interference pattern on the screen is shown (Fig. 2.48). What is the width of each slit and what is the separation of the two slits?

(Wiscconsin)

Fig. $2.48$

\section{Solution:}

For double-slit interference

$$
I \sim\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2} \cos ^{2} \gamma
$$

where

$$
\beta=\frac{\pi b \sin \theta}{\lambda}, \gamma=\frac{\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda} \text {, with } \sin \theta \approx \frac{y}{D},
$$

$b$ being the width of each slit, $d$ the separation of their centers, $D$ the distance between the screen and the double slit, and $\lambda$ the wavelength of the incident light. The minima are given by $\gamma=\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \pi, n=\pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$. Thus the fringe spacing $\Delta y$ is given by

$$
\Delta y=\frac{\Delta y}{\pi} \frac{\lambda D}{d}=\frac{\lambda D}{d} .
$$

Hence, for $\Delta y=1 \mathrm{~cm}$ as from Fig. 2.48,

$$
d=\lambda D / \Delta y=6 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~cm} .
$$

The pattern shows the missing order $d / b=4$, from which we get the width of each slit, $b=d / 4=1.5 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~cm}$.

\section{7}

Shown in Fig. 2.49 is the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern resulting from 3 slits.

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $2.49$

\section{Solution:}

The intensity distribution resulting from 3 slits is given by

where

$$
I \sim A_{0}^{2}\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2}\left[\frac{\sin (3 \gamma)}{\sin \gamma}\right]^{2},
$$

$$
\beta=\frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{\lambda}, \gamma=\frac{\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}, \sin \theta \approx \frac{x}{2 f} .
$$

As $\lim _{\gamma \rightarrow m \pi} \frac{\sin (3 \gamma)}{\operatorname{in} \gamma} \rightarrow 3, m=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$, the principal maximum occurs when $\theta=0$. The first maximum occurs when $\frac{\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}=\pi$. The fringe spacing is given by $\Delta \gamma=\pi$, or $D \approx f \sin \theta$, i.e.,

$$
D \approx \frac{\lambda f}{d} .
$$

The first minimum of the diffraction intensity occurs when $\frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{\lambda}=\pi$, or

$$
x=\frac{2 \lambda f}{w} .
$$

The first and second interference minima occur when $\frac{3 \pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}=\pi$ and $2 \pi$ respectively. The first subsidiary maximum will occur between them, i.e., when

$$
3 \gamma \approx 3 \pi / 2 \text {, or } \sin \theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{2 d} \text {. }
$$

Thus gives

$$
I_{1} \sim A_{0}^{2} \cdot\left(\frac{\sin \frac{\pi w}{2 d}}{\frac{\pi w}{2 d}}\right)^{2} \cdot\left(\frac{\sin \frac{3 \pi}{2}}{\sin \frac{\pi}{2}}\right)^{2}=A_{0}^{2}\left(\frac{\sin \frac{\pi w}{2 d}}{\frac{\pi w}{2 d}}\right)^{2},
$$

We also have for the central maximum, for which $\beta=\gamma=0$,

$$
I_{0} \sim 9 A_{0}^{2} .
$$

Hence $I_{0} / I_{1} \approx 9$ if $w / d \ll 1$.

The diffraction pattern below (Fig. 2.51) is produced on a screen by light passing through three distant slits of width $w$ and spacing $d$ (Fig. 2.50). How will the envelope width $A$ and the separation of the peaks $B$ change if:
(a) The slit width $w$ is increased?
(b) The slit spacing $d$ is increased?
(c) The wavelength of the light is increased?

The amplitudes of the E-field arriving at point 2 on the screen are represented on the right by three equal vectors summed with the appropriate phases for this position (Fig. 2.52). As shown, they add to zero, which is why there is zero intensity at this point on the screen. Make a similar vector diagram showing the relative phases:

Solution:

(a) The light intensity distribution on the screen is represented by

$$
I \propto\left(\frac{\sin \frac{N \pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}}{\sin \frac{\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}}\right)^{2} \cdot\left(\frac{\sin \frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{\lambda}}{\frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{\lambda}}\right)^{2},
$$

where $N=3, \sin \theta \approx x / l$ ( $l$ is the focal length of a lens placed behind the slits or the distance between the screen and the slits).

From the formula we get the envelope width $A \propto \lambda l / w$ and the separation of the peaks $B \propto \lambda l / d$. Therefore we conclude:

(a) $A$ decreases and $B$ remains unchanged when $w$ is increased.

(b) A remains unchanged but $B$ decreases when $d$ is increased.

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $2.53$

\section{Solution:}

By the Huygens-Fresnel principle, the amplitude at a point on the screen is given by (for Fraunhofer diffraction)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\psi=& \frac{A_{0}}{a} e^{-i w t}\left[\int_{0}^{a} e^{i 2 \rho x} d x\right.\\
&\left.+\int_{d}^{d+a} e^{i(2 \rho x+\pi)} d x+\int_{2 d}^{2 d+a} e^{i 2 \rho x} d x\right] \\
=& A_{0} e^{-i w t} e^{i \rho a} \frac{\sin (\rho a)}{\rho a}\left(1-e^{i 2 \rho d}+e^{i 4 \rho d}\right) e^{i 2 \rho d} \\
=& A_{0} e^{i(\beta+4 \gamma-w t)} \frac{\sin \beta}{\beta} \frac{\cos (3 \gamma)}{\cos \gamma},
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\rho=\frac{\pi}{\lambda} \sin \theta, \beta=\rho a, \gamma=\rho d$. Thus

$$
I \sim\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2}\left[\frac{\cos (3 \gamma)}{\cos \gamma}\right]^{2} .
$$

(a) The first diffraction minimum occurs at

$$
\beta=\pm \pi, \text { i.e., } \theta=\pm \sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{\lambda}{a}\right)
$$

(b) The first interference minimum occurs at

$$
3 \gamma=\pm \frac{\pi}{2} \text {, i.e., } \theta=\pm \sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{\lambda}{6 d}\right) \text {. }

Consider an opaque screen with 5 equally spaced narrow slits (spacing $d$ ) and with monochromatic plane-wave light (wavelength $\lambda$ ) incident normally. Draw a sketch of the transmitted intensity vs. angle to the normal for $\theta=0$ to approximately $\theta=1 / 5$ radian. Assume $d / \lambda=10$. Your sketch should show the maxima and minima of intensity. Approximately what is the ratio in intensity of the least intense to the most intense peak? Approximately what is the angular distance of the first intense peak away from $\theta=0$ ?

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

For multiple-slit interference,

$$
I \propto\left(\frac{\sin \frac{N \delta}{2}}{\sin \frac{\delta}{2}}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{\sin \frac{5 \pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}}{\sin \frac{\pi d \ln \theta}{\lambda}}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{\sin (50 \pi \sin \theta)}{\sin (10 \pi \sin \theta)}\right)^{2} .
$$

For $\theta=0$ to $\frac{1}{5}$ rad we may take the approximation $\sin \theta \approx \theta$. Thus

$$
I \propto\left(\frac{\sin (50 \pi \theta)}{\sin (10 \pi \theta)}\right)^{2} .
$$

Therefore, intensity maxima occur when $10 \pi \theta=m \pi$, i.e., $\theta=m / 10$, where $m=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$. Intensity minima occur when $50 \pi \theta=n \pi$, i.e., $\theta=n / 50$ where $n$ is an integer such that $n \neq 0, \pm 5, \pm 10, \ldots$

Fig. 2.54 Figure $2.54$ shows the intensity distribution. The least intense peak is midway between two adjacent most intense peaks, for which

$$
\theta=\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{10}=0.05 \mathrm{rad} .
$$

The ratio in intensity of the least to the most intense peak is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{I(\theta=0.05)}{I(\theta=0)} &=\left(\frac{\sin (50 \pi \times 0.05)}{\sin (10 \pi \times 0.05)}\right)^{2} /\left(\frac{\sin (50 \pi \times 0)}{\sin (10 \pi \times 0)}\right)^{2} \\
&=\left[\frac{\sin (0.5 \pi)}{\sin (0.5 \pi)}\right]^{2} /\left[\lim _{\theta \rightarrow 0} \frac{\sin (50 \pi \varepsilon)}{\sin (10 \pi \varepsilon)}\right]^{2}=\frac{1}{25} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The sketch shows the angular distance of the first subsidiary peak from $\theta=0$ to be

$$
\frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{50}=0.03 \mathrm{rad} .
$$

\section{1}

A plane monochromatic wave (wavelength $\lambda$ ) is incident on a set of 5 slits spaced at a distance $d$ (Fig. 2.55). You may assume that the width of the individual slits is much less than $d$. For the resulting interference pattern, which is focused on a screen, compute either analytically or approximately the following. (Hint: The use of phasor diagrams may be helpful.)

Fig. $2.55$ 

\section{Solution:}

Each slit contributes an equal phasor $A_{0}$. These contributions can be added up in the phasor diagrams of Fig. 2.56. When $\theta=0$, all the five phasors are in phase and the resultant phasor is a straight line of $A=5 A_{0}$, representing the principal maximum (see Fig. $2.56(\mathrm{a})$ ). For the first minimum, the phasor diagram reduces to a pentagon (see Fig. $2.56$ (b)). Here we have $\delta=\frac{2 \pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}=\frac{2}{5} \pi$, i.e., $\theta \approx \sin \theta=\frac{\lambda}{5 d}$. For the first

$$
\delta=\frac{2 \pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}=\frac{\pi}{2} \text {, i.e., } \theta \approx \sin \theta=\frac{\lambda}{4 d} \text {. }
$$

(a) Angular width of central image is $\theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{b d}$.

(b) Intensity of subsidiary maximum relative to that of the principal maximum is about

$$
\left(\frac{A_{0}}{5 A_{0}}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{25} \text {. }
$$

(c) Angular position of the first subsidiary maximum is about $\theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{4 d}$.

\section{2}

A plane light wave of wavelength $\lambda$ is incident normally on a grating consioting of 6 identical parallel slits a distance $d$ apart.

(a) At what angles with the normal are the interference maxima?

(b) What is the angular width of the interference maxima, say from the maximum to the nearest null?

(c) What is the ratio of the intensity at an interference maximum to the intensity obtained for a single slit?

(d) Sketch the interference pattern as a function of angle. 

\section{Solution:}

(a) The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction is given by

$$
I=I_{0} \frac{\sin ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)}{\left(\frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)^{2}} \frac{\sin ^{2}\left(\frac{N \pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)}{\sin ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right)},
$$

where $N$ is the number of slits (in this case $N=6$ ), $w$ the width of a slit, $d$ the grating constant, $I_{0}$ the intensity in the $\theta=0$ direction due to any one slit.

The interference maxima occur when $\frac{\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}=k \pi,(k=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots)$, i.e., $\sin \theta=\frac{k \lambda}{d}$.

(b) Minima, of zero intensity, occur when

$$
\frac{N \pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}=m \pi,(m=\text { integer } \neq 0, \pm N, \pm 2 N, \ldots),
$$

i.e.,

$$
\frac{\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}=\pm \pi / N, \pm 2 \pi / N, \ldots,(N-1) \pi / N,(N+1) \pi / N, \ldots .
$$

Hence, the angular width of the interference maxima is $\Delta \theta \approx \lambda /(N d)$.

(c) $I(0)=N^{2} I_{0}=36 I_{0}$.

\section{8}

A transmission type diffraction grating having 250 lines/mm is illumi nated with visible light at normal incidence to the plane of the grooves. What wavelengths appear at a diffraction angle of $30^{\circ}$, and what colors are they?

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

The grating equation $d \sin \theta=k \lambda(k=$ integer $)$ gives for $d=1 / 250$ $\mathrm{mm}$ and $\theta=30^{\circ}$

$$
\lambda=20000 / k \quad \AA
$$

For visible light $(4000 \AA-7000 \AA)$ we get the following colors,

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\lambda_{1}=4000 \AA & (k=5), \text { violet, } \\
\lambda_{2}=5000 \AA & (k=4) \text {, green, } \\
\lambda_{3}=6670 \AA & (k=3) \text {, red. }
\end{array}
$$

\section{4}

A diffraction grating is ruled with $N$ lines spaced a distance $d$ apart. Monochromatic radiation of wavelength $\lambda$ is incident normally on the grating from the left; parallel radiation emerges from the grating to the right at an angle $\theta$ and is focused by a lens onto a screen.

(a) Derive an expression for the intensity distribution of the interference pattern observed on the screen as a function of $\theta$. Neglect the effect of diffraction due to finite slit width.

(b) The resolving power $\Delta \lambda / \lambda$ of the grating is a measure of the smallest wavelength difference which the grating can resolve. Using the Rayleigh criterion for resolution and the result of part (a), show that the resolvingpower in order $m$ is $\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}=\frac{1}{m N}$.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) The phase difference between rays coming from adjacent slits is $\phi=k d \sin \theta=(2 \pi / \lambda) d \sin \theta$. Thus, the total electric field at a point on the screen is a sum of $N$ terms:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E &=A e^{-i k r_{1}}\left[1+e^{-i \phi}+e^{-2 i \phi}+\ldots+e^{-(N-1) i \phi}\right] \\
&=A e^{-i k r_{1}} \cdot e^{-i(N-1) \phi / 2} \cdot \frac{\sin \frac{N \phi}{2}}{\sin \frac{\phi}{2}} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The intensity of the interference pattern is then

$$
I=I_{0} \frac{\sin ^{2}\left(\frac{N \pi}{\lambda} d \sin \theta\right)}{\sin ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{\lambda} d \sin \theta\right)} .
$$

(b) The Rayleigh criterion states that two spectral lines are just resolved when the maximum of one line coincides with the minimum of the other. Thus we require that light of wavelength $\lambda+\Delta \lambda$ forms its principal maximum of order $m$ at the same angle so that for the first minimum of wavelength $\lambda$ in that order. For order $m$, the principal maximum is given by $\frac{\phi}{2}=m \pi$ and the first minimum by $\frac{N \phi}{2}=N m \pi-\pi$. Hence we have

$$
\frac{N \pi}{\lambda+\Delta \lambda} d \sin \theta=N m \pi-\pi, \frac{N \pi}{\lambda} d \sin \theta=N m \pi .
$$

Taking the ratio we have

$$
\frac{\lambda+\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}=\frac{N m}{N m-1}, \text { or } \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}=\frac{1}{N m-1} \approx \frac{1}{N m} .
$$

(a) Calculate the intensity distribution of radiation diffracted from a grating whose rulings' width is negligible.

(b) Find the number of the subsidiary maxima between consecutive principal maxima.

(c) Are the intensities of these subsidiary maxima identical? Explain.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) $I=I_{0} \frac{\sin ^{2} N \varphi / 2}{\sin ^{2} \varphi / 2}$, where $\varphi=\frac{2 \pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}$ is the phase difference between two adjacent diffracted beeams of light, $d$ the grating constant, $N$ the total number of the rulings.

(b) $N-2$.

(c) The intensities of these subsidiary maxima are not identical, since between 0 and $\pi / 2$, as $\varphi / 2$ increases, the denominator increases while the numerator is a periodic function of $N \varphi / 2$. The intensities, being proportional to the quotients, do not remain constant. The intensity contribution for $N=6$ is shown in Fig. 2.58.

A useful optical grating configuration is to diffract light back along

(a) If there are $N$ grating lines per unit length, what wavelength(s) is (are) diffracted back at the incident angle $\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the normal to the grating and the incident direction?

(b) If two wavelengths are incident, namely $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{1} / 2$, is it possible to monochromatize the beam with this configuration? How?

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $2.89$

\section{Solution:}

(a) This kind of grating is known as blazed grating. As Fig. $2.59$ shows, the angle of incidence, $\theta$, is equal to $\alpha$, which is the angle between the groove plane and the grating plane. Each line has across it an optical path difference $\Delta=2 d \sin \theta$, where $d=1 / N$. Wavelengths for which the grating equation $m \lambda=2 d \sin \theta(m=1,2,3, \ldots)$ holds, i.e., $\lambda=2 d \sin \theta / m$, are diffracted back along the incident direction. (b) A grating which blazes a certain wavelength $\lambda_{1}$ will also blaze $\lambda_{1} / 2, \lambda_{1} / 3$, and so on. Thus this grating cannot separate wavelengths $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{1} / 2$. Hence it is not possible to monochromatise the beam containing wavelengths $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{1} / 2$.

\section{7}

The pattern of intensithy $I$ vs. position $x$ as shown in Fig. 2.60 below is measured on a wall 20 meters from a set of $N$ identical, parallel slits. Light of wavelength $\lambda=6000 \AA$ passes through the slits, each of which has width $a$, and which are spaced from each other by a distance $d$.

(a) What are the values of $N, a$ and $d$ ? (Give a reason for each answer.)

(b) Give an expression for the dashed curve which is the envelope for the large maxima, and explain its physical significance.

(Wisconsin)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-128.jpg?height=413&width=746&top_left_y=899&top_left_x=408)

Fig. $2.60$

\section{Solution:}

(a) The formula for the intensity distribution due to grating diffraction,

$$
I=I_{0}\left[\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin \theta\right)}{\frac{\pi \theta}{\lambda} \sin \theta}\right]^{2}\left[\frac{\sin \left(\frac{N \pi d}{\lambda} \sin \theta\right)}{\sin \left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda} \sin \theta\right)}\right]^{2},
$$

shows that there are $N-2$ subsidiary maxima between two adjacent principal maxima. As $N-2=2$ for the above pattern, we have $N=4$.

The first diffraction null occurs when $\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin \theta=\pi$. We have been given $\sin \theta=(2 \mathrm{~cm}) /(20 \mathrm{~m})$, hence

$$
a=\frac{\lambda}{\sin \theta}=0.6 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} .
$$

The firut principal maximum occurs when $\frac{\pi d}{\lambda} \sin \theta=\pi$. As we are given $\sin \theta=0.4 \mathrm{~cm} / 20 \mathrm{~m}$, we get

$$
d=\frac{\lambda}{\sin \theta}=3.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} \text {. }
$$

(b) The dashed curve is given by the single-slit diffraction factor

$$
\left[\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin \theta\right)}{\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin \theta}\right]^{2}
$$

and represents the intensity distribution of light diffracted from each slit. The intensity distribution for $N$-slit interference, as given by the multi-slit interference factor

$$
\left[\frac{\sin \left(\frac{N \pi d}{\lambda} \sin \theta\right)}{\sin \left(\frac{\pi d \operatorname{din} \theta}{\lambda}\right)}\right]^{2},
$$

is modulated by the envelope given by the single-slit diffraction intensity distribution.

\section{8}

A laser beam $\left(\lambda=6.3 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~cm}\right)$ is directed at grazing incidence onto a ateel machinist's ruler (which is calibrated in $1 / 16$ inch). The light reflects from the surface of the ruler and is projected onto a vertical wall 10 metere away (Fig. 2.61).

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-129.jpg?height=285&width=702&top_left_y=1295&top_left_x=341)

(a) Derive the condition on $\theta^{\prime}$ for interference maxima on the wall. Assume for simplicity that the laser beam is initially almost parallel to the ruler surface.

(b) What is the vertical separation on the wall of the seroth and first order apots of the pattern?

(Wisconsin) 

\section{Solution:}

(a) The optical path length difference (OPD) of the parallel light rays shown in Fig. $2.61$ is

$$
\Delta=d\left(\cos \theta-\cos \theta^{\prime}\right) \approx d\left(1-\cos \theta^{\prime}\right)
$$

as $\theta \approx 0$. Interference maxima occur when $\Delta=m \lambda$ ( $m$ is an integer), or

$$
\cos \theta^{\prime}=1-m \lambda / d .
$$

(b) When $m=0, \theta^{\prime}=0$. When $m=1, \theta_{1}^{\prime}=1-\lambda / d=0.9996$ taking $d=1$ division ( $\frac{1}{16}$ inch). The vertical separation on the wall between the zeroth and first order spots is

$$
x=l \cdot \tan \theta_{1}^{\prime}=0.28 \mathrm{~m} .

\section{9}

A sound field is created by an arrangement of identical line sources grouped into two identical arrays of $N$ sources each as shown (Fig. 2.62) below.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-130.jpg?height=327&width=452&top_left_y=1090&top_left_x=541)

Fig. $2.62$

All of the radiators lie in a plane perpendicular to the page, and produce waves of wavelength $\lambda$.

(a) Assuming $r \gg d, c, \lambda$ find the intensity of the sound produced as a function of the maximum intensity $I_{m}, \lambda, \theta, N, c$ and $d$, the distance between the centers of the arrays.

(b) By taking an appropriate limit, derive an approximate result for the interference pattern produced by two slits of width $a$ whose centers are a distance $d$ apart.

$(S U N Y, B u f f a l o)$ 

\section{Solution:}

by

(a) The intensity distribution produced by each array is represented

$$
I \sim\left(\frac{\sin \frac{N \delta}{2}}{\sin \frac{\delta}{2}}\right)^{2},
$$

where $\delta=2 \pi c \sin \theta / \lambda$. The expression

$$
I=I_{1}+I_{2}+2 \sqrt{I_{1} I_{2}} \cos \varphi
$$

for the resultant intensity of two coherent sources of phase difference $\varphi$ gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
I &=2 I_{1}(1+\cos \varphi) \\
&=4 I_{1} \cos ^{2}(\varphi / 2) \\
& \sim 4\left(\frac{\sin \frac{N \delta}{2}}{\sin \frac{\delta}{2}}\right)^{2} \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$

as $\varphi=\frac{2 \pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}$. The maximum intensity is given by $\frac{\delta}{2}=0$, so that $I_{m} \sim$ $4 N^{2}$. Hence

$$
I=\frac{I_{m}}{N^{2}}\left(\frac{\sin \frac{N \delta}{2}}{\sin \frac{\delta}{2}}\right)^{2} \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\pi d \sin \theta}{\lambda}\right) .
$$

(b) For a two-slit system, we take the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$ keeping $N c=a, a$ being the width of each slit:

$$
\begin{aligned}

Figure 2.63 shows a phased array of radar antenna elements spaced at $1 / 4$ wavelength. The transmitting phase is shifted by steps of $\pi / 6$ from element to element, i.e., element " $0^{n}$ has 0 phase, element 1 has $\pi / 6$ phase shift, element 2 has $2 \pi / 6$, element 3 has $3 \pi / 6$, etc.

(a) At what angle $\theta$ is the zero order constructive interference transmission lobe?

(b) Are there any secondary lobes?

Fig. $2.63$

\section{Solution:}

Assuming that the complex amplitude of the transmitting wave from the element " $0^{n}$ is $A$. The complex amplitudes of the successive elements $1,2, \ldots$ are then respectively represented by $A e^{i \delta}, A e^{i 2 \delta}, \ldots$, where

$$
\delta=\frac{2 \pi \lambda}{4 \lambda} \sin \theta+\frac{\pi}{6}=\frac{\pi}{2}\left(\sin \theta+\frac{1}{3}\right) .
$$

The resultant amplitude is given by

$$
A+A e^{i \delta}+A e^{i 2 \delta}+\ldots+A e^{i(N-1) \delta}=\frac{A e^{-\frac{i \psi \delta}{2}} \sin \left(N \frac{\delta}{2}\right)}{e^{-\frac{i \delta}{2}} \sin \frac{\delta}{2}}
$$

and the resultant intensity is $\sim A^{2}[\sin (N \delta / 2) / \sin (\delta / 2)]^{2}$. Constructive interference transmission lobes occur when $\delta / 2=m \pi, m$ being an integer, or $\frac{\pi}{4}\left(\sin \theta+\frac{1}{3}\right)=m \pi$.

(a) When $m=0, \sin \theta=-1 / 3$. Thus the sero order maximum occurs at $\theta=\arcsin (-1 / 3)$.

(b) For the first secondary maximum, $m=\pm 1$ or $\sin \theta=\pm \frac{11}{3}$. Since $|\sin \theta|<1$, no secondary lobe can occur.

\section{1}

Describe the Fabry-Perot interferometer. Derive an equation for the positions of the maxima, and indicate their shape. What is the instrument's resolving power?

(Columbia) 

\section{Solution:}

The instrument makes use of the fringes produced in the transmitted light after multiple reflection in the air film between two plane glass plates thinly silvered on the inner surfaces. A lens behind the plates brings the parallel transmitted rays together for interference. Concentric circular rings are formed with the maxima given by

$$
2 d \cos \theta=m \lambda,
$$

where $d$ is the separation between the silvered surfaces, $\theta$ is the semi-vertex angle subtended by a ring at the center of the lens and $m$ is an integer. For the proof of the above see an optics textbook.

The (chromatic) resolving power of the instrument is the ratio $\frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}$ of two wavelengths $\lambda$ and $\lambda+\Delta \lambda$ such that the intensity maxima of a given order of the two waves cross at $I=\frac{1}{2} I_{\max }$ :

$$
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}=m \frac{\pi r}{1-r^{2}},
$$

where $r^{2}$ is the reflectance of the surfaces.

\section{2}

Find the angular separation in seconds of arc of the closest two stars resolvable by the following reflecting telescope: $8 \mathrm{~cm}$ objective, $1.5$ meter focal length, $80 \mathrm{X}$ eyepiece. Assume a wavelength of $6000 \AA$. $\left(1 \AA=10^{-8}\right.$ cm).

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

The angular resolving power of the telescope is

$$
\Delta \theta_{1}=1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}=1.22 \times \frac{6000 \times 10^{-8}}{8} \approx 2^{\prime \prime} .
$$

The resolving power of the human eye is about 1 minute of arc. Using an eyepiece of magnification $80 \mathrm{X}$, the eye's resolving power is $\Delta \theta_{2}=1^{\prime} / 80<$ $2^{\prime \prime}$. Therefore, the resolvable angular separation of stars using the telescope is $\Delta \theta=\max \left(\Delta \theta_{1}, \Delta \theta_{2}\right)=2^{\prime \prime}$. 

\section{8}

You are taking a picture of the earth at night from a satellite. Can you expect to resolve the two headlights of a car $100 \mathrm{~km}$ away if you are using a camera which has a $50 \mathrm{~mm}$ focal lens with an $f$ number of 2 ?

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

The Rayleigh criterion gives the angular resolving power as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta_{1} &=1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}=1.22 \frac{\lambda}{f^{\prime} / f} \\
& \approx 1.22 \times \frac{0.6 \times 10^{-3}}{50 / 2} \approx 3 \times 10^{-5}(\mathrm{rad}),
\end{aligned}
$$

since

$$
f=\frac{f^{\prime}}{D}
$$

by definition, where $f^{\prime}$ is the focal length of the camera lens and $D$ the diameter of its aperture. Taking the separation between the two headlights of a car to be $1 \mathrm{~m}$, their angular separation at the satellite is

$$
\theta \approx \frac{1}{100 \times 10^{3}} \approx 1 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{rad}<\theta_{1} .
$$

Hence, we cannot resolve the two head lights of a car.

\section{4}

By considering the diffraction of light that passes through a single slit of width $D$, estimate the diameter of the smallest crater on the moon that can be discerned with a telescope if the diameter of the objective lens is $1 / 2$ meter. Assume the wavelength of the light is $5 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~m}$ and the distance from the earth to the moon is $3.8 \times 10^{8}$ meters.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

The angular resolving power of the telescope is

$$
\theta_{1} \approx \lambda / D=10^{-6} \mathrm{rad} .
$$

The smaller resolvable crater diameter is

$$
3.8 \times 10^{8} \times 10^{-6}=380 \mathrm{~m} \text {. }
$$



\section{5}

The headlights of a car are $1.3 \mathrm{~m}$ apart. The pupil of the eye has a diameter of $4 \mathrm{~mm}$. The mean wavelength of light is $\lambda=5,500 \AA$. Estimate the distance at which the headlights can just be resolved.

$(U C$, Berkeley)

\section{Solution:}

The angular resolving power of the eye is $\theta=\frac{122 \lambda}{D}=1.68 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{rad}$. Hence the distance at which the headlights can be resolved is $\frac{1.3}{\theta}=7.75$ $\mathrm{km}$.

\section{6}

The Space Telescope, as currently planned, will have a mirror diameter of $2 \mathrm{~m}$ and will orbit above the earth's atmosphere. Estimate (order of magnitude) the distance between two stars which are $10^{22} \mathrm{~cm}$ from the earth and can just be resolved by this telescope.

(Columbia)

Solution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{D}=\frac{6 \times 10^{-8}}{2 \times 10^{2}}=3 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{rad}, \\
&d \approx 3 \times 10^{-7} \times 10^{22}=3 \times 10^{15} \mathrm{~cm}=3 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~km} .
\end{aligned}
$$

\section{7}

(a) Show that for Fraunhofer diffraction by a slit the direction of the first minimum on either side of the central maximum is given by $\theta=\lambda / w$, where $w$ is the width of the slit and $w>\lambda$.

(b) How wide must a rectangular aperture in front of a telescope be in order to resolve parallel lines one kilometer apart on the surface of the moon? Assume the light has $\dot{\lambda}=500 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}$ and the distance of the moon is 400,000 kilometers.

(Wisconsin) 

\section{Solution:}

(a) The intensity distribution is given by $I \sim\left(\frac{\sin \beta}{\beta}\right)^{2}$, where $\beta=$ $\frac{\pi w \sin \theta}{\lambda}$. For the 1st minimum, $\beta=\pi$ and we have $\sin \theta=\frac{\lambda}{w}$, or $\theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{w}$ as $w \gg \lambda$

(b) $\theta=\frac{1}{4 \times 10^{5}}, w=\frac{5 \times 10^{-7}}{\theta}=0.2 \mathrm{~m}$.

\section{8}

A $35 \mathrm{~mm}$ camera has a lens with a $50 \mathrm{~mm}$ focal length. It is used to photograph an object $175 \mathrm{~cm}$ in height, such that the image is $30 \mathrm{~mm}$ high.

(a) How far from the camera should the person stand?

(b) Estimate the best resolution obtainable on the film using light of $\lambda=5000 \AA$, if the lens aperture is $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ diameter.

(Wisconsin)

Solution:

(a) From

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{5} \\
m=\frac{3}{175}=\frac{v}{u}
\end{array}\right.
$$

we obtain

$$
u=296.7 \mathrm{~cm}, v=50.9 \mathrm{~cm} \text {. }
$$

The person should stand $297 \mathrm{~cm}$ away from the camera.

(b) The angular resolving power of a lens is given by

$$
\Delta \theta=\frac{1.22 \lambda}{D} .
$$

As $\Delta \theta=\frac{\Delta x}{v}$, we have

$$
\Delta x=\Delta \theta \cdot v=1.22 \lambda v / D=1.22 \times 5000 \times 10^{-8} \times 51=3.1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~cm} .
$$

\section{9}

Two stars have an angular separation of $1 \times 10^{-6}$ radian. They both emit light of wavelengths 5770 and $5790 \AA$. (a) How large a diameter of the lens in the telescope is needed to separate the images of the two stars?

(b) How large a diffraction grating is needed to separate the two wavelengths present.

Be explicit and complete in your answers, explaining your reasoning. $(U C$, Berkeley $)$

\section{Solution:}

(a) The angular resolving power of a telescope is given by

$$
\theta=\frac{1.22 \lambda}{D} .
$$

For $\lambda=5790 \AA$ we have

$$
D=\frac{1.22 \times 5790 \times 10^{-8}}{1 \times 10^{-6}}=70.6 \mathrm{~cm} \text {. }
$$

As this is larger than that for $\lambda=5770 \AA$, the diameter needed to separate the two stars should be at least $70.6 \mathrm{~cm}$.

(b) The chromatic resolving power of a grating is given by

$$
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}=m N,
$$

where $N$ is the total number of rulings on the grating, $\lambda$ the mean wavelength, and $m$ the order of diffraction. One usually uses order 1 to 3 for

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-137.jpg?height=62&width=1120&top_left_y=1346&top_left_x=149)
Hence diffraction grating of 289 rulings is needed to separate the wavelengths present.

\section{0}

Two parabolic radio antennae, each of diameter $D$, are separated by a distance $d>D$ and point straight up. Each antenna is driven by a tranomitter of nominal frequency $f$, and wavelength $\lambda(=c / f)<D$. Be sure to properly label all sketches.

(a) What is the approximate shape of the pattern of radiation at large distance away $\left(r>D^{2} / \lambda\right)$ of one antenna if operated alone? (b) What is the approximate shape of the pattern of radiation at large distances $\left(r>d, r>D^{2} / \lambda\right)$ if both antennae are driven in phase by the same transmitter?

(c) Suppose the antennae are driven by separate transmitters, each of nominal frequency $f$. If the pattern of part (b) above is to be maintained essentially stationary for some time $t$, what is the requirement on the frequency stability of the two transmitters?

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) The pattern of radiation at a large distance $r$ for only one antenna is approximately that of Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture:

$$
I=I(0)\left[\frac{2 J_{1}(k R \sin \theta)}{k R \sin \theta}\right]^{2},
$$

where $R=D / 2, k=2 \pi / \lambda, \sin \theta=\rho / r, \rho$ being the radial distance of the point under consideration from the center of the pattern, and $J_{1}$ is Bessel's function of the first kind, order 1.

(b) The waves emitted by the two antennae driven in phase by the same transmitter will interfere with each other and give rise to an intenvity distribution

$$
I=I(0)\left[\frac{2 J_{1}(k R \sin \theta)}{k R \sin \theta}\right]^{2} \cos ^{2} \alpha,
$$

where $\alpha=k d \sin \theta / 2$.

(c) If the pattern of part (b) above is to be maintained essentially stationary for some time $t$, the two transmitters should be partially coherent. The time of coherency $t_{c}$ as determined by

$$
t_{c} \cdot \Delta f \approx 1
$$

should be larger than $t$. Hence we require that

$$
\Delta f \approx \frac{1}{t_{c}}<\frac{1}{t} .
$$

\section{1}

A camera (focal length $50 \mathrm{~cm}$, aperture diameter $D$ ), sensitive to visible light, is sharply focused on the stars; it is then used without refocusing for an object at a distance of 100 meters. Roughly, what aperture $D$ will give the best resolution for this object? Give $D$ in $\mathrm{cm}$.

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $2.64$

\section{Solution:}

Since the camera is sharply focused on stars, the film is located at exactly $50 \mathrm{~cm}$ (focal length) from the lens. For an object $100 \mathrm{~m}$ away, the image, determined by the lens formula

$$
\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}=\frac{1}{f},
$$

lies behind the film. A bright spot of the object at the optical axis will appear on the film as disk of diameter $d$. The best resolution is obtained if $d$ is of the same size as that of the Airy disk of the lens, which is given by

$$
d=\frac{1.22 \lambda f}{D} .
$$

From the geometry shown in Fig. $2.64$ we have

$$
\frac{d}{D}=\frac{v-f}{v} .
$$

Hence we require

$$
d=\frac{(v-f) D}{v}=\frac{f D}{u}=\frac{1.22 \lambda f}{D},
$$

or $D=\sqrt{1.22 \lambda u} \approx 0.82 \mathrm{~cm}$ taking $\lambda=5500 \AA$.

\section{2}

An excellent camera lens of $60 \mathrm{~mm}$ focal length is accurately focussed for objects at $15 \mathrm{~m}$. For what aperture (stop opening) will diftraction blur of visible light be roughly the same as the defocus blur for a star $($ at $\infty)$ ?

(Wisconsin) 

\section{Solution:}

The lens formula

$$
\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f}
$$

gives the image distance as

$$
v=\frac{u f}{u-f} .
$$

The diffraction blur is given by the Rayleigh criterion $\theta=\frac{1.22 \lambda}{D}$. Then the blur diameter is

$$
d=\theta v=\frac{1.22 \lambda v}{D} .
$$

The defocus blur as given by the geometry of Fig. $2.65$ is

$$
d=\frac{(v-f) D}{f} .
$$

If the two are to be equal, we require

$$
D=\sqrt{\frac{1.22 \lambda v f}{(v-f)}}=\sqrt{1.22 \lambda u} .
$$

With $\lambda=5500 \AA$ for visible light, $u=15 \mathrm{~m}$, we have $D=0.32 \mathrm{~cm}$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-140.jpg?height=243&width=416&top_left_y=1212&top_left_x=542)

Fig. $2.65$

\section{8}

A parabolic mirror of small relative aperture $(10 \mathrm{~cm}$ dia, $500 \mathrm{~cm}$ focal length) is used to photograph stars. Discuss the dominant limitations of resolution, first on axis then off axis. Roughly what is the size of the image "blob" for a star on axis for visible light?

(Wisconsin) 

\section{Solution:}

For photographing stars, the dominant limitation of resolution is the Fraunhofer diffraction by the aperture of the telescope. The diameter of the image "blob" (the Airy disk) of a star on axis is

$$
d=\frac{1.22 \lambda f}{D} .
$$

With $D=10 \mathrm{~cm}, f=500 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $\lambda=5000 \AA$ we have

$$
d=0.3 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~cm} .
$$

For a atar off axis, the ray makes an angle $\theta$ with the axis of the telescope. So the effective diameter of the aperture reduces to $D \cos \theta$, and the diameter of the Airy disk becomes

$$
d^{\prime}=\frac{1.22 \lambda f}{D \cos \theta} .
$$

\section{4}

A pinhole camera consists of a box in which an image is formed on the film plane which is a distance $P$ from a pinhole of diameter $d$. The object is at a distance $L$ from the pinhole, and light of wavelength $\lambda$ is used (Fig. 2.66).

(a) Approximately what diameter $d$ of the pinhole will give the best image resolution?

(b) Using the pinhole from part (a), approximately what is the minimum distance $D$ between two points on the object which can be resolved in the image?

(Wisconsin)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-141.jpg?height=225&width=400&top_left_y=1631&top_left_x=509)

Fig. $2.66$ 

\section{Solution:}

(a) By geometrical optics we see that a point on the object would cast a bright disk on the film of diameter $\Delta_{1}$ given by

$$
\frac{\Delta_{1}}{L+P}=\frac{d}{L}
$$

On the other hand, because of diffraction by the pinhole the point would form a bright Airy disk on the film of diameter

$$
\Delta_{2} \approx \frac{\lambda P}{d} .
$$

The resultant diameter of the image of the point is then

$$
\Delta=\Delta_{1}+\Delta_{2}=\frac{(L+P) d}{L}+\frac{\lambda P}{d} .
$$

Minimizing $\Delta$ with respect to $d$ gives

$$
d=\sqrt{\frac{\lambda L P}{L+P}} .
$$

(b) For the images of two close points of separations on the object to be resolved the distance between the two images should not be smaller than $\Delta_{2}$. Geometric optics gives

$$
\frac{D}{L}=\frac{\Delta_{2}}{P} .
$$

Hence $D=\frac{\lambda L}{d}=\sqrt{\frac{\lambda L(L+P)}{P}}$

\section{5}

Estimate the optimum size for the aperture of a pinhole camera. You may assume that intensity is adequate and that the object viewed is at infinity. Take the plane of the flm to be $10 \mathrm{~cm}$ from the pinhole (Fig. 2.67). 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-143.jpg?height=384&width=237&top_left_y=282&top_left_x=591)

Fig. $2.67$

\section{Solution:}

According to the solution of problem 2074, the optimal size of the aperture is

for

$$
d=\sqrt{\frac{\lambda L P}{L+P}} \approx \sqrt{\lambda P}
$$

$$
L>P \text {. }
$$

Hence $d=2.3 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~cm}$ taking $\lambda=5500 \AA$.

\section{6}

Discuss the difference between optics as performed at wavelengths near $100 \AA$ with optics near $5000 \AA$. Specifically, contrast:

(a) Use of lenses.

(b) Use of mirrors.

(c) Chromatic resolving power of gratings of fixed width.

(d) Minimum resolvable angular separation of an image-forming system of fixed diameter.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) Light of wavelenghts near $5000 \AA$ is visible, while that near $100 \AA$, being in the X-ray range, cannot be seen by the eye. As the refractive indices of glass are greater than unity for visible light and less than unity for X-rays, common glass lenses can be used to focus visible light, while X-rays can only be refracted by crystals.

(b) Unlike visible light which can be reflected by common mirrors, $X$ rays can penetrate through most materials and can be reflected only when incident at critical angles.

(c) The chromatic resolving power of a grating is given by $\lambda / \Delta \lambda=m N$, where $\Delta \lambda$ is the least resolvable wavelength difference, $N$ the total number of rulings and $m$ the order of diffraction. For given $m$ and $N$, as $\lambda$ is much smaller for $\mathrm{X}$-rays, $\Delta \lambda$ is also much narrower.

(d) The minimum angle of resolution is given by

$$
\Delta \theta=1.22 \lambda / D,
$$

where $D$ is the diameter of the aperture. As $\Delta \theta \propto \lambda$, the minimum resolvable angular separation should be much smaller for $X$-rays.

\section{7}

Compare the merits of the following three instruments for studying atomic spectra (in the visible range).

(1) Plane diffraction grating.

(2) $60^{\circ}$ glass prism.

(3) Fabry-Perot interferometer.

Consider as quantitatively as possible such features as resolution, dispersion, range, nature of light-8ource, etc. Indicate clearly the important physical and geometrical features in each case. (For the sake of definiteness, you may assume all three instruments to have similar 'apertures'.)

(Wisconsin)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-144.jpg?height=370&width=435&top_left_y=1492&top_left_x=544)

Fig. $2.68$ 

\section{Solution:}

For discriminating wavelengths, the glass prism has the lowest resolving power, while the Fabry-Perot interferometer has the highest and can be used to study the fine structure of spectra. The chromatic resolving power of a spectrometer is defined as $R=\frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}$. For a prism, $R=B\left(\frac{d n}{d \lambda}\right)$, where $B$ is the length of the base and $n$ the refractive index for wavelength i. For a plane grating, $R=m N$, where $m$ is the order of diffraction and $N$ the total number of rulings. For the Fabry-Perot, $R=\frac{m \pi}{1-r} \sqrt{r}$, where $r$ is the reflectance of the mirrors and $m$ the order of interference $\approx \frac{2 s}{\lambda}, s$ being the plate separation. For example for a wavelength of $500 \mathrm{~nm}$, a flint glass prism $\left(n=1.6, \frac{d n}{d \lambda} \approx 8 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\right)$ with $B=10 \mathrm{~cm}$ has $R \sim 10^{4}$, a plane grating of grating space 14000 lines per inch and width 6 inches has $R \sim 10^{8}-10^{6}$, a Fabry-Perto has $R \sim 10^{6}-10^{7}$.

The angular dispersion, defined as $\frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta \lambda}$, is given by $\frac{2 \sin \left(\frac{q}{1}\right)}{\sqrt{1-n^{2} \sin ^{2}\left(\frac{q}{2}\right)}}\left(\frac{d n}{d \lambda}\right)$ for a prism of refracting angle $\alpha$ at minimum deviation, by $\frac{m}{d \cos \theta}$ for a plane grating of grating space $d$, and by $\frac{\cos \theta}{\lambda}$ for the Fabry-Perot interferometer. For the above instruments the angular dispersions are $1.3 \times 10^{3}, 10^{4}$ and $2 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ respectively.

For a prism the range of wavelengths to be studied is limited only by the absorption of the material. For gratings it is limited to avoid overlapping of fringes of different wavelengths. If a range from $\lambda_{1}$ to $\lambda_{2}$ is observed in the $m$-th and $(m+1)$-th orders, there is an overlap if $m \lambda_{2}<(m+1) \lambda_{1}$. Consider the limiting case for a Fabry-Perot where the $(m+1)$-th order of $\lambda$ coincides with the $m$-th order of $\lambda+\Delta \lambda$. The value $\Delta \lambda=\frac{\lambda}{m}=\frac{\lambda^{2}}{2 d \cos \theta} \approx \frac{\lambda^{2}}{2 d}$ for $\theta \approx 0$ is the largest wavelength range with which the instrument should be illuminated to avoid overlapping of the rings of different colors and is known as the free spectral range.

The light-collecting power $L$ of an instrument depends on its total tranomittance $T$, aperture $A$ and the solid angle $\Omega$ subtended by the light gate through $L \approx T A \Omega$. Figure $2.68$ shows the limiting $R$ and $L$ for the three types of instrument. The efficiency of an instrument is often expressed as $E=R L$.

\section{8}

A partially elliptically polarized beam of light, propagating in the $z$ diroction, passes through a perfect linear polarization analyser. When the tranemission axis of the analyzer is along the $x$ direction, the transmitted intensity is maximum and has the value $1.5 I_{0}$. When the transmission axis is along the $y$ direction, the transmitted intensity is minimum and has the value $I_{0}$.

(a) What is the intensity when the transmission axis makes angle $\theta$ with the $x$-axis? Does your answer depend on what fraction of the light is unpolarised?

(b) The original beam is made to pass first through a quarter-wave plate and then through the linear polarization analyzer. The quarter-wave plate has its axes lined up with the $x$ and $y$ ares. It is now found that the maximum intensity is transmitted through the two devices when the analyzer transmission axis makes an angle of $30^{\circ}$ with the $x$-axis.

Determine what this maximum intensity is and determine the fraction of the incident intensity which is unpolarised.

(CUSPEA)

\section{Solution:}

(a) Let the intensity of the unpolarized light after passing through the analyzer be $I_{u}$. This will remain constant whatever angle the transmission axis makes with the $x$-axis. Let the intensities of the $x$ and $y$ components of the elliptically polarized light be $I_{e x}$ and $I_{e y}$ respectively. We have

$$
\begin{aligned}
&I_{x}=1.5 I_{0}=I_{u}+I_{\mathrm{ex}}, \\
&I_{y}=1.0 I_{0}=I_{u}+I_{\mathrm{ey}}
\end{aligned}

An elliptical vibration can be considered as made up of two mutually perpendicular linear ones $90^{\circ}$ out of phase as shown in Fig. 2.69. Its electric field vector can be represented by

$$
\mathbf{E}_{\theta}=\mathbf{E}_{x} \cos \theta+\mathbf{E}_{y} \sin \theta .
$$

The intensity of the polarized component $I_{e}$ is then $I_{e} \sim\left|\mathbb{E}_{0}\right|^{2}$, or

$$
I_{e}=I_{e x} \cos ^{2} \theta+I_{e y} \sin ^{2} \theta .
$$

Hence, writing $I_{u}=I_{u} \cos ^{2} \theta+I_{u} \sin ^{2} \theta$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
I(\theta) &=I_{\mathrm{e}}+I_{\mathrm{u}}=\left(I_{\mathrm{ex}}+I_{\mathrm{u}}\right) \cos ^{2} \theta+\left(I_{\mathrm{ey}}+I_{\mathrm{u}}\right) \sin ^{2} \theta \\
&=1.5 I_{0} \cos ^{2} \theta+I_{0} \sin ^{2} \theta .
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus $I(\theta)$ does not depend on what fraction of the light is unpolarised.

(b) A $\frac{\lambda}{4}$ plate introduces a $90^{\circ}$ phase change between the two mutually perpendicular components and makes the elliptically polarised light linear polarised. As

we have

$$
\frac{\sqrt{I_{e y}}}{\sqrt{I_{e x}}}=\tan 30^{\circ}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

$$
I_{e y}=\frac{I_{e x}}{3} .
$$

\section{Combining it with the two original equations yields}

$$
\begin{aligned}
&I_{\mathrm{ex}}=0.75 I_{0}, I_{\mathrm{ey}}=0.25 I_{0}, \\
&I_{\mathrm{u}}=0.75 I_{0} .
\end{aligned}
$$

\section{Hence the maximum intensity is}

$$
I_{e x}+I_{e y}+I_{u}=1.75 I_{0}
$$

when $\theta=30^{\circ}$. The unpolarized fraction of the incident intensity is

$$
\frac{2 I_{u}}{1.5 I_{0}+I_{0}}=0.60 \text {. }
$$

\section{9}

Four perfect polariving plates are stacked so that the axis of each is turned $30^{\circ}$ clockwise with respect to the preceding plate. How much of the intensity of an incident unpolarised beam of light is transmitted by the stack?

(Wisconsin) 

\section{Solution:}

An unpolarized light can be regarded as the resultant of two noncoherent linearly polarized components with mutually perpendicular plenes of polarisation. Then if the intensity of the incident light is $I_{0}$, the intensity of the light emerging from the first polarizing plate is $I_{0} / 2$. According to Malus' law, the intensity of light emerging from a polarizing plate reduces to $\cos ^{2} \theta$ of that of the incident linearly polarized light, where $\theta$ is the angle between the transmission axis of the plate and the plane of polarisation of the incident light. So the intensity of the light emerging from the fourth plate is

$$
I_{4}=I_{3} \cos ^{2} \theta=I_{2} \cos ^{4} \theta=I_{1} \cos ^{6} \theta=\frac{I_{0} \cos ^{6} \theta}{2}=\frac{27 I_{0}}{128} .
$$

A thin, quartz crystal of thickness $t$ has been cut so that the optic axis (o.a.) is parallel to the surface of the crystal (Fig. 2.70). For sodium light $(\lambda=589 \mathrm{~nm})$, the index of refraction of the crystal is $1.55$ for light polarized parallel to the optic axis and $1.54$ for light polarized perpendicular to the optic axis.

(a) If two beams of light, polarized parallel and perpendicular to the optic axis respectively, start through the crystal in phase, how thick must the crystal be in order that the beams emerge $90^{\circ}$ out of phase?

(b) Let a beam of unpolarised light pass through a polarizing plate to become plane polarised. The polarized light is allowed to fall normally on the above crystal. If the transmission axis of the polarizing plate makes an angle of $45^{\circ}$ with the optic axis of the crystal, the emerging light will be circularly polarised.

\section{1}

Suppose you have been supplied with a number of sheets of two types of optically active material. Sheets of type $P$ are perfect polarisers: they transmit (normally incident) light polarised parallel to some axis $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ and absorb light polarised perpendicular to $\hat{n}$. Sheets of type $Q$ are quarterwave plates: they advance the phase of (normally incident) light polarized parallel to some axis $\hat{\mathrm{m}}$ by $\pi / 2$ relative to light polarized perpendicular to $\hat{\mathbf{m}}$.

(a) Describe how to combine these materials to produce a device which converts incident light polarised parallel to some axis $*$ to outgoing light polarised perpendicular to $\star$ (see Fig. 2.71). What is the loss in intensity in the device you have constructed?

Fig. $2.71$

(b) Describe how to combine these materials to produce a "circular polariser $"$ - a device which converts unpolarised light entering side $A$ into circularly polarised light leaving side $B$ (see Fig. 2.72). What is the minimum possible loss in intensity in this process? 

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-150.jpg?height=337&width=439&top_left_y=243&top_left_x=242)

(c) If the power entering side $\mathbf{A}$ is $I_{0}$ with wavelength $\lambda$, what is the magnitude of the torque on the circular polariser in part (b)?

(d) If the light emerging from the circular polariser is normally incident on a mirror, what is the loss of intensity of the light in passing through the polarizer a second time? (See Fig. 2.73)

(e) Take two sheets of the circular polariser you constructed in part (b). Flip one over and put them together as shown in Fig. 2.74. Suppose unpolarised light is incident normally on this system. What is the intensity of transmitted light as a function of $\theta$ ?

Fig. $2.75$

\section{Solution:}

(a) Place two P-type sheets together such that the first sheet has its $\hat{n}$ axis at $45^{\circ}$ to the $\hat{x}$ axis and the second has its $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ axis at $90^{\circ}$ to the $\hat{x}$ axis. The combined sheet will convert an incident light polarized parallel to $\hat{*}$ into an outgoing light polarized perpendicular to $\hat{x}$. The outgoing intensity is reduced to $I_{0} \cos ^{4} 45^{\circ}=I_{0} / 4$, where $I_{0}$ is the incident intensity, according to the law of Malus.

(b) Combine a polariser (A side) and a $\frac{\lambda}{4}$ wave plate (B side) so that the axe $\mathrm{h}$ and $\mathbf{m}$ are orientated at $45^{\circ}$ to each other. The combined sheet will convert unpolarised light into circularly polarised light. The outgoing intensity is reduced to $I_{0} / 2$ if absorption by the $\frac{\lambda}{4}$ wave plate is negligible.

(c) The angular momentum $J$ and energy $W$ of a circularly polarised light are related by $J=W \omega^{-1}$, where $\omega=2 \pi \nu, \nu$ being the frequency of the light. The torque on the circular polarizer is

$$
\tau=\frac{d J}{d t}=\omega^{-1} \frac{d W}{d t}=\frac{1}{2} I_{0} \omega^{-1}=\frac{I_{0} \lambda}{4 \pi c},
$$

since only $I_{0} / 2$ goes into the circularly polarised light.

(d) The circularly polarised light is reflected back through the $\frac{\lambda}{4}$ wave plate; the result is a plane polarised light, polarised at right angle to the transmission axis of the polarizer (A side). Therefore, no light is transmitted backwards through the combination.

(e) The intensity of the transmitted light is

$$
I=\frac{1}{2} I_{0} \cos ^{2} \theta .
$$

(f) The intensity of the transmitted light is

$$
I=\frac{1}{2} I_{0} \sin ^{2} \theta .
$$

\section{2}

Consider the Babinet Compensator shown in the figure (Fig. 2.76). The device is constructed from two pieces of uniaxial optical material with indices $n_{e}$ and $n_{0}$ for light polarised perpendicular and parallel to the optic axis, respectively. A narrow beam of light of vacuum wavelength $\lambda$ is linearly polarized in the $\mathrm{XZ}$ plane at $45^{\circ}$ to $\mathrm{X}$ and $\mathrm{Z}$ and propagates through the compensator from left to right along the $+Y$ axis as shown (Fig. 2.77).

(a) For $d \ll L$, calculate the relative phase shift of the $\mathrm{X}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ polarised components of the exit beam. Express your answer in terms of $n_{0}, n_{e}, \lambda, L, d, x$ (b) For what values of $x$ will the emerging light be

(1) linearly polarized?

(2) circularly polarized?

Fig. $2.77$

\section{Solution:}

(a) As the incident light is polarized at $45^{\circ}$ to $\mathrm{X}$ - and $\mathrm{Z}$-axes, it is equivalent to two components, polarized in $X$ and $\mathrm{Z}$ directions, of amplitudes

$$
E_{\mathrm{x}}=E_{\mathrm{z}}=E / \sqrt{2} \text {. }
$$

The relative phase shifts of the two components of the beam resulting from traveraing the left prism and the right prism are respectively given by

$$
\Delta \varphi_{1}=2 \pi d_{1}\left(n_{0}-n_{e}\right) / \lambda
$$

and

$$
\Delta \varphi_{2}=2 \pi d_{2}\left(n_{\mathrm{e}}-n_{0}\right) / \lambda,
$$

where $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ are the distances traveled inside the left prism and the right priom respectively, since the first prism has refractive indices $n_{0}$ and $n_{e}$ for the $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathrm{Z}$ polarised components respectively and the reverse is true for the second prism.

The relative phase shift of the $X$ and $Z$ polarised components of the exit beam is then

$$
\Delta \varphi=\Delta \varphi_{1}+\Delta \varphi_{2}=2 \pi\left(n_{0}-n_{\mathrm{e}}\right)\left(d_{1}-d_{2}\right) / \lambda .
$$

By similar triangles we have

$$
\frac{d_{1}}{d}=\frac{\frac{L}{2}+x}{L} .
$$

Therefore, as $d=d_{1}+d_{2}$,

$$
\Delta \varphi=\frac{4 \pi}{\lambda}\left(n_{0}-n_{e}\right) \frac{x d}{L} .
$$

(b) The emerging light would be

(i) linearly polarised if

$$
\Delta \varphi=N \pi \text {, i.e., } x=\frac{N \lambda L}{4\left(n_{0}-n_{e}\right) d},
$$

(ii) circularly polarized if

$$
\Delta \varphi=\frac{(2 N+1) \pi}{2} \text {, i.e., } x=\frac{(2 N+1)}{8} \frac{\lambda L}{\left(n_{0}-n_{e}\right) d} \text {, }
$$

where $N=0$ or integer.

\section{8}

Consider the modified Young's double-slit arrangement (Fig. 2.78): $Q$ is a monochromatic point source of light with wavelength $\lambda$. $S_{1}$ is a screen having a long narrow slit and $S_{2}$ has two slits of width a separated by a distance $d \gg a, \mathrm{P}_{1}, \mathrm{P}_{2}, \mathrm{P}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{4}$ are polarizing filters. For each of the following arrangments, describe and briefly explain the intensity pattern on the screen $S_{3}$.

(a) All polarizers removed. (Here derive a formula for the intensity pattern on $\mathrm{S}_{3}$.)

(b) $P_{1}$ removed, $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ have mutually perpendicular pass axes while the axis of $P_{4}$ is at $45^{\circ}$ to that of $P_{2}$.

(c) As in (b) but with $P_{4}$ removed.

(d) $P_{1}$ in place and at $45^{\circ}$ to $P_{2}, P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ still crossed, $P_{4}$ perpendicular to $P_{1}$.

(CUSPEA)

Fig. $2.78$

\section{Solution:}

(a) The intensity distribution on $S_{3}$ is that of the interference fringes produced by a double-slit modulated by the single-slit diffraction factor and is given by

$$
I(\theta) \propto \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{1}{2} k d \sin \theta\right) \frac{\sin ^{2}\left(\frac{1}{2} k a \sin \theta\right)}{\sin ^{2} \theta},
$$

where $k=2 \pi / \lambda$ and $\theta$ is the angle between the diffracted direction and the axis.

(b) As the incoming light on $S_{2}$ is unpolarized, the beams leaving $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}\left(P_{2}, P_{3}\right.$ crossed $)$ are incoherent and will not interfere whether passing through $\mathrm{P}_{4}$ or not. We conclude that no interference pattern occurs for (b) and (c). Only the single-slit diffraction images of the slits are seen.

(d) As the incoming light in $S_{4}$ is linearly polarized, the beams emerging from $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ are coherent and their components along the axis of $P_{4}$ will interfere though the relative phase shift between the two components is $\pi$. We get the interference pattern again but the contrast is reversed as compared with that for (a).

\section{4}

A source of circularly polarised light illuminates a screen with two equidistant narrow slits separated by a distance $L$ (see Fig. 2.79). A thin birefringent slab of thickness $d$ is placed over one of the slits. Its index of refraction is $n_{0}$ parallel to the slit and $n_{e}$ perpendicular to the slit. A second screen, parallel to the first, is placed at a distance $D>L$ behind the first screen. If one of the slits is covered, the total intensity on the second screen is $I_{0}$ (neglect diffraction effects). With both slits open, what is the interference pattern that would be observed by someone who measures the total intensity, summed over polarisations?

(UC, Berkeley)

\section{Solution:}

Pacsing through the birefringent slab behind $S_{1}$ causes a relative phase shift between the two orthogonal components ( $O$ and $E$ beams) of

$$
\delta=2 \pi d\left(n_{0}-n_{e}\right) / \lambda_{3}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-155.jpg?height=434&width=755&top_left_y=1267&top_left_x=309)

Fig. $2.79$

while the phases of the two orthogonal components of light emerging from $S_{2}$ remain unchanged. Consider the $O$ and $E$ components arriving at the second screen after leaving $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$. The optical path difference between the beams leaving $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ for the two components are

$$
\Delta_{0}=\left(n_{0}-1\right) d
$$

and

$$
\Delta_{e}=\left(n_{e}-1\right) d
$$

respectively.

It is obvious that only when $\left(n_{0}-n_{\mathrm{e}}\right) d=m \lambda$ ( $m$ being an integer) can the $O$ and $E$ beams be perfectly coherent at the same time. The contrast of the fringes will then be unity. Otherwise, the contrast is lese than unity, especially when $\left(n_{0}-n_{\mathrm{e}}\right) d=(m+1 / 2) \lambda$, for which interference fringes disappear.

\section{5}

A beam of light, with $\lambda=5000 \AA$, traveling in the $z$-direction is polarised at $45^{\circ}$ to the $x$-direction. It passes through a Kerr cell, i.e., a substance such that $n_{x}-n_{y}=K E^{2}$, where $n_{x}$ and $n_{y}$ are the refractive indices for light polarised in the $x$ and $y$ directions. $E$ is the strength of an externally applied electric field in the $x$-direction. The cell has length $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $K=2.5 \times 10^{-6}$ (meter) $^{2} /(\text { volts })^{2}$.

(a) If the light, after passing through the Kerr cell, passes through a polarization analyzer whose plane of polarisation is perpendicular to that of the original beam, calculate the smallest value of $E$ which gives maximum transmission. Assume the effect of the electric field on reflection at the Kerr cell is negligible.

(b) What is the state of polarization of the light emerging from the Kerr cell if the value of $E^{2}$ is half that calculated in (a)?

(c) Consider the following arrangement (Fig. 2.80).

Fig. $2.80$ The electric field is applied to the upper half of the Kerr cell only, and, after passing through the Kerr cell, the light passes through two slits as shown. There is no polarization analyzer after the slits. Assuming that the electric field affects $n_{x}$ but not $n_{y}$, discuss the interference pattern, at a large distance beyond the slits, for various values of $E^{2}$.

(UC, Berkeley)

\section{Solution:}

(a) The Kerr cell induces birefringence. As the direction of the electric field is $45^{\circ}$ to the direction of polarisation of the light, the amplitudes of the components polarised parallel to the $x$ and $y$ directions are the same. When the phase difference $\delta$ between the components is

$$
\delta=\frac{2 \pi l\left(n_{x}-n_{y}\right)}{\lambda}=\frac{2 \pi l K E^{2}}{\lambda}=(2 j+1) \pi, j=0 \text { or integer, }
$$

the Kerr cell acts as a half-wave plate and rotates the plane of polarization by $90^{\circ} s 0$ that it coincides with the transmission axis of the analyzer and gives maximum transmission. Putting $j=0$ yields the smallest $E, E_{\min }$, which is given by

$$
E_{\min }^{2}=\frac{\lambda}{2 K l}=10 \quad \mathrm{~V}^{2} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \text { for } l=1 \mathrm{~cm} .
$$
polarised.

(b) If $E^{2}=\frac{1}{2} E_{\min }^{2}=\frac{\lambda}{4 K 1}, \delta=\frac{\pi}{2}$ and the emergent light is circularly

(c) The interference pattern on the far screen is the same as that for a double-slit system, but the contrast is dependent on the polarization states of the light beams emerging from the upper and lower slits. The polarisation state of light emerging from the lower slit remains unchanged, while that emerging from the upper slit depends on the strength of the applied electric field. When $\delta=2 j \pi$, where $j$ is an integer, or

$$
E^{2}=\frac{j \lambda}{K l},
$$

the polarization states of the light beams emerging from the two slits become identical. This gives rise to a perfect interference pattern with the contrast being unity. When

$$
\delta=(2 j+1) \pi, \text { or } E^{2}=\frac{(2 j+1) \lambda}{2 K l},
$$

the polarization plane of the light emerging from the upper slit is perpendicular to that from the lower slit. There will now be no interference between the beams. In the intermediate cases, the contrast is between unity and sero.

\section{6}

The plane of polarisation of plane polarised light transmitted along the optic axis of certain crystals (e.g., quarts or sugar crystals) is rotated by an amount which depends on the thickness of the material. The indices of refraction $n_{R}$ and $n_{\zeta}$ for right- and left-circularly polarised light are slightly different in these crystals.

(a) What is this phenomenon called? Describe briefly how the rotation is explained.

(b) Derive an expression for the angle $\phi$ by which the plane of polarisation of light of frequency $\omega$ is rotated in passing through a thickness $d$ of the material.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) This phenomenon is called optical activity. An optically active material possesses two indices of refraction, one, $n_{R}$, for right-handed rotation and the other, $n_{L}$, for left-handed rotation. Since the incident linearly polarized wave can be represented as a superposition of $R$ - and L-circularly polarized waves, in traversing an optically active specimen, the relative phase between the two components will change and the resultant linearly polarised light will appear to have rotated in its plane of polarisation.

(b) If $n_{R} \neq n_{L}$, the angle of rotation of the L-component after passing through a thickness $d$ of the material is

$$
\phi_{\mathrm{L}}=\frac{\omega d}{c} n_{\mathrm{L}},
$$

and the angle of rotation of the R-component is $\phi_{R}=\frac{\omega d}{c} n_{R}$, since the speeds of propagation are $c / n_{\mathrm{L}}$ and $c / n_{R}$ respectively. The angle $\phi$ by which the plane of polarization of the resultant light is rotated is then (see Fig. 2.81)

$$
\phi=\frac{\phi_{\mathrm{R}}-\phi_{\mathrm{L}}}{2}=\frac{\omega d}{2 c}\left(n_{\mathrm{R}}-n_{\mathrm{L}}\right) .
$$

Explain semiquantitatively how one could produce circularly polarised light from an unpolarised source, using a linear polariser and a slab of fused 

\section{(i.e., isotropic) quarts and a compressor clamp.}

\section{Solution:}

(a) When Bragg's law

$$
2 d \sin \theta=m \lambda \quad(m=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

is satisfied, we get intense spots on the film. The wavelength $\lambda$ is given by

$$
\lambda=\sqrt{150 / V} \AA
$$

The smallest $\theta$ for film recording is given by $m=1$, for which

$$
\theta_{\min }=\arcsin \left(\frac{\lambda}{2 d}\right)=\arcsin \left(\frac{1}{2 d} \sqrt{\frac{150}{V}}\right)
$$

(b) Some stress-sensitive optical materials, such as glass, plastic and melted-quarts, can be made optically anisotropic by the application of mechanical stress. This is known as photoelasticity. The effective optic axis is in the direction of the stress and the induced birefringence $\left(n_{e}-n_{0}\right) l$, where $l$ is the thickness along the direction of stress, is proportional to the stress. A beam of unpolarized light passing through a polarizer becomes linearly polarized. It falls normally on a slab of melted quarts being compressed along a direction perpendicular to the beam and at $45^{\circ}$ to the axis of the polarizer (Fig. 2.83). If the stress applied is such that $\left(n_{\mathrm{o}}-n_{\mathrm{e}}\right) l=\lambda / 4$, the slab acts as a quarter-wave plate and makes the linearly polarized light circularly polarized.

\section{8}

Suppose right-handed circularly polarised light (defined to be clockwise as the observer looks toward the oncoming wave) is incident on an absorbing slab. The slab is suspended by a vertical thread. The light is directed upwards and hits the underside of the slab.

(a) If the circularly polarised light is 1 watt of wavelength $6200 \AA$, and if all of this light is absorbed by the slab, what is the torque, $\tau_{0}$, exerted on the slab in dyne-cm?

(b) Suppose that instead of an absorbing slab you use an ordinary silvered mirror surface, so that the light is reflected back at $180^{\circ}$ to its original direction. What is the torque now in units of $\tau_{0}$ ?

(c) Suppose that the slab is a transparent half-wave plate. The light goes through the plate and does not hit anything else. What is the torque in units of $\tau_{0}$ ?

(d) If the slab is a transparent half-wave plate with the top surface silvered, what is the torque in units of $\tau_{0}$ ?

(Chicago)

\section{Solution:}

(a) If a beam of circularly polarized light is completely absorbed by an object on which it falls, an angular momentum

$$
\tau_{0}=W / \omega
$$

is transferred to the object so that a torque is exerted on the object, where $W$ is the amount of energy absorbed per second and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the light. Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{0} &=W / \omega=\frac{W \lambda}{2 \pi c}=\frac{1 \times 0.62 \times 10^{-6}}{2 \pi \times 3 \times 10^{8}}=3.3 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{~N} . \mathrm{m} \\

(b) The light is reflected back totally such that the direction of rotation of the plane of polarisation in space remains unchanged, so that the torque is sero.

(c) After passing through a half-wave plate, the right-handed circularly polarised light becomes left-handed polarised. The torque exerted is equal to the change in angular momentum, which is $2 \tau_{0}$.

(d) The light passes through the half-wave plate twice and remains in the same state as it re-emerges. Hence no torque is exerted on the slab.

A special light source directs 1 watt of light into a flat black $(100 \% \mathrm{ab}-$ sorbing) disc, which is mounted on an axle parallel to the beam (Fig. 2.84). The target starts to spin as it absorbs light.

(a) What can you say about the light?

(b) The target is changed from the black surface to a mirror surface. What happens to the torque? Why?

(c) Can you modify the target so as to increase the torque above the values you calculated for cases (a) and (b)? For simplicity keep the target at normal incidence. (d) Assume visible light $(5000 \AA)$ and estimate the torque for the ab-
sorbing case (a). $(U C$, Berkeley)

\section{Solution:}

(a) From the fact that the disc absorbs the light totally and starts to spin, we conclude that the light is circularly polarised. A torque

$$
\tau_{0}=W / \omega
$$

is exerted on the disc, where $W$ is the power and $\omega$ the angular frequency of the light.

(b) The light is now reflected totally such that the direction of rotation of the plane of polarization of the light in space remains unchanged. No torque is exerted on the target, which remains stationary.

(c) Place a quarter-wave plate before the surface of the mirror in case (b). Passing through the $\lambda / 4$ plate twice, the oncoming $L$ (or $R$ )-handed circularly polarised light will be reflected back $R$ (or L)-handed. This will increase the torque to $2 \tau_{0}$. No such enhancement is possible for case (a).

(d) The torque for the absorbing case (a) is

$$
\tau=\frac{W}{\omega}=\frac{W \lambda}{2 \pi c}=\frac{1 \times 0.5 \times 10^{-6}}{2 \pi \times 3 \times 10^{8}}=2.65 \times 10^{-16} \text { N.m. }

(Columbia)

Fic. $3.1$

Solution:

(a) The ruby laser is an optically pumped, three-level system. A simplified energy-level diagram is shown in Fig. 3.1. As the ruby is irradiated with a high-intensity flash lamp, the atoms in the ground state $E_{1}$ are excited into level $E_{3}$, then rapidly relax into the metastable state $E_{2}$ by a non-radiative transition because the lifetime at $E_{3}$ is very short (about $10^{-9}$ second). As decay from $E_{2}$ is relatively slow, if the energy of the Aash lamp is sufficiently intense and optical pumping is applied, a population inversion between $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ occurs. When this condition attains, amplification occurs at the wavelength corresponding to $E_{2}-E_{1}$. Then as the atoms drop down from the level $E_{2}$ to the ground level $E_{1}$, the characteristic red fluorescent radiation of ruby at this wavelength is emitted as an intense pulse. The optical pumping is accomplished by using two flat mirror placed at the two ends of the ruby to form a resonant cavity, which reflects to and fro, and amplifies continuously, those spectral modes which propagate along the axis and oscillate with the resonant frequencies of the cavity. These should fall within the frequency bandwidth of the spectral gain of the ruby.

(b) The wavelength in water is

$$
\lambda_{\text {water }}=\frac{\lambda_{\text {air }}}{n}=\frac{6943}{\frac{4}{3}} \approx 5207 \AA .
$$

(c) The angle of refraction is given by Snell's law to be

$$
\theta_{2}=\sin ^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4} \sin 45^{\circ}\right) \approx 32^{\circ} \text {. }
$$

The reflectance of the component polarised perpendicular to the plane of incidence is

$$
R_{\perp}=\left[\frac{\sin \left(\theta_{1}-\theta_{2}\right)}{\sin \left(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}\right)}\right]^{2} \approx 0.05
$$

that of the component polarized parallel to the plane of incidence is

$$
R_{\|}=\left[\frac{\tan \left(\theta_{1}-\theta_{2}\right)}{\tan \left(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}\right)}\right]^{2} \approx 0.0028 .
$$

(d) For a plane electromagnetic wave, $\sqrt{\epsilon} E=\sqrt{\mu} H$. The time-averaged power of the beam per unit cross-sectional area is its intensity

$$
I=\langle E H\rangle=\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mu}}\left\langle E^{2}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mu}} E_{0}^{2}=\frac{n}{2 c \mu} E_{0}^{2},
$$

where $E_{0}$ is the amplitude of the electric field, $c$ the velocity of light in free space and $n$ the refractive index of water. The permeability of water is

$$
\mu \approx \mu_{0}=4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{H} / \mathrm{m} .
$$

Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
E_{0} &=\sqrt{\frac{2 I c \mu}{n}}=7.5 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{m}, \\
B_{0} &=\frac{E_{0}}{v}=\frac{E_{0} n}{c}=3.3 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~T},
\end{aligned}
$$

$B_{0}$ being the amplitude of the magnetic induction. (e) The uncertainty principle states that

$$
\Delta t \cdot \Delta \nu \sim 1,
$$

where $\Delta \nu$ is the width of the spectrum line of the laser light, $\Delta t$ is the time of coherence. Thus the length of coherence is

$$
\Delta l=\frac{c}{\Delta \nu}=\frac{3 \times 10^{8}}{30 \times 10^{6}}=10 \mathrm{~m} .
$$

\section{2}

A dye laser (Fig. 3.2) consists of two nearly perfectly reflecting mirrorg, $M$, and a gain medium, $G$, of bandwidth $\Delta f$ centered at $f_{0}$.

(a) What are the allowed frequencies for laser operation in this optical cavity? Express your answer in terms of the time, $\tau$, it takes light to make one round trip in the cavity.

(b) Assume that the laser operates on all possible cavity modes within the gain bandwidth. Also, assume that these modes are all stable in phase, i.e., there are no fluctuations in phase. Also, assume that the phases are adjusted so that all modes are instantaneously in phase at $t=0$. How will the laser output vary in time?

(c) If it is desired to produce a pulse of one picosecond $\left(10^{-12} \mathrm{sec}\right)$ duration at a wavelength of $6000 \AA$, what bandwidth $\Delta f$ is required? How many laser modes would this involve? (Let $l=1.5 \mathrm{~m}$ )

(CUSPEA)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-167.jpg?height=285&width=595&top_left_y=1341&top_left_x=395)

Fig. $3.2$

\section{Solution:}

(a) The only modes allowed in the cavity are standing waves for which the wavelengths $\lambda$ and frequencies $f$ are given by

$$
n \lambda=2 l, \quad f=\frac{c}{\lambda}=\frac{c n}{2 l}=\frac{n}{r},
$$

where $n$ is an integer.

(b) Suppose there are $N$ modes within the gain bandwidth. The laser output, under the conditions given, can be expressed as

$$
E(t)=\sum_{n}^{N}\left(A_{n} \cos \frac{2 \pi n t}{\tau}+B_{n} \sin \frac{2 \pi n t}{\tau}\right) .
$$

(c) The last equation shows that the output is a periodic function of time of period $\tau$ (see Fig. 3.3). When the phase difference between the highest mode and the lowest mode is $2 \pi$, the output ceases. The pulse duration, $\Delta t$, is therefore given by

$$
\frac{2 \pi(N-1) \Delta t}{\tau}=2 \pi \text {, i.e., } \Delta t \approx \frac{\tau}{N} \text {. }
$$

The uncertainty principle $\Delta t \cdot \Delta f \sim 1$ gives

$$
\Delta f \sim \frac{1}{\Delta t}=10^{12} \mathrm{~Hz} .
$$

As $\lambda f=c$ or $d \lambda=-\frac{\lambda^{2}}{c} d f$, the corresponding band of wavelengths is

$$
\Delta \lambda=\Delta f \frac{\lambda^{2}}{c} \approx 12 \AA \text {. }
$$

By definition,

$$
\tau=\frac{2 l}{c}=10^{-8} \mathrm{~s},
$$

giving

$$
N \approx \frac{\tau}{\Delta t}=\frac{10^{-8}}{10^{-12}}=10^{4} .
$$

A He-Ne laser operating at $6328 \AA$ has a resonant cavity with plane end mirror spaced $0.5 \mathrm{~m}$ apart. Calculate the frequency separation between the axial modes of this laser. Estimate whether this laser would operate at one or at several axial frequencies given that the linewidth of the $\mathrm{Ne} 6328 \AA$ line observed in spontaneous emission is typically $0.016 \AA$ wide.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

The axial frequencies of the laser are given by

$$
\frac{\lambda n}{2}=l \text { or } f=\frac{n c}{2 l},

\section{$l$ being the length of the cavity. The frequency separation between succes- sive modes is then

$$
\Delta f=\frac{c}{2 l} .

The frequency bandwidth of the $\operatorname{Ne} 6328 \AA$ line is given by

$$
\Delta f^{\prime}=c \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda^{2}},

$$
\frac{\Delta f^{\prime}}{\Delta f}=\frac{2 l \Delta \lambda}{\lambda^{2}}=3.996,

the laser will operate at 4 (at least 3) axial frequencies.

(Wisconsin) 

\section{Solution:}

\section{(a) The acronym laser stands for "Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation."}

(b) The output of a laser is a highly coherent, both in space and time, and highly directional beam.

(c) As shown in Fig. 3.4, a beam of high energy electrons passes through a transverse, undulating magnetic field; the electrons suffer transverse acceleration and deceleration and electromagnetic radiation is produced by Bremsstrahlung. The initial electromagnetic waves may also be provided by a laser. If a synchronism condition exists between the electron velocity and the phase velocity of the waves, energy may be transferred from the electrons to the waves. The waves are built up in the cavity between two mirrors and finally a laser output is produced.

(d) The advantages of FEL's are the following.

(i) FEL is tunable. Varying the energy of the incident electrons allows coherent radiation to be produced at any wavelength from microwaves to visible light, and beyond.

(ii) It can provide high peak-power, broadband and coherent radiation.

An undulator consists of a linear periodic array of magnets of alternating polarity. Each repeat unit in the array of magnets has length $d$ and there are $N$ such units. An electron of speed $v(v \sim c)$, passing through this undulator, travels a path with only small deflections, as shown in Fig. 3.5. The motion of the electron along this path produces radiation which is most intense at a certain fundamental frequency corresponding to a wavelength $\lambda$.

\section{Solutlon:}

(a) As shown in Fig. 3.6, electromagnetic radiation in the forward direction will be generated at points where the tangent to the path is parallel to the axis.

Fig. $3.6$ (b) The condition required is

i.e.,

$$
k r-\omega t=k(r+d)-\omega\left(t+\frac{d}{v}\right)+2 \pi

Putting $\frac{v}{c}=\beta$, we have

$$
\frac{c}{\lambda} \frac{d}{v}=\frac{d}{\lambda}+1 .

$$
\lambda=d\left(\frac{1}{\beta}-1\right) .

(c) $\Delta \lambda / \lambda=1 / N$.

(d) $I \approx N^{2}$.

\section{6}

A new and important experimental technique being used in several sub-fields of physics is the use of ultra-short light pulses for studying fast phenomena. The ultra-short pulses are produced by mode-locking a laser - a method to be studied in this problem. The model laser consists of an optical cavity of length $L$ with transverse dimensions $d$ formed by two flat mirrors as shown in Fig. 3.7.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-172.jpg?height=209&width=843&top_left_y=1478&top_left_x=345)

Fig. 3.7

The amplifying medium (it may be solid, liquid, or gas) can be characterized by a certain gain spectrum (Fig. 3.8); only light within this band of frequencies will be amplified. To simplify calculation, assume the gain spectrum is rectangular as shown in Fig. 3.9.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-173.jpg?height=292&width=383&top_left_y=330&top_left_x=309)

Fig. $3.8$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-173.jpg?height=288&width=383&top_left_y=334&top_left_x=773)

Fig. $3.9$

To be specific, consider the amplifying medium Nd glass, which has $\omega_{0}=1.8 \times 10^{15} \mathrm{sec}^{-1}, \Delta \omega=6 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{sec}^{-1}$, and take the length of the laser to be $L=150 \mathrm{~cm}$.

(a) Find the separation $\delta \omega_{L}$ between adjacent longitudinal modes of the cavity. Neglect the modulator for this part of the problem, neglect dispersion, and, for simplicity, take the refractive index of the amplifying medium to be one.

(b) The rectangular gain spectrum will result in each mode within the gain band having equal amplitude. If the intensity of an individual mode is $I_{0}$, what is the total intensity when the relative phases $\phi_{n}$ of the different modes are randomly distributed?

(c) By inserting a modulated absorber into the cavity, one can lock the phases of all the modes to the same value, so that traveling waves interfere constructively, producing light pulses. Find the intensity as a function of time in this phase-locked or mode-locked case. What is the pulse duration, pulse separation, and peak intensity (in terms of $I_{0}$ )? Consider only one polarisation.

(It is irrelevant for this problem, but for your information, a modulated absorber has an effective absorption that is a function of time - e.g., $\alpha=\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2} \cos (\omega t)$. Any cavity mode with the wrong phase relative to this modulation experiences excess attenuation, so only phase-locked modes are amplified.)

(Princeton)

\section{Solution:}

(a) The longitudinal modes that can exist in a cavity of length $L$ are those for which

$$
L=n \frac{\lambda}{2}, \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots),
$$

i.e.,

$$
\omega_{L}=\frac{2 \pi c}{\lambda}=\frac{\pi n c}{L} .
$$

Hence the separation between adjacent modes is

$$
\delta \omega_{L}=\frac{\pi c}{L}=6.3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} .
$$

(b) If the relative phases $\phi_{n}$ of the different modes are randomly distributed, the modes are incoherent with one another, and the total intensity is the sum of the intensities of the individual modes; that is

$$
I=\text { integer }\left(\frac{\Delta \omega}{\delta \omega_{L}}\right) \cdot I_{0}=9549 I_{0} .
$$

(c) With mode-locking, the intensity must now be found by first adding up the electric fields, rather than the intensities directly,

where

$$
I(t)=I_{0}\left|e^{-i \omega_{1} t}+\ldots+e^{-i \omega_{n} t}\right|^{2}=I_{0}\left[\frac{\sin \frac{n \delta \omega_{L} t}{2}}{\sin \frac{\delta \omega_{L} t}{2}}\right]^{2}
$$

The pulse duration is

$$
\omega_{n}=n \delta \omega_{L}, n=\text { integer }\left(\frac{\Delta \omega}{\delta \omega_{L}}\right)=9549 .
$$

$$
\Delta t=\frac{2 \pi}{n \delta \omega_{L}}=\frac{2 L}{n c}=1.05 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~s} .
$$

The pulse separation is the interval between two maxima:

$$
\Delta_{t}=\frac{2 \pi}{\delta \omega_{L}}=10^{-8} \mathrm{~s} .
$$

The peak intensity occurs at $t=0$ :

$$
I(0)=I_{0} \cdot n^{2}=9.12 \times 10^{7} I_{0} .
$$

A projective photon, with frequency $f$ in the rest frame of a target electron, is seen to scatter at $-90^{\circ}$ with frequency $f^{\prime}$, while the target scatters at $\theta^{\circ}$.

(c) If the photon energy loss would be $0.2$ of the rest energy of the electron, what would be the speed of the scattered electron?

(d) An observer $O$ moves in a direction parallel to the incident photon's direction at a speed $u$ when the electron-photon collision occurs. What expresion would 0 use for his measure of the electron's energy in its scattered state (in terms of $m, v, u$ and $c$ )?

(SUNY, Buffalo)

Solution:

(a) Referring to Figs. $3.10$ and $3.11$, we have

where

$$
p_{e} \sin \theta=p_{f^{\prime}}, p_{e} \cos \theta=p_{f},
$$

$$
p_{e}=m v, p_{f}=\frac{h f}{c}, p_{f^{\prime}}=\frac{h f^{\prime}}{c} .
$$

Hence $\tan \theta=f^{\prime} / f$

Fig. $3.11$

(b) The total energy of the electron is

$$
E=\left[m^{2} c^{4}+p_{s}^{2} c^{2}\right]^{1 / 2}=\left[m^{2} c^{4}+\left(f^{2}+f^{\prime 2}\right) h^{2}\right]^{1 / 2} .
$$

(c) The rest mass of electron is $m c^{2}$ and the photon energy loss is $0.2 m c^{2}$. According to the energy conservation law, we have

$$
m c^{2}+h f=\gamma m c^{2}+h f^{\prime}
$$

where

$$
\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{y^{2}}{c^{2}}}}

$$
h f-h f^{\prime}=(\gamma-1) m c^{2}=0.2 m c^{2},

we get

$$
\text { (d) } E^{\prime \prime}=\frac{E-p_{0} \cdot u}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}=\frac{E-p_{0} u \cos \theta}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}} \text {, }
$$

$$
\gamma=1.2 \text { or } v=0.53 c .

(a) Calculate the charge needed.
(b) Calculate the energy of the action potential.

(b) $E=\frac{Q V}{2}=\frac{1}{2} \times 7 \times 10^{-11} \times 0.07=2.5 \times 10^{-12}$ joule.

\section{9}

A point source, $Q$, emits coherent light isotropically at two frequencies, $\omega$ and $\omega+\Delta \omega$, with equal power, $I$ joules/sec, at each frequency. Two detectors, $A$ and $B$, each with a (small) sensitive area $S$ capable of responding to individual photons, are located at distances $l_{A}$ and $l_{B}$ from $Q$ as shown in Fig. 3.12. In the following, take $\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega} \ll 1$ and assume the experiment is carried out in vacuum.

(a) Calculate the individual photon counting rates (potons/sec) at A and at $B$ as functions of time. Consider time scales $>1 / \omega$.

(b) If now the output pulses from $A$ to $B$ are put into a coincidence circuit of resolving time $\tau$, what is the time-averaged coincidence counting rate? Assume that $r \ll 1 / \Delta \omega$ and recall that a coincidence circuit will produce an output pulse if the two input pulses arrive within a time $\tau$ of one another.

Fig. 3.12

\section{Solution:}

(a) The waves of angular frequencies $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ arriving at $A$ can be represented by

$$
\begin{aligned}
E_{1} &=\frac{E_{0}}{l_{A}} e^{i\left(\omega_{1} t-k_{2} l_{A}\right)} \\
E_{2} &=\frac{E_{0}}{l_{A}} e^{i\left(\omega_{2} t-k_{2} l_{A}\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$

respectively, where $\omega_{1}=\omega, \omega_{2}=\omega+\Delta \omega$. The resultant wave at $A$ is then

$$
E_{\mathrm{A}}=E_{1}+E_{2}=\left(E_{0} / l_{\mathrm{A}}\right)\left[e^{i\left(\omega_{1} t-k_{1} l_{\mathrm{A}}\right)}+e^{i\left(\omega_{2} t-k_{2} l_{A}\right)}\right]
$$

and the intensity at $A$, time-averaged, is

$$
I_{\mathrm{A}} \sim \frac{1}{2} E_{\mathrm{A}} E_{\mathrm{A}}^{*}=\left(\frac{E_{0}}{l_{\mathrm{A}}}\right)^{2}\left\{1+\cos \left[\left(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1}\right) t-\left(k_{2}-k_{1}\right) l_{\mathrm{A}}\right]\right\} .
$$

The constant phase difference $\left(k_{2}-k_{1}\right) l_{A}$ can be taken as zero by choosing a suitable time origin. The intensity of the $\omega_{1}$ wave at $A$ is

As the source has power $I$ and is isotropic,

$$
I_{1} \sim \frac{1}{2} E_{1} E_{1}^{*}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{E_{0}}{l_{\mathrm{A}}}\right)^{2} .
$$

giving

$$
I_{1}=\frac{I}{4 \pi l_{A}^{2}},
$$

Hence

$$
\left(\frac{E_{0}}{l_{A}}\right)^{2} \sim \frac{I}{2 \pi l_{A}^{2}} .
$$

The photon counting rate at $A$ is

$$
I_{A}=\frac{I}{2 \pi l_{A}^{2}}[1+\cos (\Delta \omega t)] .
$$

Similarly, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_{\mathrm{A}}(t) &=\frac{I_{\mathrm{A}}(t) S}{\hbar \omega} . \\
&=\frac{I S}{2 \pi \hbar \omega l_{\mathrm{A}}^{2}}[1+\cos (\Delta \omega t)] .
\end{aligned}
$$

As

$$
I_{\mathrm{B}}(t)=\frac{I}{2 \pi l_{\mathrm{B}}^{2}}\left\{1+\cos \left[\Delta \omega t+\left(l_{\mathrm{B}}-l_{\mathrm{A}}\right)\left(k_{1}-k_{2}\right) \mid\right\} .\right.
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
&k_{1}=\frac{\omega_{1}}{c}=\frac{\omega}{c}, \\
&k_{2}=\frac{\omega_{2}}{c}=\frac{\omega+\Delta \omega}{c}, \\
&k_{1}-k_{2}=-\frac{\Delta \omega}{c},
\end{aligned}
$$

we have

$$
I_{B}(t)=\frac{I}{2 \pi l_{B}^{2}}\left\{1+\cos \left[\Delta \omega t+\frac{\left(l_{A}-l_{B}\right)}{c} \Delta \omega\right]\right\},
$$

giving

$$
R_{\mathrm{B}}(t)=\frac{I S}{2 \pi \hbar \omega l_{\mathrm{A}}^{2}}\left\{1+\cos \left[\Delta \omega t+\frac{\left(l_{\mathrm{A}}-l_{\mathrm{B}}\right) \Delta \omega}{c}\right]\right\} .
$$

(b) The probability that a signal from $A$ at time $t$ be accompanied by one from $B$ within a time $\pm \tau$ is $2 \tau R_{\mathrm{B}}(t)$. Hence the coincidence counting rate is

$$
\begin{aligned}
R_{\mathrm{AB}}(t) &=R_{\mathrm{A}}(t) R_{\mathrm{B}}(t)(2 \tau) \\
&=\frac{I^{2} S^{2} \tau}{2 \pi^{2} \hbar^{2} \omega^{2} l_{\mathrm{A}}^{2} l_{\mathrm{B}}^{2}}[1+\cos (\Delta \omega t)]\left\{1+\cos \left[\Delta \omega\left(t+\frac{l_{\mathrm{A}}-l_{\mathrm{B}}}{c}\right)\right]\right\} .

Fig. $3.13$

\section{Solution:}

A photomultiplier tube is a device which multiplies a single photoelectron by five or six orders of magnitude. In addition to a photo-emission cathode, it has several dynodes which are maintained at successively higher potentials (see Fig. 3.13). Generally the potential is increased by 100 -volt steps from one dynode to the next. The potential difference accelerates the electrons so that when they strike the surface of a dynode, each causes three or four secondary electrons to be ejected. These secondary electrons are then accelerated towards the next dynode and the process is repeated. In this manner, a single electron at the cathode can be multiplied to one million electrons at the anode after ten stages.

The resultant anode current $I$, which is proportional to the mean number $\bar{N}$ of the electrons collected, is on average proportional to the energy $E$ of the incoming photon. The number $N$ of the electrons collected satisfies the Poisson distribution

$$
\mathrm{P}(N)=\bar{N}^{N} e^{-N} / N !
$$

For large $\bar{N}$, the Poisson distribution approximates the Gaussian distribution:

$$
\mathrm{P}(N) \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp \left[-\frac{(N-\bar{N})^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}\right], \sigma=\sqrt{\bar{N}} .
$$

The half-width of the distribution, $\Delta N$, (see Fig. 3.14) is given by

i.e.,

$$
\mathrm{P}\left(\bar{N}+\frac{\Delta N}{2}\right) / \mathrm{P}(\bar{N})=\frac{1}{2}=\exp \left[-\frac{(\Delta N / 2)^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}\right]
$$

$$
\Delta N=2 \sqrt{2 \ln 2 \cdot \sigma^{2}}=2 \sqrt{2 \bar{N} \ln 2} .
$$

For a tube with 10 dynodes, each of secondary-emission rate $5, \bar{N} \simeq$ $5^{10}$. From Fig. 3.15, we see that to distinguish two photons of energies $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ differing by $50 \%$ we require

$$
\frac{\Delta N}{\bar{N}} \approx 2 \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln 2}{5^{10}}} \leq 50 \% .
$$

As this is satisfied, we conclude that such a tube can distinguish between the two photons.

\section{1}

(a) What is meant by

(i) the Doppler line width, and

(ii) the natural line width of a spectral line?

(b) Describe an experiment for making "Doppler free" measurements of spectral lines. (You need not be quantitative, but your answer should make clear that you understand the basic physics involved.)

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) (i) The Doppler broadening of spectral lines is caused by the random thermal motion of the radiating atoms and is proportional to $T^{1 / 2}$, where $T$ is the absolute temperature of the source.

(ii) According to Heisenberg's uncertainty principal, $\Delta t \cdot \Delta E \sim h$, an excited state of lifetime $\Delta t$ of an atom has an uncertainty in energy of $\Delta E$. The corresponding spectral line $\nu=\frac{E}{h}$ therefore has a natural width $\Delta \nu=\frac{\Delta E}{h} \sim \frac{1}{\Delta t}$. (b) The method of double-photon absorption can be employed to make "Doppler free" measurements of spectral lines. A molecule, having absorbed two photons $\hbar \omega_{1}\left(k_{1}\right)$ and $\hbar \omega_{2}\left(\mathbf{k}_{2}\right)$, would be exited from state $i$ to state $f$. If the molecule is motionless,

$$
E_{\mathrm{f}}-E_{\mathrm{i}}=\hbar\left(\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}\right),
$$

and no Doppler shift occurs. If the molecule moves with velocity $\mathbf{v}$,

$$
E_{\mathrm{f}}-E_{\mathrm{i}}=\hbar\left[\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}-\mathrm{v} \cdot\left(\mathrm{k}_{1}+\mathbf{k}_{2}\right)\right],
$$

and a Doppler shift $\mathbf{v} \cdot\left(\mathbf{k}_{1}+\mathbf{k}_{2}\right)$ occurs. The Doppler shift is sero if $\mathbf{k}_{1}=-\mathbf{k}_{2}$.

Two beams of laser light of the same frequency $\omega$ are incident in op posite directions on a gas sample as shown in Fig. 3.16. Double-photon absorption that takes place can be detected by the $f \rightarrow m$ (an intermediate state) fluorescent transition.

\section{2}

(a) Consider the emission or absorption of visible light by the molecules of a hot gas. Derive an expression for the frequency distribution $f(\nu)$ expected for a spectral line, central frequency $\nu_{0}$, due to the Doppler broadening. Assume an ideal gas at temperature $T$ with molecular weight $M$.

Consider a vessel filled with argon gas at a pressure of 10 Torr(1 Torr $=$ $1 \mathrm{~mm}$ of mercury) and a temperature of $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Inside the vessel is a small piece of sodium which is heated so that the vessel will contain some sodium vapor. We observe the sodium absorption line at $5896 \AA \AA$ in the light from a tungsten filament passing through the vessel. Estimate: 
(b) The magnitude of the Doppler broadening of the line.
(c) The magnitude of the collision broadening of the line.

Assume here that the number of sodium atoms is very small compared to the number of argon atoms. Make reasonable estimates of quantities that you may need which are not given and express your answers for the broadening in Angstroms.

\section{Atomic weight of sodium $=23$.}

(CUSPEA)

\section{Solution:} by

(a) The Doppler frequency shift, viewed along the $z$ direction, is given

i.e.,

$$
\nu=\nu_{0}\left(1+\frac{v_{s}}{c}\right)
$$

$$
v_{s}=c\left(\frac{\nu-\nu_{0}}{\nu_{0}}\right) \text {. }
$$

The velocities of the molecules follow the Maxwell-Boltsmann distribution

$$
d P=\left(\frac{M}{2 \pi R T}\right)^{3 / 2} e^{-\frac{M v^{2}}{2 \pi T}} d v_{x} d v_{y} d v_{x},
$$

where $M$ is the molecular weight of the gas and $R$ is the gas constant. Integrating over $v_{x}$ and $v_{y}$ from sero to infinity yields the distribution for $v_{x}$ :

$$
d P=\left(\frac{M}{2 \pi R T}\right)^{1 / 2} e^{-\frac{M v^{2}}{2 R 2}} d v_{x}
$$

giving the frequency distribution

$$
d P=\frac{1}{\nu_{0}}\left(\frac{M c^{2}}{2 \pi R T}\right)^{1 / 2} e^{-M c^{2}\left(\nu-\nu_{0}\right)^{2} / 2 R T \nu_{0}^{2}} d \nu .
$$

(b) The frequency distribution has the form of a Gaussian distribution with the standard deviation $\sigma$ give by

Hence

$$
\sigma^{2}=\frac{R T \nu_{0}^{2}}{M c^{2}} .
$$

$$
\Delta \nu \approx \sqrt{\frac{R T}{M c^{2}}} \nu_{0},
$$

or

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \lambda & \approx \sqrt{\frac{R T}{M c^{2}}} \lambda_{0}=\sqrt{\frac{(8.3)(473)}{\left(40 \times 10^{-3}\right)}} \frac{\lambda_{0}}{\left(3 \times 10^{8}\right)} \\
&=1.04 \times 10^{-6} \lambda_{0}=1.04 \times 10^{-6} \times 5896 \AA=6.13 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~A} .
\end{aligned}
$$

(c) The mean free path $\Lambda$ is given by

$$
\Lambda=\frac{1}{n \sigma},
$$

where $\sigma=\pi r^{2} \approx 3 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, taking $r \approx 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}$. The number of molecules per unit volume is

$$
n=\frac{A}{V}=\frac{p A}{R T},
$$

where $A$ is Avogadro's number. Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
n &=\frac{\left(1.01 \times 10^{5} \times 10 / 760\right)}{(8.3)(473)} \times 6.02 \times 10^{23} \\
&=2.04 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting gives $\Lambda=1.7 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}$. The average time interval between two collisions is $\tau=\Lambda / v$, where the $v$ is the mean speed of a sodium atom,

Thus

$$
v \approx \sqrt{\frac{R T}{M}}=\sqrt{\frac{(8.3)(473)}{23 \times 10^{-3}}} \approx 413 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \text {. }
$$

$$
\tau=\frac{1.7 \times 10^{-4}}{413}=4 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~s}
$$

The broadening due to collision is given by the collision frequency $\Delta \nu=$ 1/T. In terms of wavelength, the broadening is

$$
\Delta \lambda=\frac{c}{\nu^{2}} \Delta \nu=\frac{\lambda^{2}}{c \tau}=3 \times 10^{-5} \stackrel{\circ}{\mathrm{A}}
$$



\section{8}

Consider a gas of atoms $A$ at $T=300 \mathrm{~K}, p=100$ Torr. The mass of each atom is $4.2 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg}$ and Boltzmann's constant is $1.4 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{K}$. Some of the atoms are in excited states $A^{*}$ and emit radiation of frequency $\nu$.

(a) Estimate the Doppler width $\Delta \nu_{\mathrm{D}} / \nu$.

(b) Assume a reasonable cross-section for $A^{*}$-A collision and estimate the pressure-broadened width of the line $\Delta \nu_{p} / \nu$.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a)

$$
\frac{\Delta \nu_{\mathrm{D}}}{\nu}=\frac{1}{c} \sqrt{\frac{k T}{m}}=\frac{1}{3 \times 10^{8}} \sqrt{\frac{1.4 \times 10^{-23} \times 300}{4.2 \times 10^{-27}}}=3 \times 10^{-6} .
$$

(b) The pressure-broadened width $\Delta \nu_{p}$ is the collision frequency of a molecule of the gas

$$
\Delta \nu_{p}=v / \Lambda,
$$

where $v$ is its mean speed, given by $\sqrt{k T / m}$, and $\Lambda$ is the mean free path of a molecule, given by

$$
\frac{1}{\pi r^{2} n}=\frac{1}{\pi r^{2}} \sqrt{\frac{k T}{p}} \text {, }
$$

$r$ being the radius of a molecule $\approx 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}, n$ the number of molecules per unit volume. Thus

$$
\Delta \nu_{p}=\pi r^{2} n \sqrt{\frac{k T}{m}}=\frac{\pi p r^{2}}{\sqrt{k m T}}=7.2 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~Hz} .
$$

For visible light, $\lambda \approx 5000 \AA$ or $\nu=6 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}$,

$$
\Delta \nu_{p} / \nu=1.2 \times 10^{-7} \text {. }
$$

\section{4}

An electronic transition in ions of ${ }^{12} \mathrm{C}$ leads to photon emission near $\lambda=500 \mathrm{~nm}(h \nu=2.5 \mathrm{eV})$. The ions are in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $k T=20 \mathrm{eV}$, a density $n=10^{24} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$, and a non-uniform magnetic field which ranges up to $B=1$ Tesla. (a) Briefly discuss broadening mechanisms which might cause the transition to have an observed width $\Delta \lambda$ greater than that obtained for very small values of $T, n$ and $B$.

(b) For one of these mechanisms calculate the broadened width $\Delta \lambda$ using order of magnitude estimates of the needed parameters.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

(a) Thermal motion of ions broadens spectral lines because of the Doppler effect. The broadening is proportional to $\sqrt{T}$, where $T$ is the absolute temperature.

Collisions between ions also cause a broadening, the collision or preasure broadening, which is proportional to $\sqrt{T}$ and to $n$, the number density of ions, or $p$, the pressure of the gas.

When a source is placed in a magnetic field, a spectral line may break up with the energy shifts proportional to $B$, the strength of the magnetic field. This spliting is known as the Zeeman effect. If the magnetic field is non-uniform, the spectral shifts would range from zero to a maximum value dependent on $B$, i.e., the spectral lines are broadened with the width proportional to $B$.

(b) The Doppler broadening is given by

Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} &=\frac{1}{c} \sqrt{\frac{k T}{m}}=\frac{1}{3 \times 10^{8}}\left(\frac{20 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}}{12 \times 1.67 \times 10^{-27}}\right)^{1 / 2} \\
&=\frac{1.3 \times 10^{4}}{3 \times 10^{8}} \approx 4 \times 10^{-5} .
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\Delta \lambda=5000 \times 4 \times 10^{-5}=0.2 \AA \text {. }
$$

The collision broadening is given by

or

$$
\Delta \nu \approx r^{2} n \sqrt{\frac{k T}{m}}=10^{-20} \times 10^{24} \times 1.3 \times 10^{4}=1.3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~s}^{-1},
$$

$$
\Delta \lambda=\lambda^{2} \Delta \nu / c \approx 0.1 \AA \text {. }
$$

The energy shift of a spectral line caused by the Zeeman effect is given by

$$
\Delta E=\mu_{\mathrm{B}} B \Delta(M g),
$$

where $M$ is the magnetic quantum number, $g$ the Land√© factor, $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ the Bohr magneton

$$
\mu_{\mathrm{B}}=\frac{c h}{4 \pi m c}=0.93 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~A} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{-2} \text {. }
$$

Taking $\Delta(M g) \sim 1$, we have, with $B=1$ Tesla,

$$
\Delta E \approx 10^{-23} \mathrm{~J} \text {. }
$$

\section{Hence}

$$
\Delta \lambda=\frac{\lambda^{2} \Delta \nu}{c}=\frac{\lambda^{2} \Delta E}{h c} \approx\left(\frac{5000^{2} \times 10^{-23}}{6 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^{18}}\right)=0.1 \AA .
$$

\section{5}

During the days when there are no clouds and the atmosphere is relatively dust (smog) free and has low humidity, the sky, away from the sun, has a very deep blue color. This is due to molecular scattering.

(a) If the molecular electric polarizability due to the photon $\mathbf{E}$ field is frequency independent, show how this leads to a wavelength dependence of the scattering of sunlight similar to that observed. Discuss the angular dependence of the scattering.

(b) If in each air volume element $\Delta V$ of sides small compared with $\lambda$, the mean number of molecules is $N_{0} \Delta V \gg 1$, and if there is no fluctuation about this mean number, show that no net scattering results.

(c) If the root-mean-square fluctuation of the number of molecules equals the square root of the mean number, show that the net scattering intensity is as if each molecule scattered independently with no interference between molecules.

(d) When the relative humidity is near $100 \%$ there is observed to be enhanced scattering (relative to (c)) for water molecules. Explain.

(Columbia)

\section{Solution:}

(a) The electric field $\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}_{0} \cos (\omega t)$ of the incident light polarizes the air molecules into oscillating dipoles, each of moment $\mathbf{p}_{0} \cos (\omega t)$, where

$$
\mathbf{p}_{0}=\frac{e^{2}}{m} \frac{\mathbf{E}_{0}}{\left(\omega_{0}^{2}-\omega^{2}\right)},
$$

$e$ and $m$ being the charge and mass of an electron, $\omega_{0}$ its characteristic frequency. For optical frequencies, $\omega \ll \omega_{0}$, so that the polarizability $e^{2} / m \omega_{0}^{2}$ is independent of frequency.

The field of the radiation scattered by such an induced dipole has an amplitude at a large distance $r$ from the dipole of

$$
E=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^{2} \frac{\sin \theta}{r} p_{0},
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{r}$ and the orientation of the dipole. The corresponding scattered intensity is

$$
\begin{aligned}
I &=\frac{1}{2} E H=\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{0}}{\mu_{0}}} E^{2}=\frac{\omega^{4}}{32 \pi^{2} \epsilon_{0} c^{3}}\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{r}\right)^{2} p_{0}^{2} \\
&=\left(\frac{e^{2}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} m c^{2}}\right)^{2} \frac{\epsilon_{0} c E_{0}^{2}}{2}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)^{4}\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{r}\right)^{2} \\
&=a^{2} I_{0}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)^{4}\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{r}\right)^{2},
\end{aligned}
$$

where $a$ is the classical radius of an electron and $I_{0}$ the intensity of the incident light. Thus $I \propto \omega^{4} \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^{4}}$. Hence, of the visible light the blue color is preferentially scattered. This accounts for the blueness of the sky if we are not watching along the line of sight of the sun.

The scattered intensity has an angular distribution $\sim \sin ^{2} \theta$. For an unpolarised incident light, let its direction be along the $z$-axis and consider light scattered into a direction in the $x z$ plane making angle $\psi$ with the $z$-axis as shown in Fig. 3.17(a). At some instant, the electric field of the incident light at the dipole, $\mathbf{E}_{0}$, (and hence the induced dipole) makes angle $\phi$ with the $x$-axis. Geometry gives

$$
\cos \theta=\cos \phi \sin \psi .
$$

As $\phi$ is random, we ahave to average $\sin ^{2} \theta$ over $\phi:$

$$
\left\langle\sin ^{2} \theta\right\rangle=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi}\left(1-\cos ^{2} \phi \sin ^{2} \psi\right) d \phi=\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\cos ^{2} \psi\right) .
$$

Hence the scattered intensity for an unpolarised incident light has an angular distribution $\sim\left(1+\cos ^{2} \psi\right)$. The scattered intensity is maximum in the forward and backward directions, and is minimum in a transverse direction. (b) Consider a small volume element $\Delta V \& \lambda^{3} \ll r^{3}$. Imagine it as being made up of $q$ equal layers, each of thickness $<\lambda, \sqrt{2} \lambda / q$ apart and making an angle $\frac{\pi}{4}$ with the incident light as shown in Fig. 3.17(b). The phase difference between any two adjacent layers is

$$
\Delta \delta=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \frac{\sqrt{2} \lambda}{q} \sin \frac{\pi}{4}=\frac{2 \pi}{q} .
$$

(a)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-188.jpg?height=526&width=589&top_left_y=468&top_left_x=742)

(b)

Fig. 3.17

Let the field of the light scattered in the direction $\psi$ by the $k$-th layer be $E_{k} \cos \left(\omega t-\delta_{k}\right)$. The resultant field in that direction is then

$$
E=\sum_{k=1}^{q} E_{k} \cos \left(\omega t-\delta_{k}\right)
$$

with

$$
\delta_{k}-\delta_{k-1}=\frac{2 \pi}{q} \text {. }
$$

If the molecules are uniformly distributed in the volume element with no fuctuation, then $E_{1}=E_{2}=\ldots=E_{q}$. Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
E &=E_{1} \sum_{k=0}^{q-1} \cos \left(\omega t-\delta_{1}+\frac{2 k \pi}{q}\right) \\
&=E_{1} \operatorname{Re}\left\{e^{i\left(\omega t-\delta_{1}\right)} \sum_{k=0}^{q-1} e^{i \frac{2 k \pi}{q}}\right\} \\
&=E_{1} \operatorname{Re}\left\{e^{i\left(\omega t-\delta_{1}\right)}\left(\frac{1-e^{i 2 \pi}}{1-e^{i \frac{2 \pi}{q}}}\right)\right\}=0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, no net scattering results.

(c) If the number $N$ of molecules in each layer fluctuates about a mean $\bar{N}$, the $E_{k}$ 's also fluctuate about a mean $\bar{E}$ :

$$
E_{k}=\bar{E}+\Delta_{k} .
$$

Then

so that

$$
\begin{aligned}
E &=\sum_{k=1}^{q}\left(\bar{E}+\Delta_{k}\right) \cos \left(\omega t-\delta_{k}\right) \\
&=\sum_{k=1}^{q} \Delta_{k} \cos \left(\omega t-\delta_{k}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
E^{2}=& \sum_{k=1}^{q} \Delta_{k}^{2} \cos ^{2}\left(\omega t-\delta_{k}\right) \\
&+\sum_{k=1}^{q} \sum_{l \neq k} \Delta_{k} \Delta_{l} \cos \left(\omega t-\delta_{k}\right) \cos \left(\omega t-\delta_{l}\right) \\
\approx & \sum_{k=1}^{q} \Delta_{k}^{2} \cos \left(\omega t-\delta_{k}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

since the $\Delta_{k}$ 's are independent of one another and are as likely positive as negative.

We can write

$$
E^{2} \approx q\left\langle\Delta_{k}^{2}\right) \cos ^{2}(\omega t-\delta) .
$$

From Eq. (1) we see that

Then

$$
\Delta_{k}^{2}=\left(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^{4}\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{r}\right)^{2}\left(N_{k}-\bar{N}\right)^{2} p_{0}^{2} .
$$

$$
\left\langle\Delta_{k}^{2}\right\rangle=\left(\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^{4}\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{r}\right)^{2} \bar{N} p_{0}^{2}
$$

as it is given that $\left\langle\left(N_{k}-\bar{N}\right)^{2}\right\rangle=\bar{N}$.

Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
I &=\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{0}}{\mu_{0}}} q\left\langle\Delta_{k}^{2}\right\rangle \\
&=\frac{\omega^{4}}{32 \pi^{2} \epsilon_{0} c^{3}}\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{r}\right)^{2} q \bar{N} p_{0}^{2} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Now $q \bar{N}$ is the total number of molecules in $\Delta V$. A comparison of the above with Eq. (2) shows that the net scattered intensity is the same as if each of the molecules scattered independently with no interference between them.

For a dilute gas of volume $V$ and $N_{0}$ moleclules per unit volume, we then have from Eq. (2)

$$
I=\left(\frac{e^{2}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} m c^{2}}\right) I_{0}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)^{4}\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{r}\right)^{2} N_{0} V .
$$

If its refractive index is $n$, the Clausius-Mossotti relation

$$
n^{2}-1=\frac{N_{0} e^{2}}{\epsilon_{0} m \omega_{0}^{2}}
$$

gives

$$
I=\pi^{2} I_{0} \frac{\left(n^{2}-1\right)^{2}}{\lambda^{4}} \frac{V}{N}\left(\frac{\sin \theta}{r}\right)^{2},
$$

which is known as Rayleigh's formula.

(d) When the relative humidity is near $100 \%$, water molecules condense to form droplets. These fine particles scatter the blue color when a beam of white light passes through them. This is known as Tyndall scattering and is much stronger than Rayleigh scattering.

\section{6}

On a clear day the sky appears blue because of:
(a) reflection from the sea,
(b) density fluctuations of the atmosphere which cause scattering,
(c) cobalt vapors in the atmosphere.

$(C O T)$

Solution:

The answer is (b).

A typical molecular gas shows absorption bands over the entire electromagnetic spectrum from $\mathrm{X}$-rays to radio waves. In terms of atomic and molecular structure state the absorption process responsible for absorption bands in the following regions of the spectrum:
(a) X-ray,
(b) ultraviolet and visible,
(c) near infra-red,
(d) far infra-red and radio.

(Wisconsin)

\section{Solution:}

When electromagnetic waves pass through a gas into a spectroscope, those wavelengths which the medium would emit if its temperature were raised high enough will be absorbed, so that the spectrum will contain dark lines on regions corresponding to upward transitions between the energy levels of the atoms or molecules of the gas.

(a) X-ray: Removal of an electron from the inner shell of an atom to an outer shell or out of the atom.

(b) Ultraviolet and visible: Transition between the energy states of an orbiting atomic electron.

Consider the earth's atmosphere (consisting of $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{~N}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ $\mathrm{O}_{3}$ etc.). Discuss whether the atmosphere is reasonably transparent or strongly absorbing for each of the following frequency regions. If absorbing, say what are the most important mechanisms.
(a) $10^{8}-10^{\circ} \mathrm{Hs}$.

(Columbia)

\section{Solution:}

(a) Microwaves of frequencies $10^{8}-10^{9} \mathrm{Hs}$ are strongly absorbed by $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

(b) Far infra-red light is strongly absorbed by $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

\section{9}

Explain the physical principles involved in the following phenomena:
(a) the blue sky
(b) the red sun at sunset
(c) the rainbow
(e) the twinkling of stars.

(Columbia)

\section{Solution:}

(a) The intensity of the radiation scattered by air molecules is, according to Rayleigh's scattering formula, inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. Hence, the shorter wavelength (blue color) component of the visible sun light is more strongly scattered and the sky appears blue when the observation is not along the line of illumination (see Fig. 3.18(a)).

(b) At sunset or sunrise, the sun light passes through a thicker layer of the atmosphere than at noon and its blue components are scattered out. Consequently the sun looks reddish (see Fig. 3.18(b)).

Sunlight travels to earth in approximately:
(a) $1 \mathrm{hr}$
(b) $8 \mathrm{~min}$
(c) $8 \sec$

\section{Solution:}

The answer is (b).

\section{1}

Sunlight is normally incident on the surface of water with index of refraction $n=1.33$.

(a) Derive the energy reflection and transmission coefficients, $R$ and $T \cdot(R+T=1)$

(b) If the incident fux is $1 \mathrm{~kW} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, what is the pressure that sunlight exerts on the surface of the water?

Be careful: part (b) may not follow from part (a) as directly as you think! 

\section{Solution:}

(a) Fresnel's formulae give for normally incidence

$$
\begin{aligned}
&R=\left(\frac{n_{2}-n_{1}}{n_{2}+n_{1}}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{n-1}{n+1}\right)^{2}=0.02 \\
&T=\frac{4 n_{1} n_{2}}{\left(n_{2}+n_{1}\right)^{2}}=\frac{4 n}{(n+1)^{2}}=0.98 \\
&R+T=1
\end{aligned}
$$

(b) From the point of view of the photon theory, light pressure is the result of a transfer of the momentum of the incoming light to the target. If $W$ is the incident flux density and $R$ the reflection coefficient, the change of momentum per unit area is

$$
\frac{W R}{c}-\left(-\frac{W}{c}\right)=\frac{(1+R) W}{c} .
$$

\section{By definition this is the light pressure $p$}

$$
p=\frac{(1+0.02) \times 1000}{3 \times 10^{8}}=3.34 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2} .
$$

\section{2}

An electromagnetic wave $\left(\mathbf{E}_{0}, \mathbf{H}_{0}\right)$ traveling in a medium with index of refraction $n_{1}$ strikes a planar interface with a medium with $n_{2}$. The angle the wave makes with the normal to the interface is $\theta_{1}$. Derive the general Fresnel equations for the reflected and refracted waves. Obtain Brewster's law as a special case of these equations.

(Columbia)

\section{Solution:}

If the incident electromagnetic wave is unpolarized, it can be considered as consisting of two components, one plane polarized with the electric field in the plane of incidence, and the other plane polarized with the electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence. Consider the first component and let the electric and magnetic vectors of the incident, reflected and refracted waves be represented by $E_{p_{1}}, E_{p_{1}}^{\prime}, E_{p_{2}}$ and $H_{s_{1}}, H_{s_{1}}^{\prime}, H_{s_{2}}$, respectively (See Fig. 3.20). The boundary conditions on the field vectors give

$$
\begin{aligned}
&E_{p_{1}} \cos \theta_{1}+E_{p_{1}}^{\prime} \cos \theta_{1}=E_{p_{2}} \cos \theta_{2}, \\
&H_{p_{1}}-H_{\theta_{1}}^{\prime}=H_{s_{2}} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Fig. 2.20

\section{For a plane electromagnetic wave,}

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{\epsilon_{1}} E_{p_{1}} &=\sqrt{\mu_{1}} H_{s_{1}}, \\
\sqrt{\epsilon_{1}} E_{p_{1}}^{\prime} &=\sqrt{\mu_{1}} H_{s_{1}}^{\prime}, \\
\sqrt{\epsilon_{2}} E_{p_{2}} &=\sqrt{\mu_{2}} H_{s_{2}} .
\end{aligned}
$$

\section{Assuming the media to be non-ferromagnetic, we have}

$$
\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=\mu_{0},
$$

and so

$$
n_{1}=\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{1}}{\epsilon_{0}}}, n_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{2}}{\epsilon_{0}}} .
$$

\section{Equation (2) can then be written as}

$$
n_{1} E_{p_{1}}-n_{1} E_{p_{1}}^{\prime}=n_{2} E_{p_{2}} .
$$

Snell's law gives $n_{1} \sin \theta_{1}=n_{2} \sin \theta_{2}$. Combining this with Eqs. (1) and (2) yields

$$
r_{p} \equiv \frac{E_{p_{1}}^{\prime}}{E_{p_{1}}^{\prime}}=\frac{\tan \left(\theta_{2}-\theta_{1}\right)}{\tan \left(\theta_{2}+\theta_{1}\right)}, t_{p} \equiv \frac{E_{p_{2}}}{E_{p_{1}}}=\frac{2 \sin \theta_{2} \cos \theta_{1}}{\sin \left(\theta_{2}+\theta_{1}\right) \cos \left(\theta_{2}-\theta_{1}\right)},
$$

where $r_{p}$ and $t_{p}$ are called the amplitude reflection and transmission coefficients respectively.

Similarly, for the incident component with its electric field vector perpendicular to the plane of incidence we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
r_{8} & \equiv \frac{E_{s_{1}}^{\prime}}{E_{s_{1}}}=\frac{\sin \left(\theta_{2}-\theta_{1}\right)}{\sin \left(\theta_{2}+\theta_{1}\right)}, \\
t_{3} \equiv \frac{E_{\theta_{2}}}{E_{s_{1}}}=\frac{2 \sin \theta_{2} \cos \theta_{1}}{\sin \left(\theta_{2}+\theta_{1}\right)} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that $r_{p}=0$ when $\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}=\frac{\pi}{2}$, i.e., when

$$
n_{1} \sin \theta_{1}=n_{2} \cos \theta_{2},
$$

or

$$
\theta_{1}=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}\right) .
$$

This is stated as Brewster's law: When the incident angle is equal to $\tan ^{-1}\left(\theta_{2} / \theta_{1}\right)$, the component with $\mathbf{E}$ in the plane of incidence is not reflected and an unpolarized wave becomes plane polarized on reflection.

\section{8}

Calculate the ratio of the intensities of the reflected wave and the incident wave for a light wave incident normally on the surface of a deep body of water with index of refraction $n=1.33$.

(Wisconsin)

Solution:

Fresnel's equations give for light incident normally

$$
R=\frac{I_{\mathrm{r}}}{I_{\mathrm{i}}}=\left(\frac{n_{2}-n_{1}}{n_{2}+n_{1}}\right)^{2}=0.02 .
$$

While an aquarium is being filled with water (index of refraction $n>$ 1), a motionless fish looks up vertically through the rising surface of the water at a stationary monochromatic plane wave light source. Does the fish see the light source blue-shifted (higher frequency), red-shifted (lower frequency), or is the frequency change identically sero? Explain your reasoning.

(Columbia)

\section{Solution:}

The speed of light propagating through a moving medium of index of refraction $n$ with speed $V$ relative to an observer was given by Fresnel as

$$
u=\frac{c}{n}-V\left(1-\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right),
$$

which has been experimentally verified by Fiseau. The wavelength of light propagating through water is

$$
\lambda_{\text {water }}=\frac{c}{n \nu},
$$

where $c$ and $\nu$ are the speed and frequency of light in vacuum. The frequency of light as seen by the fish is

$$
\nu^{\prime}=\frac{u}{\lambda_{\text {water }}}=\nu-V\left(1-\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{n \nu}{c}\right) .
$$

For $n>1, \nu^{\prime}<\nu$, the fish would see the light red-shifted.

Solar energy at the rate $800 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ strikes a flat solar panel for water heating. If the panel has absorptance $=0.96$ for all wavelengths and the sides are perfect insulators, calculate the maximum temperature of the water. If the absorptance dropped by $1 / 2$, how would this affect the final temperature?

(Wisconsin)

Fig. $3.21$

\section{Solution:}

The Stefan-Boltzmann law gives, under equilibrium,

$$
\alpha \phi=\sigma T^{4}
$$

where $\sigma=5.67 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \mathrm{~K}^{4}$ is Stefan's constant, $\phi$ is the solar energy flux density, and $\alpha$ is the absorptance of the panel. With

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma &=5.67 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \mathrm{~K}^{4}, \\
\alpha &=0.96, \\
\phi &=800 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2},
\end{aligned}
$$

we obtain $T=341 \mathrm{~K}$ for the maximum temperature of the water. As

$$
T \propto \alpha^{1 / 4},
$$

when $\alpha^{\prime}=\alpha / 2$, we have

$$
T^{\prime}=(1 / 2)^{1 / 4} \mathrm{~T}=286 \mathrm{~K} .
$$

Thus if the absorptance dropped by $1 / 2$, the maximum temperature would be $286 \mathrm{~K}$.

\section{6}

Estimate the intensity of moonlight on earth.

(a) In watts per $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

(b) In photons per $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ per second (in the visible range). 

\section{Solution:}

(a) Assume that the sunlight falling on the moon is totally reflected by the moon's surface and that the intensity of the sunlight on the moon is the same as that on earth, which is $I$, the solar constant,

$$
I=1.4 \mathrm{~kW} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \text {. }
$$

Let $r$ be the radius of the moon, $R$ the distance between the moon and the earth. The flux of sunlight reflected from the moon per unit solid angle is $2 \pi r^{2} I / 2 \pi$. A unit area of the earth's surface subtends a solid angle $1 / R^{2}$ at the moon. Hence the intensity of moonlight on earth is

$$
I_{\mathrm{m}}=I(r / R)^{2} \approx 3 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{cm}^{2},
$$

taking $r=1.74 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~km}, R=3.8 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~km}$.

(b) The energy of a photon is $h \nu=h c / \lambda$. For the visible light, $\lambda \approx$ $5000 \AA$, and the number of photons arriving per $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ per second is

$$
I_{\mathrm{m}} /(h c / \lambda)=7.5 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \text {. }
$$

\section{7}

Estimate the efficiency (visible watt/input watt) of 2 of the following light sources: gas light, incandescent bulb, light emitting diode, fluorescent tube, morcury of sodium arc, laser.

(Columbia)

\section{Solution:}

The luminous efficiency of a light source is given by the ratio of the amount of energy radiated per second in the wavelength range $4000-$ $7600 \AA$, which is commonly accepted as the visible range, to the total quantity of energy consumed by the source per second. Besides energy loss by conduction and convection, only a small fraction (the radiant efficiency) of the radiated energy is in the visible range. The luminous efficiencies of some common light sources are as follows:

gas light $0.001$ incandescent bulb $0.02$ fluorescent tube $0.09$ mercury arc $0.08$

sodium arc $0.08$

laser 0.003-0.4 

\section{8}

(b) Energy flux of sunlight at radius of earth's orbit is

$$
10^{6}, 10^{2}, 10^{-1}, 10^{-5} \text { watt } / \mathrm{cm}^{2} \text {. }
$$
bulb?

(c) How many electrons per second flow through the filament of a light

$$
10^{10}, 10^{15}, 10^{19}, 10^{25} \text {. }
$$

(Columbia)

\section{Solution:}

(a) For water, $n=4 / 3$, so the critical angle $i_{c}=\sin ^{-1}(1 / n)=48.6^{\circ}$. Hence the answer is $50^{\circ}$.

(b) $10^{-1} \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

(c) The wattage of a bulb is $W=I V$. With $W \approx 100$ watts, $V \approx 100$ volts, $I \approx 1$ amperes. The number of electrons flowing per second is

$$
\frac{I}{e}=\frac{1}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 10^{19} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \text {. }
$$

\section{9}

Give a description, including the physical principles involved, of the following optical systems:

(a) A lens or mirror arrangement for converting a $10 \mathrm{~cm}$ diameter spherical 1000 candle-power light-source into a $10^{6}$ beam candle-power search light. (Neglect lens or mirror light absorption.)

(b) An instrument capable of producing circularly-polarized light and of analysing light into its circularly-polarized components. (You may assume that the light is monochromatic).

(c) A system (in either the visible or radio-frequency range) for estimating the size of a distant (stellar) source of radiation.

(Columbia) 

\section{Solution:}

(a) A lens or concave mirror would converge light from a source placed near the focal point into a parallel beam as shown in Fig. 3.22.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_11_07_118210d0a2720794b185g-201.jpg?height=382&width=1012&top_left_y=364&top_left_x=210)

Fig. $3.22$

Take the luminous intensity per unit solid angle of the source as $I(=$ 1000 candle-powers). Place the source near a lens or a concave mirror, which converges light within solid angle $\omega_{0}$ into a beam of solid angle $\omega^{\prime}$. The beam candle-power of the search light is

giving

$$
I \frac{\omega_{0}}{\omega^{\prime}}=I\left(\frac{\theta_{0}}{\theta^{\prime}}\right)^{2}=10^{3}\left(\frac{\theta_{0}}{\theta^{\prime}}\right)^{2}=10^{6},
$$

$$
\frac{\theta_{0}}{\theta^{\prime}}=31.6 \text {. }
$$

$\theta^{\prime} / \theta_{0}$ is the angular magnification. By geometry

and we have

$$
\theta^{\prime} f=\theta_{0} x,
$$

$$
x=\frac{f}{31.6} \text {. }
$$

$x$ is the required distance between the source and the focal point of the lens. Placing the source either to the left or the right of the focal point would produce a $10^{6}$ beam candle-power search light. (b)

Fig. $3.23$

Fig. $3.23$ shows an arrangement consisting of a linear polarizer and a quarter-wave plate placed in the beam sequentially, with their optic axes oriented at an angle of $45^{\circ}$. When a beam of unpolarized light passes through the polarizer, it becomes linearly polarized. As its electric field vector makes an angle of $45^{\circ}$ with the optic axis of the quareter-wave plate, the light emerging from the latter is circularly polarized. Beyond this, the arrangement consists of a $\frac{\lambda}{4}$-plate and a linear polarizer for detecting circularly polarized light. After passing through the $\lambda / 4$-plate, the circularly polarized light becomes linearly polarized. Rotating the linear polarizer that comes after it, the emerging intensity changes from maximum to sero showing the linear polarization of the light.

Fig. $3.24$

In Michelson's stellar interferometer (Fig. 3.24), two plane mirrors $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ reflect light from a distant star onto two inclined mirrors $M_{3}$ and $M_{4}$ respectively. These in turn reflect the two parallel beams of light into a telescope objective after passing through the small slits $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ of separation d. Each beam forms an image of the star in the focal plane, and fringes are seen crossing the diffraction disc of the combined image. The visibility of the fringes depends on $h$. As $h$ is increased, the first disappearence of fringes occurs at

$$
h=1.22 \frac{\lambda}{\alpha},
$$

giving the angular sise $\alpha$ of the star disk.

\section{Metallic diffraction grating.}

Purcell (Phys. Rev. 92, 1069) has shown that electromagnetic radiation is emitted from a metallic diffraction grating when a beam of charged particles passes near and parallel to the surface of the grating.

The velocity of the charged particles is $v$ and the grating spacing is $d$. Consider only the light emitted in the plane perpendicular to the grating and containing the particle trajectory. tion?

(b) Suppose the metallic grating is replaced by a transmission grating, e.g., a piece of glass with grooves ruled onto it, still $d$ apart. In what way, if any, will this change the emitted radiation? Explain qualitatively.

(b)

Fis. $3.25$ 

\section{Solution:}

(a) The passing charged particles induce the electrons inside the metallic grating to move. The motion is limited by the very fine wires of the grating and the electrons are decelerated, which causes bremsstrahlung. Consider radiations emitted in XOZ plane (see Fig. 3.25) making an sngle $\theta$ with the normal to the gratings. The radiations emitted from any two adjacent wires would have a delay in time of

$$
\Delta t=\frac{d}{v}-\frac{d \cos \theta}{c} .
$$

When $c \Delta t=m \lambda$, where $m$ is an integer, the radiations interfere constructively. Thus the frequency observed at $\theta$ is given by

$$
\lambda(\theta)=\frac{d}{m}\left(\frac{c}{v}-\cos \theta\right) .
$$

For $m=1, \lambda(\theta)=d\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{v}-\cos \theta\right)$.

(b) As electrons in glass are not free to move, no bremsstrahlung takes place, i.e., no radiation is emitted.
