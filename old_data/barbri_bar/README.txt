Version 1.1 (Updated 11.28.22)

- Added "categories" to final json. (i.e. list of labels for each law exam.)



Version 1.0

1. MATHPIX CONVERSION ERRORS. If there are any conversion errors (e.g. Mathpix incorrectly converted $12,000 to $\$ 12,000$), use the `regexes_clean` variable to eliminate it. `regexes_clean` is a list of lists of length 2 where the first element is the regex capturing the conversion errors and the second element specifies how the error should be converted. For instance, the above example can be corrected using [r"\$\\\$",r"\$"]

2. FILES. See assets folder for files produced in intermediate steps. modified.txt is the original txt file after conversion errors have been eliminated using regexes_clean. sections_i.txt (for 0<=i<=8) contain problems and solutions for the respective sections. 

3. KNOWN BUG. As of version 2.0, this script produces 667 problems (≈ 94.5%) Around 40 problems are lost due to the fact that problemExtract, multiPartExtract, and answerExtract fail to scrape some of the problems from the document. (Try printing len(answerKeys) and len(problems) in convertPandas.)
