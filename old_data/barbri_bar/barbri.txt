\section{HOW TO USE THE MULTISTATE TESTING BOOKS}

The Drills and Released Questions Book ("Drills Book" or 'MDR') is one of three volumes comprising BAR/BRI Multistate Testing. The other two volumes are the Practice Questions Book ("Practice Book" or "MPQ") and the Simulated Exam Book ("Exam Book" or "MSE"). Altogether, BAR/BRI Multistate Testing contains over 2,200 MBE-type multiple choice questions. We do NOT recommend that you do all of the questions that are offered, especially at the expense of reading through the outlines and working on essay questions. Your course will probably provide a "Paced Program" with specific assignments from these books, or you can follow the suggested approach below to focus your MBE preparation.

The Drills Book (this book) is divided into four component parts:

(i) Workshop Testing Drills questions (which should be done in conjunction with the MBE Workshop Testing Drills audio lectures from the BAR/BRI website);

(ii) Practice questions and analytical answers in a mixed subject format;

(iii) A practice exam containing a combination of released (actual) MBE questions and questions prepared by BAR/BRI, with analytical answers for all questions prepared by BAR/BRI; and

(iv) Released MBE questions written by the National Conference of Bar Examiners, arranged by subject, with analytical answers prepared by BAR/BRI.

\section{SUGGESTED STUDY APPROACH}

Step 1: Do the Workshop Testing Drills (the section with shaded margins at the front of this book) for a subject soon after you have completed the substantive lecture on that subject. The Drills contain the following: (i) an introductory workshop with the MBE subject matter outlines and sample questions illustrating the different forms of questions on the MBE; and (ii) 102 simulated MBE questions divided into six tests, one for each Multistate subject. Each test is accompanied by an MBE Workshop audio lecture available at the BAR/BRI website at $\boldsymbol{w} w \boldsymbol{w}$.barbri.com. You should listen to the corresponding lecture from the website after you have worked through the test for a particular subject. The lectures will review all 102 questions and highlight substantive law as well as test-taking techniques.

Step 2: Do questions in the Practice Book. These questions are arranged by subject and grouped into three levels of difficulty. Unless your course instructs otherwise, you should do some of the Introductory Problems in a subject before moving on to Intermediate Questions in that subject. You generally do not need to do all of the questions at these levels before moving on unless that subject is giving you difficulty. Finally, do all of the Advanced Drills questions in each subject. Instead of doing these questions in the Practice Book, you can do them using the BAR/BRI StudySmart ${ }^{\oplus}$ software, which is available at the BAR/BRI website at www.barbri.com.

Step 3: Once you have completed the substantive lectures for all of the MBE subjects, your course will administer the Simulated Exam (in the Exam Book) under timed conditions similar to the actual MBE. BAR/BRI strongly recommends that you take this exam when it is scheduled by your course. There is no substitute for experiencing the time pressures imposed by a pace of $1.8$ minutes per question along with the inevitable distractions of a group setting.

Step 4: If you want exposure to additional questions in a mixed subject format, you can do some of the Mixed Subject questions in this book. If you can, do these questions under simulated exam conditions; ii.

i.e., set aside a block of time (e.g., one hour for 34 questions), find a quiet place to work, and try to answer all of the questions within that period. After a break, or the next day, spend another block of time answering another set of questions. Check the analytical answers only after you have completed all of the questions in the set you are working on.

The Released Questions section: You may wish to analyze some of the Released Questions if you are looking for additional questions to work on, but remember that there are some important limitations to these older questions, as the bar examiners change the "balance" of questions, length of fact patterns, etc., from time to time. Thus, although these are actual MBE questions, they may not be as representative of the questions on your MBE as the newer questions developed by BAR/BRI.

Some final comments: The MBE is not an easy exam. You need to start preparing early-don't try to do all of the practice questions the week before your exam; you'll be overwhelmed-but, on the other hand, don't wear yourself out trying to go through every question from every source. Use our suggested approach and work through enough questions to make yourself feel comfortable with the topics tested and the format of the exam.

Don't become distressed if, even after studying a subject, you still miss some of the questions. No one achieves a perfect score on the MBE.

Good luck, and start studying!

\section{THE FORM OF THE QUESTION}

The questions below are arranged in order from the most common type to the least common type.

\section{DICHOTOMY:}

\section{Question 1}

Collector had a small collection of guns that he generally kept under lock and key, only removing the weapons to clean them or display them at gun shows. One afternoon, Collector took out a World War II vintage handgun for cleaning. He carefully cleaned and oiled the weapon and then reloaded it. Just as he had finished with the reloading, Collector received a phone call from his girlfriend inviting him to dinner. Collector drove off and left the gun on his desk. That night a thief entered Collector's house, which was unlocked, and the gun was stolen. The next day, a convenience store located a few blocks from Collector's house was robbed, and the robber shot and seriously injured Seller, the store owner. The robber ran from the store and dropped his handgun on the way out. The police investigation established that the gun used in the robbery was the handgun stolen from Collector's home.

If Seller sues Collector for his injuries, Seller will:

(A) Not prevail, because Collector did not intend for his gun to be used to commit a battery against Seller.

(B) Not prevail, because Collector is not responsible for the criminal acts of a stranger.

(C) Prevail, because Collector's conduct made it possible for the thief to cause Seller's injuries.

(D) Prevail, if the circumstances should have led Collector to foresee that his gun might be stolen and used for criminal purposes.

\section{BEST OF THE LOT:}

\section{Question 2}

Professor Merrill, in a lecture in her psychology course at a private university, described an experiment in which a group of college students in a neighboring city rushed out and washed cars stopped at traffic lights during the rush hour. She described how people reacted differently-with shock, joy, and surprise. At the conclusion of her report, she said, "You understand, of course, that you are not to undertake this or any other experiment unless you first clear it with me." Four of Merrill's students decided to try the same experiment, but did not clear it with Merrill.

One subject of their experiment, Carr, said, "I was shocked. There were two people on each side of the car. At first I thought negatively. I thought they were going to attack me and thought of driving away. Then I quieted down and decided there were too many dirty cars in the city anyway."

If Carr asserts a claim against the students who washed his car, his best theory is:
(A) Assault.
(B) Negligence.
(C) Invasion of privacy.
(D) False imprisonment.

\section{Question 3}

Defendant is charged with assault and battery. The state's evidence shows that Victim was struck in the face by Defendant's fist.

In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be not guilty of assault and battery?

(A) Defendant had been hypnotized at a party and ordered by the hypnotist to strike the person he disliked the most.

(B) Defendant was suffering from an epileptic seizure and had no control over his motions.

(C) Defendant was heavily intoxicated and was shadow boxing without realizing that Victim was near him.

(D) Defendant, who had just awakened from a deep sleep, was not fully aware of what was happening and mistakenly thought Victim was attacking him. 

\section{INTRODUCTORY WORKSHOP}

\section{JUSTIFY THE RESULT:}

\section{Question 4}

Two years ago, Vinson acquired Fillacre, a one-acre lot improved with a house that was built two years before. When Vinson noticed cracks in the walls of the foundation, he asked a neighbor who was a contractor to take a look at it. The neighbor, who had seen the site while it was under construction, told Vinson that the house had been built on unstable landfill material and that the cracks would only get worse. He told Vinson that he should sell the property as soon as possible. Vinson put the property up for sale and Panda, a first-time home buyer, made an offer after a cursory inspection. The written sales contract that Vinson prepared and Panda signed stated that Fillacre was being sold "as is." After the sale closed and Panda moved in, she noticed that the cracks in the foundation were widening and was told by the neighbor that the house was built on fill. Panda had the foundation rebuilt at great expense and brought an action against Vinson for damages.

If Vinson wins, it will be because:

(A) Vinson was not the builder of the house and thus owed no duty to Panda to disclose defects on the premises.

(B) Panda waived Vinson's duty to disclose any defects on the premises by agreeing to the "as is" provision in the contract.

(C) Vinson took no steps to conceal any defects on the premises.

(D) Vinson's deed for Fillacre was a quitclaim deed with no warranties.

\section{TRUE/FALSE:}

\section{Question 5}

On June 1, Donald offered his ranch for sale to Howard for $\$ 15,000$. Howard received the offer by mail on June 4 , and wrote back to Donald on June 7, inquiring if the price was "fixed" or "negotiable." Donald wrote back that the price was nonnegotiable. Howard then accepted the $\$ 15,000$ offer by a telegram sent June 14. On June 15 , the telegram was delivered to Donald, who then refused to perform.

Which of the following, if any, is correct?

I. Howard's purported acceptance is ineffective because Donald chose the mail as a means of communication.

II. If Donald had mailed a letter of revocation on June 15, before receiving the telegram, no contract would have been formed.

III. Howard is entitled to specific performance.
(A) I. only.
(B) III. only.
(C) Both II. and III.
(D) None is correct.

\section{WORST OF THE LOT:}

\section{Question 6}

In which of the following cases is a conviction of the named defendant for robbery least likely to be upheld?

(A) Johnson forced his way into a woman's home, bound her, and compelled her to tell him that her jewelry was in an adjoining room. Johnson went to the room, took the jewelry, and fled.

(B) A confederate of Brown pushed a man in order to cause him to lose his balance and drop his briefcase. Brown picked up the briefcase and ran off with it.

(C) Having induced a woman to enter his hotel room, Ritter forced her to telephone her maid to tell the maid to bring certain jewelry to the hotel. Ritter locked the woman in the bathroom while he accepted the jewelry from the maid when she arrived.

(D) Hayes unbuttoned the vest of a man too drunk to notice and removed his wallet. A minute later, the victim missed his wallet and accused Hayes of taking it. Hayes pretended to be insulted, slapped the victim, and went off with the wallet. 

\section{CASE SQUIB:}

Questions 7-11 are based on the four case summaries below. For each question, select the case that would be most applicable as a precedent.

(A) Commonwealth v. Mason. Two brothers see a wealthy neighbor's pedigreed dog on the street. They take the dog home, intending to conceal it until the owner offers a reward. Held, guilty of larceny.

(B) Saferite v. State. Two young men saw a motor car on the street with the keys in the ignition lock. They drove the car to a neighboring town with the intention, they said, of visiting the wife of one of them. The car was wrecked on their way back. Conviction of larceny reversed.

(C) People v. Noblett. Defendant, a tenant of a city apartment, advertised it for sublease. Will agreed to sublease for three months, and on March 12 paid Defendant \$550, the total agreed rental. Will was to receive possession on March 20, but possession was never given to him. Held, not guilty of common law larceny.

(D) King v. Pear. From a stablekeeper, Defendant hired a horse to go to Sutton and back, saying he would be back at 8 p.m. He did not return. Investigation showed that Defendant had given a false address, and that he had sold the horse the same day. Conviction of larceny affirmed.

7. Davis paid Realtor $\$ 500$ as a down payment on a house. That night, Davis broke into a hardware store and took a brace and bit. Davis broke into Realtor's office and used the tools to open the safe, where he had seen Realtor place the $\$ 500$. The safe was empty. Davis's fingerprints on the tools, left lying in front of the safe, led to his arrest. He is charged with larceny of the tools.

8. Smith placed a newspaper advertisement reading, "Wanted: responsible man to collect for large firm. $\$ 500$ security required. Address Box 66, Times." Vincent answered the ad and was called on by Smith, who said he represented Ames Advertising Agency. He took Vincent to the office of the company (a large actual firm), but as they were about to enter the building Smith said, "There is Mr. Ames now," and introduced him to a companion of Smith who impersonated Ames. The result of the conversation was that the false Ames agreed to hire Vincent. It was agreed that Vincent would draw $\$ 500$ from the bank to put up as security, and that this money would be placed in a bank and Vincent given a certificate of deposit in his own name. They went to the bank where Vincent gave Smith the money, after which Smith and "Ames" disappeared. Smith was later charged with larceny.

9. Jones, angry at a neighbor with whom he had quarreled, for revenge surreptitiously removed a piece of stone statuary from the neighbor's garden and concealed it in his garage. He intended to replace it a day or two later, after giving the neighbor a chance to feel bad over its being stolen. Suspecting who was guilty, the neighbor had Jones arrested and charged with larceny.

10. Harris, a heroin addict, broke into a home and took several cameras and watches, which he promptly pawned to obtain cash with which to purchase a "fix." Harris was later charged with larceny of the cameras and watches.

11. Allison told Mark that he, Allison, was the legal representative for a syndicate that had a photoelectric machine for making counterfeit money, and to prove that the money was good enough to "pass anywhere," Allison showed what he said was one of the counterfeit $\$ 10$ bills. He said that if Mark would invest $\$ 1,000$, the syndicate would pay him counterfeit money in the amount of $\$ 10,000$. Mark paid the $\$ 1,000$ to Allison, who then disappeared. Allison is caught and charged with larceny.

\section{Constitutional Law}

\section{Question 1}

St. Minny, a town with a population of 30,000 , was located on the west bank of a small river. Immediately across the river, on the east bank, was Paulopolis, a city of 60,000 . Over the years, many civic improvement groups urged that the two municipalities be merged into "Minnypaulos," a single city of 90,000 souls. The arguments in favor of merger stressed savings to taxpayers accruing from the elimination of duplicate services. Proposals to merge the two places had appeared as referenda on the ballot on two separate occasions. Although the voters of Paulopolis approved each proposal by heavy margins, the voters of St. Minny, fearing that control of the government would be in the hands of more populous Paulopolis, rejected the referendum proposals by more than two to one.

To avoid the failure of yet another such referendum, a new proposal was made for the governance of the proposed combined city. For a period of 20 years, beginning at the date of the merger, the city council of the merged city would consist of six persons. The former Paulopolis would be divided into three council districts, as would the former city of St. Minny. Thus, each St. Minny council representative would be elected from a district with a population of 10,000, while the Paulopolis districts would contain 20,000 persons each. A mayor would be elected at large. The proposal was placed on the ballot and was carried by large majorities in both St. Minny and Paulopolis. Representatives from Paulopolis and St. Minny carved each former city into three council electoral districts. Three Paulopolis taxpayers filed suit to enjoin the holding of an election with council districts of such disparate proportions.

Which of the following represents the plaintiffs' best constitutional argument?
(A) The government of the merged cities is not a republican form of government.
(B) The plaintiffs and other Paulopolitans have been denied equal protection of the law.

(C) The plaintiffs and other Paulopolitans have been denied the privileges and immunities of citizenship as guaranteed by Article IV. of the federal Constitution.

(D) The plaintiffs and other Paulopolitans have been denied due process of law.

Questions 2-3 are based on the following fact situation:

An act of Congress provides for the payment of Social Security benefits to the disabled children of deceased workers. A complex set of regulations carefully defines the meaning of the term "disabled." The benefits are payable even after the child reaches his or her age of majority, but terminate automatically when the recipient marries, unless the recipient marries a person who is also disabled, in which case the Social Security payments continue.

Dorit has been disabled since birth, and her father died in a coal mine cave-in when Dorit was 14 years of age. She has received Social Security benefits since her father's death. However, at age 25, Dorit married Jack, who is not disabled, and her Social Security benefits were summarily terminated. She files suit in federal district court, seeking to compel the government to restore her benefits. She asserts, among other things, that there is no logical reason why she should be deprived of benefits when unmarried disabled persons and disabled persons who marry other disabled persons continue to receive them. 

\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW}

2. Which of the following provides the strongest constitutional basis for Dorit's suit?
(A) The privileges and immunities of national citizenship protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
(B) The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(C) The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
(D) The prohibitions against bills of attainder.

3. Which of the following is the strongest ground to defend the constitutionality of the federal statute in question?

(A) Congress's power over federal expenditures is plenary, and Congress has discretion to spend money from the Federal Treasury in whatever way it wishes.

(B) Because there is no constitutional entitlement to Social Security payments, Congress is free to condition them as it sees fit.

(C) The classification imposed by this statute is reasonable, inasmuch as it will save the national government a substantial amount of money.

(D) Congress could rationally conclude that a disabled child of a deceased worker who is unmarried or who marries another disabled person is more likely to be needy than a disabled person who is married to a person who is not disabled.

\section{Question 4}

To help alleviate the burdens of poverty and perhaps to help cut the welfare rolls, the state legislature of Margate passed legislation establishing State Family Counseling Centers throughout the state. The legislature recognized that much of the "welfare and poverty problem" was centered on poor single-parent households headed by a woman. Therefore, it decreed in the legislation that all counseling would be free for single mothers with an income of less than $\$ 20,000$ per year. Others would have to pay fees for the counseling on a sliding scale depending upon income. The counseling services available at the State Family Counseling Centers included classes on parenting, anti-substance abuse programs, and financial counseling. The counseling centers were popular and other states considered copying the Margate model.

Peter's wife had died recently of a drug overdose, and he was left to care for their two children (ages two and four) on an income of approximately $\$ 7,000$ per year. Peter had no idea how he could manage to care for the two children and himself on his small paychecks. He heard about the State Family Counseling Centers and went to the closest one for financial counseling. Peter was told that he would have to pay a $\$ 50$ fee for the counseling. Peter had $\$ 10$ in his pocket, which he needed for bus fare home and to feed his children until his check, due in five days, arrived. Peter became very angry when he learned that single mothers in his situation were entitled to free counseling while single fathers were not. A public-interest law firm agreed to take Peter's case and filed suit in federal court, asking that Peter be allowed to take advantage of the free counseling services because the law establishing them discriminated against males.

To win the case:

(A) Peter must show that the law is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest favoring mothers over fathers.

(B) Peter must show that the state has no compelling interest in favoring mothers over fathers.

(C) Margate must show that favoring mothers over fathers is substantially related to an important governmental interest.

(D) Margate must show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest favoring mothers over fathers. 

\section{Question 5}

In 2000, Rogan Josh, then age 15, emigrated with his family from Dopyaza, an Asian country. Although Josh maintained Dopyazan citizenship, he held resident alien status and complied with all federal laws and regulations regarding maintenance of resident alien status. Upon arrival in the United States, Josh, his parents, and his siblings took up residence in the state of New Jingo. In 2003, Rogan Josh began'a course of studies in petroleum engineering at New Jingo University, a state institution. Because he was a resident of New Jingo, Josh qualified for the "in-state" tuition rate. The "nonresident" tuition rate was 10 times the in-state rate, and it would be impossible for Josh to attend New Jingo University if he were required to pay the nonresident tuition.

In 2005, the legislature of New Jingo passed a statute denying in-state tuition rates at any statesupported college or university for any resident aliens who were citizens of "any country which, during the previous five-year period, has held citizens of the United States as hostages." Due to an international dispute between the United States and the government of Dopyaza, the Dopyazan government had held six American citizens as hostages for a four-month period in 2002. The registrar of New Jingo University, where Josh has successfully completed two years of study, informed Josh that he would have to pay the nonresident tuition rate in order to begin his junior year. Josh cannot afford to pay the tuition.

If Josh files an appropriate suit asking the federal courts to strike down the New Jingo statute, which of the following is his best argument? (A) Because higher education is now so important for earning a livelihood, it has become a fundamental right protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(B) Resident aliens cannot be blamed in retrospect for actions of their governments and, therefore, the New Jingo statute violates the constitutional prohibition of ex post facto laws.

(C) Alienage is a suspect category under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and New Jingo has not met the appropriate standard to burden Josh.

(D) Attending a state-supported university in a state where one is a legal resident is a property right that may not be taken away without due process of law. 

\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW}

\section{Question 6}

The Classical School is a private school located in the state of Romanova. Under an aidto-education statute passed by the state legislature a few years ago, The Classical School and certain other private schools receive state benefits. Among those received by The Classical School are: (i) free textbooks from the state, (ii) an exemption from state taxes, and (iii) $20 \%$ of its operating budget in the form of state grants. The remaining $80 \%$ of The Classical School's budget is covered by tuition fees and by donations from alumni and others. The Classical School is licensed by the state, but the state has no requirement for certification and licensure of teachers in private schools.

Timon was hired to teach history at The Classical School and was given the standard three-year contract given to teachers in their first stint at the school. Timon, who had been a student activist in college, was annoyed every day when he faced classes wearing the uniform required by The Classical School. Timon kept his mouth shut until he was chosen, in the fall term of his second year, to give the monthly "History Enrichment Lecture" to the entire school. The topic of Timon's lecture was Europe between the two world wars. Timon's lecture was factual, balanced, and nonopinionated, until, at the end of his lecture, he told the assembled students, "We've talked a lot this afternoon about the rise of fascism, but think about this: there is absolutely no qualitative difference between those uniforms you're wearing and those worn by the Hitler Youth. If you had any gumption you'd organize a protest against having to wear them." After the speech, Timon was called to the administrative office by the headmaster and fired on the spot, despite Timon's protests that he had almost two years left on his contract. Timon requested a hearing and was curtly told to leave the premises of the school immediately.

Charging that his constitutional rights had been violated, Timon filed suit in federal district court. Timon will: (A) Succeed, because the school's action violated Timon's freedom of speech rights.

(B) Succeed, because Timon has been denied due process of law.

(C) Fail, because Timon was not in his position long enough to acquire property rights in his job.

(D) Fail, because assistance and involvement by the state did not result in the private school's action being conduct by the state. 

\section{Question 7}

The state of Petrolia derived most of its income from extractive industries, especially its extensive oil and natural gas fields. However, a worldwide drop in the price of petroleum was severe enough to cause a depression in Petrolia, and the state's unemployment rate soared. To counter the effect the depression was having on Petrolia's citizens, the state legislature passed a law requiring all employers operating in the state's oil and natural gas fields to give preference in hiring to residents of Petrolia. The bill banned the hiring of nonresidents unless no other qualified person could be found to fill an oilfield or natural gas field position. Under prevailing economic conditions, the statute was tantamount to a total ban on hiring of nonresidents because so many unemployed oil and gas workers had been created by the depression and little new exploration was taking place.

"Roughnecks," as oilfield workers call themselves, tend to be an itinerant lot, moving from place to place as new fields are brought into production. Driller was a 48-year-old roughneck whose permanent residence was in Louisiana. He had worked on offshore rigs in the Gulf waters off his home state, but Driller had also worked in Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska, Kuwait, Indonesia, and Venezuela. Upon hearing that one of the few independent companies actively exploring in Petrolia had struck a new field in that state, Driller drove to the field office of Ewing Exploration Company in Petrolia and applied for a job. Looking at Driller's extensive experience as described on Driller's resume, Ewing's personnel officer sadly shook his head. He indicated that Driller's qualifications were better than anyone's working in the field, but that he had more applications from experienced Petrolia residents than he had jobs to offer. The sole reason given for not hiring Driller was the preferential hiring statute favoring state residents. Driller filed suit in federal district court challenging the statute.

The court should rule in favor of:
(A) Petrolia, because employment discrimina- tion is only unconstitutional if it involves race, religion, alienage, or sex.

(B) Petrolia, because the state's interest in hiring local residents outweighs the interest of nonresidents.

(C) Driller, because the law denies him the privileges and immunities of state citizenship.

(D) Driller, because the preferential hiring law impairs Driller's rights under the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution.

\section{Question 8}

In response to growing concern over public health issues, Congress passed legislation permitting states to completely ban the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products. The legislation was subsequently upheld by the United States Supreme Court. The state of Jefferson, like most states, did not enact a complete ban on tobacco products. However, it passed a compromise measure that banned all ads for cigarettes and tobacco products by any print or broadcast media located in the state.

A state tobacco distributor that wished to advertise in local newspapers brings an action in federal court to challenge the state statute. The court will probably find the statute:

(A) Unconstitutional, because by choosing not to exercise its right to impose a complete ban on the sale of tobacco products, the state can no longer claim that the regulation of advertising serves a substantial government interest.

(B) Unconstitutional, because the right to ban all truthful advertising for a product is not automatically justified by the right to ban the sale of a product entirely.

(C) Constitutional, because the state's power to ban advertising for a product is implicit in its power to ban the product altogether.

(D) Constitutional, because the ban on advertising constitutes a restriction on commercial speech that is rationally related to the legitimate state interest in reducing the use of tobacco products. 

\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW}

\section{Question 9}

The citizens of Tidytown prided themselves on the neatness and beauty of the town of 30,000 people. This was reflected in the tough anti-litter ordinances that had been passed by the city council. Littering offenses carried fines of up to $\$ 500$ and were always very strictly enforced. Center Park was located near the downtown business area of Tidytown. Signs at each of the park entrances, and on the many trash barrels situated throughout the park, carried conspicuous warnings against littering.

On October 15, a group of students from nearby colleges chose Center Park in Tidytown as the site for their demonstration against the proliferation of weapons in space. Approximately 125 students gathered in the park with placards and banners, and several speakers addressed the group. One of the speakers, Demagoga, during the course of her speech, walked to one of the trash barrels and dumped the contents out on the ground. As she did so, she told her listeners, "This is what outer space is starting to look like, cluttered with the trash of nuclear weapons." The meeting broke up 15 minutes later. The students left the park peacefully, but no one bothered to pick up the trash or right the overturned barrel. Demagoga was arrested pursuant to the Tidytown littering ordinance. She was fined $\$ 500$ after her conviction.

If Demagoga seeks to have her conviction set aside on constitutional grounds, she is likely to:

(A) Lose, because the anti-littering ordinance furthers an important governmental interest and is not aimed at communication.

(B) Lose, because Demagoga was convicted for her conduct rather than for what she said.

(C) Win, because Demagoga's conduct constituted symbolic speech.

(D) Win, unless the town can prove a compelling interest in its anti-litter laws.

\section{Question 10}

A statute in the state of Lemon forbids employers from discriminating on the basis of religion; however, an exception provides that established religions that employ persons to engage in nonprofit activities may be exempted from this rule. A new religion sprang up called the Church of the Sunrise. It espoused a number of nontraditional views, among which was the belief that the sun is really a temple that is moved across the sky by a powerful race of aliens. When the Church gained enough members to open a meeting place, it advertised for clerical and maintenance workers. Patricia applied for a position and was told that she would be hired if she converted to the Church of the Sunrise religion. Patricia refused to do so and complained to the state of Lemon human relations board. After investigating, the board concluded that the Church was not an established religion and its beliefs were not plausible. It ruled that the religious exemption would not be applicable and ordered the Church to hire Patricia. Church officials filed an action in federal district court challenging the board's refusal to apply the exemption.

How is the court likely to rule?

(A) The board may not refuse to apply the exemption unless it can prove scientifically that the Church's beliefs are false.

(B) The board may not refuse to apply the exemption because it does not have compelling grounds for favoring other religions over this one.

(C) The entire exemption scheme is unconstitutional because it does not have a secular purpose and has a primary effect of advancing religion.

(D) The board may refuse to apply the exemption because the state has the power to deny any religion the right to discriminate in its hiring. 

\section{Question 11}

With an election approaching, Congress passed a statute requiring that all full-time employees, including state and municipal employees, be paid overtime for any work over 40 hours per week, or be otherwise compensated through time off or vacation time.

Patchquilt was a municipality located in a very warm climate. Many Patchquilt residents were on welfare, and the town contained no major industry or shopping district to bolster its tax base. Patchquilt employed only three refuse collectors and asserted reasonably that it could not afford to hire more. However, during the warmest times of the year, extra refuse collections were routine because of the city council's fear that rotting garbage in the hot climate could contribute to the spread of disease. During the hottest months, the three refuse collectors in Patchquilt regularly worked well beyond the 40 hours per week standard. Because of normal vacation time and the normally heavy garbage collection schedule, it would not be possible to give the refuse collectors additional time off during the cooler months, which were not always very cool, without hiring additional refuse collectors. Patchquilt brings an action in federal district court, asserting that the federal statute requiring overtime pay to municipal workers is unconstitutional.

The court should hold the statute: (A) Constitutional, as a reasonable application of the Necessary and Proper Clause.

(B) Constitutional, because regulation of state and local employees is within the ambit of federal power over interstate commerce.

(C) Unconstitutional, because regulation of state and local employees is an issue reserved to the states.

(D) Unconstitutional, because the state police power to promote health and safety precludes federal action in this case. 

\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW}

\section{Question 12}

Large semi-trailer trucks ordinarily used either "Gripper" tires or "Grabber" tires. There was some difference in the design of the tires, and a number of tire manufacturers made both types of tires, which were deemed to be equally safe by independent testing labs. Most state statutes and vehicle regulations allowed the use of both types of tires on state highways. However, State Plum and State Apricot had laws on their books permitting only Grippers and banning Grabbers. State Grapefruit, on the other hand, had a statute allowing the use of Grabbers, and banning Grippers, on its state highways. The National Trucking Board, a trade association of interstate trucking firms, brought suit to have the laws of State Plum and State Apricot declared unconstitutional. The case eventually reached the United States Supreme Court, which struck down the Apricot and Plum statutes as undue burdens on interstate commerce.

The National Trucking Board then brought suit in federal court to have the State Grapefruit statute banning Grippers struck down. The Grapefruit attorney general argued that the Grapefruit statute did not burden interstate commerce because Grabbers were now legal in all 50 states. The case eventually reached the United States Supreme Court.

How should the Court rule on the constitutionality of the statute?

(A) Constitutional, because there is no difference in safety between Grippers and Grabbers.

(B) Constitutional, because the states have the power to regulate safety on their highways.

(C) Unconstitutional, because it is an undue burden on interstate commerce.

(D) Unconstitutional, because it violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

\section{Question 13}

The President of the United States entered into a bilateral agreement with Nerddistan, a sovereign nation, regarding the probate of estates. One part of the agreement provided that, should a citizen of Nerddistan die owning property in the United States or its Commonwealths or Territories, the executor or administrator appointed in Nerddistan should have the power to deal with such property and a separate American administrator or executor need not be appointed. Reciprocal rights were extended to United States citizens who died owning property in Nerddistan. Tadzik, a citizen of Nerddistan, died owning property in the United States state of Gulfstream. Tadzik's will appointed Elwwan, a citizen of Nerddistan, as executor. A law in the state of Gulfstream requires that all property left by will within the state of Gulfstream be probated by an executor or administrator who is a resident of Gulfstream.

If Elwwan desires to act as executor of the estate and properly distribute the Gulfstream property in accordance with Tadzik's will, should he be allowed to do so, notwithstanding the Gulfstream statute?

(A) No, because the probate of real property within the state is within the exclusive purview of the state.

(B) No, because an executive agreement is not a treaty, and state law takes precedence over executive agreements.

(C) Yes, because executive agreements supersede state laws.

(D) Yes, because executive agreements are entitled to full faith and credit. 

\section{Question 14}

Congress passed a statute providing that if the President deployed more than 1,000 United States Armed Forces personnel in a foreign country where "combat conditions" existed, the President was required to return such Armed Forces to the United States within 60 days or formally seek a declaration of war from Congress. The statute further provided that, if Congress failed to declare war within 30 days of the President's request, the President was required to return the Armed Forces to the United States.

After several tense incidents, the President ordered 10,000 troops from the Army and Marine Corps to land in Culebra, a Central American republic. The American forces had been fired on and had fired back, and they had continued to receive and inflict casualties. The 60-day period passed, but the President refused to go to Congress to seek a declaration of war, and in a televised address to the nation accused Congress of an unconstitutional attempt to usurp powers denied to it by the Constitution.

What is Congress's best argument for the constitutionality of the statute?

(A) In making decisions concerning foreign affairs, the President must first obtain the advice and consent of the Senate.

(B) The statute does not limit the President's power to repel invasions.

(C) The President cannot institute military actions in foreign countries without a declaration of war, and only Congress has the right to declare war.

(D) The statute reflects the balance between the legislature and the executive branch in their shared control over the Armed Forces.

\section{Question 15}

In the wake of revelations regarding safety hazards and toxic emissions from plants processing radioactive materials, a bill was introduced into the legislature of State Green barring the processing of plutonium, a radioactive artificial element, in State Green. After extensive public hearings it was clear that the bill had strong support in both houses of the state legislature and that, if called to a vote, the bill would pass easily. Governor Luddite had also made a major speech announcing that he would sign such a bill. However, a few members of the legislature raised questions as to the bill's constitutionality. The constitution of State Green provides that the state supreme court may hand down declaratory judgments, and the question of the bill's constitutionality was brought before the state supreme court. The court ruled that the bill, in the form it was introduced into the legislature, is constitutional.

There is only one plutonium processing plant in State Green. It is owned and operated by Master Minerals Corporation. The plant operates under contract with the federal government and is highly profitable for Master Minerals. Master Minerals seeks to have the judgment of the state supreme court overturned, and its attorneys have filed appropriate papers to bring the case before the United States Supreme Court.

The Court should:
(A) Not hear the matter, because no case or controversy exists.
(B) Review the state court's opinion and reverse it.
(C) Review the state court's opinion and affirm it.
(D) Not review the state court's opinion, because it is based on an independent state ground.

\section{Question 16}

Rupert held a majority ownership interest in one of the three daily newspapers in City, as well as numerous other media outlets across the country. When a popular City radio station was put on the market, he entered into negotiations to purchase it. However, the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") blocked the sale on the basis of a regulation forbidding ownership of a radio or television station to any entity owning a daily newspaper in the same city. The next year, however, the FCC suspended enforcement of that regulation to permit the radio station to be sold to Sumner, the owner of another daily newspaper in City. Rupert filed an action in federal district court seeking to enjoin the sale.

The court should:

(A) Decide the case on the merits, because Rupert can claim that the FCC's unequal treatment of the two transactions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

(B) Decide the case on the merits, because Rupert can claim that the FCC's refusal to allow him to own the station violated his freedom of speech rights under the First Amendment.

(C) Dismiss the action, because Rupert cannot show that enjoining the transaction will eliminate any injury that he might have suffered.

(D) Dismiss the action, because the federal government has the power to regulate ownership of the broadcast media.

\section{Question 17}

The state of Plains was the headquarters of Bushel Basket Ministries, which had been characterized by the government as a "religious cult." Seeking to broaden his influence, the leader of Bushel Basket, Reverend Bill E. Bob, decided that the state legislature would serve as an effective pulpit for his religious views by giving him a great deal of media exposure and direct mail resources. The state of Plains had no provision barring members of the clergy from serving as legislators. Bob entered a race that already had several other candidates and took advantage of the state's liberal voter registration laws by having many of his followers move into the district a month before the election. Bob's subsequent victory in the race shocked the political establishment and prompted a citizens' group to file a lawsuit in federal district court. The suit, invoking the Establishment Clause, sought to enjoin the state from seating Bob in the legislature or expending any state funds to provide him with legislative privileges. Bob moved to dismiss the lawsuit.

Should the court grant Bob's motion?
(A) Yes, because the Eleventh Amendment bars this type of action against a state by its citizens.
(B) Yes, because a political question is in- volved.
(C) No, because citizens have standing to challenge government expenditures that may violate the Establishment Clause.
(D) No, because the lawsuit is not seeking damages from the state.

\section{Question 1}

Babe was a professional baseball player who was known both for his prowess at the plate and his perceived "heart of gold." One day, Babe was visiting a sick boy named Jimmy in the hospital. Babe was touched by Jimmy's will to live despite a very poor prognosis. In a moment of weakness, Babe told Jimmy that in consideration of Jimmy's courage, he would do anything that Jimmy asked. Jimmy's eyes momentarily gleamed as he asked Babe to "hit a homer for me in your next game." Babe replied, "Sure kid." As Babe was leaving Jimmy's hospital room, Jimmy's father, Joe, pulled Babe aside and told Babe, "It would mean a lot to Jimmy if you would hit a home run for him in your next game. The medicinal value of raising Jimmy's spirits would be priceless." Babe replied, "Hey man, we all have problems. I don't work for the Make a Wish Foundation." Undaunted, Joe repeated that it would really raise Jimmy's spirits if Babe would hit a homer, and as incentive, Joe told Babe that he would pay Babe $\$ 5,000$ if Babe did hit a home run in his next game. Babe replied, "You've got a deal." To raise his chances of collecting the $\$ 5,000$ from Joe, Babe took extra batting practice before his next game, and the practice paid off because in his next game, Babe hit two home runs. During a post-game interview, Babe explained, "I did it for little Jimmy, who is in the hospital." After showering, Babe went directly to Joe's house and asked Joe for $\$ 5,000$. Babe's contract with his ball club does not forbid him from accepting money from fans for good performance.

If Joe refuses to pay and Babe brings an action against Joe for damages, which of the following is correct under the modern trend in contract law?

(A) Babe can recover the $\$ 5,000$ because the preexisting duty rule does not apply where the duty is owed to a third person.

(B) Babe can recover the $\$ 5,000$ if he can prove that the value of the home run to Jimmy is at least $\$ 5,000$. (C) Babe cannot recover from Joe because Babe had a preexisting duty to use his best efforts to hit home runs.

(D) Babe cannot recover from Joe because, even under the modern trend, moral consideration is not valid.

\section{Question 2}

On January 2, 1993, Cheap lent Deadbeat $\$ 1,000$ and the parties agreed in writing that Deadbeat would repay Cheap on or before January 2, 1994. Deadbeat failed to repay Cheap, and on January 6,1999, Cheap phoned Deadbeat and told him, "If you'll pay me $\$ 600$ now, I'll forget all about that unpaid $\$ 1,000$ debt." Deadbeat agreed orally and then sent Cheap a signed letter which stated, "I, Deadbeat, agree to pay Cheap $\$ 600$." Deadbeat never paid Cheap the $\$ 600$ and Cheap sued Deadbeat. The statute of limitations on suits for debt in the jurisdiction is five years.

Cheap is entitled to recover:

(A) $\$ 1,000$, because the agreement by Deadbeat to pay Cheap $\$ 600$ revived the original $\$ 1,000$ obligation.

(B) $\$ 600$, because Deadbeat's moral obligation to pay Cheap $\$ 1,000$ became the consideration for Deadbeat's agreement to pay Cheap $\$ 600$.

(C) Nothing, because the statute of limitations has run.

(D) Nothing, because no additional consideration was provided to support Deadbeat's agreement to pay Cheap $\$ 600$.

\section{Question 3}

For a number of years, United Leasing has been in charge of leasing the luxury skyboxes at City Sports Stadium, home of the local professional basketball team. During this time, it annually sent to chief executives of area businesses personalized "invitations" to lease skyboxes for the season. The invitations, which were always sent out several months before each season began, contained detailed price terms and language stating that the deadline for responding was 10 weeks before the start of the season and that all leases were subject to the approval of the management of United Leasing. Executives at Multimedia Marketing had always responded to their invitation immediately by registered mail because they found it very worthwhile to lease a skybox to entertain their clients. During the five years that they had responded affirmatively to the invitation, they never received any additional communications from United Leasing regarding approval, but the tickets and an invoice would arrive about a week before the season began.

Several months before the current season, Multimedia received and immediately responded to its invitation. Two weeks before the season began, a stunning trade brought the league's most popular star to the City basketball team, prompting a dramatic increase in the demand for tickets. A few days later, Multimedia, which had already scheduled in a number of clients to attend games in its skybox, received a notice from United Leasing stating that management had not approved Multimedia's lease of the skybox for this season. In a separate announcement to all area businesses, United Leasing announced that all available skyboxes would be leased for three- or five-year terms, and that an auction of the leases would be conducted if the demand exceeded the supply.

Multimedia decided that it was not financially feasible to commit itself to anything longer than a one-year lease. It sent a letter to United Leasing, stating that a contract was created between the parties and that United Leasing will be in breach if it does not perform. Is Multimedia correct in its assertions?
(A) Yes, because United Leasing's failure to reject Multimedia's offer within a reason- able time constituted an acceptance under the circumstances.
(B) Yes, because United Leasing's "invitation" to Multimedia was an offer, which Multi- media accepted.
(C) No, because United Leasing was entitled to reject Multimedia's offer when it did.
(D) No, but Multimedia would be able to recover reliance damages from United Leasing under a quasi-contract theory. 

\section{Question 4}

Bernaise, the sole proprietor of Bernaise Distributors, a food service and food brokerage concern, entered into oral negotiations with Hollandaise, president and chief executive officer of Holsauce, a corporation that manufactured gourmet food products for restaurants and select retail outlets. Bernaise wished to secure an exclusive distributorship for Holsauce products in the six New England states. After some discussion, Bernaise and Hollandaise agreed on all salient points and shook hands on the deal. They agreed further that Hobson, Holsauce's general counsel, would reduce the agreement to writing and that the agreement would become effective after it was drawn up and initialed by Hobson and by Barker, Bernaise's counsel. Hobson duly committed the agreement to writing and sent the writing to Barker, but without initialing it first. Barker looked over the agreement, made no changes, initialed it, and mailed the agreement to Hobson on May 1. On May 2, Hollandaise decided that Bechamel would be a better distributor than Bernaise. Therefore, also on May 2, Hollandaise had Hobson telephone Barker, telling him, "The deal's off." Barker responded, "The heck it is. We have an enforceable contract." Hobson received the written agreement with Barker's initials on it on May 3. According to Hollandaise's instructions, Holsauce began to distribute its products in New England through Bechamel.

If Bernaise files suit against Hollandaise and Holsauce for breach, he is likely to:

(A) Prevail, because the mailing of the written agreement to Barker constituted an irrevocable offer.

(B) Prevail, because Bernaise and Hollandaise entered into a valid oral contract.

(C) Not prevail, because Hobson never initialed the written agreement and there was, therefore, failure of an express condition.

(D) Not prevail, because Hobson's phone call to Barker constituted a valid revocation before acceptance.

\section{Question 5}

Fat Goose Foods ("FGF") was a manufacturer of quality pates and terrines made from imported goose livers and truffles. In a written agreement between FGF and Gourmet Mart ("GM"), a retail seller of fine quality foods, FGF agreed to "sell all output of Fat Goose Foods liver pate to Gourmet Mart," and GM agreed to "sell Fat Goose Foods pates exclusively." The agreement went on to state that GM would pay $\$ 150$ for each 10 -loaf container of pates ordered from FGF. The agreement between GM and FGF also contained the statement, "either party may cancel this contract after two months upon giving reasonable notice to the other party." Assume that, after FGF faithfully filled GM's orders for six months, FGF determined that it was becoming too costly to operate the special oven used to roast the pate loaves. The oven had been manufactured in Belgium in 1937, but the plant that manufactured the oven was destroyed by bombing during World War II, and no more of the ovens were produced after 1940 . It would be difficult and expensive to find a suitable substitute, and when the oven malfunctioned, replacement parts were extremely difficult to find and very costly as well. FGF, therefore, decided to get out of the pate business entirely and to use its supply of goose livers to make a German-style liver sausage. FGF notified GM of its decision and the reasons for it, and shortly thereafter stopped shipping pate to GM. GM sued FGF, demanding that FGF continue to ship pate to GM or pay monetary damages to GM.

Will GM prevail?
(A) Yes, because it was not impossible for FGF to perform.
(B) Yes, because FGF assumed the risk that making pate would become expensive.
(C) No, because the expense of fixing the oven provides a good faith reason for stopping production.
(D) No, because the cancellation provision made the contract illusory.

Questions 6-7 are based on the following fact situation:

Jenny, a general contractor, advertised in a trade publication that she planned to bid on the construction of a new building to be located in the Civic Mall. The advertisement welcomed bids from subcontractors to perform various functions, such as plumbing, electrical work, and masonry. The lowest electrical bid was from Ohmco, who bid $\$ 20,000$. The lowest plumbing bid was from Plunger, who bid $\$ 10,000$. Jenny used Ohmco's and Plunger's bids in preparing her general bid. At 2 p.m., on June 22, Jenny submitted her general bid. At 3 p.m., Plunger called her and said, 'I'm sorry, Jenny, but I made a mistake on that bid I submitted to you; I can't possibly do that plumbing work for a dime less than $\$ 12,000$." Jenny told him, "I can't do anything about that because I've already submitted my general bid." Jenny was awarded the contract.

6. Assume for purposes of this question only that after receiving the contract, Jenny hired Flusher to do the plumbing work on the building at a cost of $\$ 12,000$. She now sues Plunger for damages. Jenny is entitled to recover:
(A) $\$ 10,000$.
(B) $\$ 2,000$, which represents the differ- ence between Plunger's bid and the amount Jenny had to pay for plumbing work.
(C) Nothing, because $\$ 12,000$ was a reasonable amount to pay for the work performed.
(D) Nothing, because Jenny did not accept Plunger's bid before it was withdrawn.

7. Assume for purposes of this question only that Jenny used Ohmco's $\$ 20,000$ electrical bid to prepare her general bid, but, after Jenny was awarded the contract, she decided to hire subcontractor Wattco to perform the electrical work. Wattco had bid $\$ 21,500$. Ohmco sues Jenny for damages. Will Ohmco prevail?
(A) Yes, because there was an implied acceptance that Jenny would use the lowest bid for electrical contracting.
(B) Yes, because Ohmco's bid was an offer for an option contract that was accepted upon acceptance of the general contract.
(C) No, because Jenny never communi- cated an acceptance of Ohmco's offer.
(D) No, because Jenny's advertisement for bids did not constitute an offer. 

\section{Question 8}

On April 1, Stan, a law student, agreed to sell his prized possession - an antique dictionaryto Betsy for $\$ 1,500$, so that he could pay for his bar review course. Because Stan did not have to pay for his course until April 30, the written contract between Stan and Betsy provided that the dictionary would not be delivered to Betsy until April 20, thus giving Stan a last few extra days to peruse the dictionary's pages. Late on April 15, a terrible fire swept through Stan's apartment building and the dictionary was destroyed. Firefighters determined that the blaze started when Hugh, the tenant living below Stan, fell asleep while doing his taxes and dropped his cigarette onto his paperwork. Fortunately for Stan, he had insurance that covered all of his damages, including compensation for the destroyed dictionary. On April 20, Stan told Betsy of the fire, but still demanded payment, claiming that Betsy was the equitable owner of the dictionary when it was destroyed, and explaining that she could have obtained insurance on the dictionary had she wanted to, since she had an insurable interest in the dictionary as soon as the contract was made. Betsy refused to pay. Stan brings an action against Betsy for the $\$ 1,500$.

Who will prevail?
(A) Betsy, because Stan was fully compensated for his dictionary and making Betsy pay would therefore result in unjust enrich- ment.
(B) Betsy, because destruction of the dictionary avoids the contract and discharges her duty to pay.
(C) Stan, because when he contracted with Betsy, the risk of loss passed to her.
(D) Stan, because of the doctrine of equitable conversion.

Questions 9-10 are based on the following fact situation:

Popeye owned a large fleet of buses. He was fortunate enough to have won the contract to bus all the schoolchildren in a large midwestern city and most of its surrounding suburbs. He purchased a number of new vehicles to expand his fleet. Popeye had farmed out the maintenance of the buses to a number of different repair shops, but he now desired the consistent results obtainable from dealing with one repair and maintenance operation. He therefore contracted in writing with Bluto that all general maintenance and extraordinary repairs required for Popeye's buses would be performed by Bluto, who owned and operated "Bluto's Bus and Truck Center." A schedule of fees for most standard repairs was included in the contract. It happened that Popeye's wife, Olive, owned and operated a small advertising agency. Popeye wanted Olive's business to succeed, and so he included a clause in his agreement with Bluto that Bluto would place all his ads for his repair shop through Olive's agency during the oneyear term of the agreement.

9. Assume for purposes of this question only that for six months Bluto dutifully placed all his ads through Olive's agency and informed her of his agreement with Popeye. During that time, Olive turned down work from two prospective clients because of the time that she would have to devote to designing and disseminating ads from Bluto. Bluto then discovered that Popeye was having some of his buses repaired and maintained by other shops. Bluto immediately ceased placing ads through Olive and employed another agency. Can Olive successfully bring suit against Bluto to enforce the agreement?
(A) Yes, because she partially performed by placing ads for Bluto during the first six months of the agreement.
(B) Yes, because she detrimentally relied on Bluto's promise to place ads when she refused other clients.
(C) No, because Olive provided no con- sideration for the agreement between Popeye and Bluto.
(D) No, because Popeye's exclusive use of Bluto's repair shop was a condition for Bluto's duty to purchase ads through Olive, and Popeye's actions excused Bluto's duty to Olive.

GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE 

\section{CONTRACTS}

10. Assume for purposes of this question only that Popeye dutifully sent all his buses to Bluto for repair and maintenance. However, six months into the agreement, Popeye divorced Olive. Although Bluto had been placing all his ads through Olive, Popeye told Bluto, "You don't have to place ads with Olive anymore." Bluto promptly began placing ads through another agency. Olive then learned of the agreement between Popeye and Bluto. Popeye continued to send all his buses to Bluto. Can Olive enforce the agreement in her favor?
(A) Yes, because she was an intended beneficiary of the agreement between Popeye and Bluto.
(B) Yes, because Olive had an enforceable contract with Bluto concerning the advertising.
(C) No, because Popeye and Bluto had a right to modify their agreement without Olive's permission.
(D) No, because Olive was a gratuitous beneficiary whose rights depended on her status as Popeye's wife.

Questions 11-12 are based on the following fact situation:

Alice entered into a written agreement with Moran, whereby Moran agreed to remodel the basement of Alice's home, and Alice agreed to pay Moran $\$ 8,000$ upon completion of the job. The agreement contained a list of specifications as to the types of materials to be used in the remodeling. Among these specifications was a provision that Moran was to use an imported Brazilian hardwood for the paneling. Moran began the job, and then assigned his right to payment under the agreement to Nicholls. When the job was a little more than half completed, Alice sold the house to Bill. In a document separate from the deed of conveyance, Alice assigned her right to Moran's labor and delegated her duty to pay under the contract to Bill. 11. Assume for purposes of this question only that Moran completed the job on time but used Wyoming knotty pine instead of Brazilian hardwood for the paneling. The knotty pine is considered to be inferior to the Brazilian hardwood and is much less expensive, and Bill was very displeased when he saw the result. Who can Bill sue for breach?
(A) Alice only.
(B) Moran only.
(C) Moran and Nicholls.
(D) Alice, Moran, and Nicholls.

12. Assume for purposes of this question only that Moran completed the job on time but used Argentinian hardwood instead of Brazilian hardwood. The Argentinian hardwood is virtually identical in appearance and is considered equivalent in value to the Brazilian hardwood, and they are often used interchangeably in the construction industry. Upon learning of the substitution, Bill refused to pay Nicholls. If Nicholls files suit against Alice for payment, will the court find Alice liable to pay Nicholls?
(A) Yes, unless there was a nonassignment clause in the contract between Alice and Moran.
(B) Yes, but only as a surety for Bill.
(C) No, because Alice delegated her duty to pay to Bill and Alice is no longer liable on the contract.
(D) No, because the remodeling work was not performed according to specifica- tions. 

\section{Question 13}

With the busy summer beach season fast approaching, Trendee of Bayonne, a retail women's wear store, ordered 100 women's swimsuits at $\$ 10$ each, as advertised in the catalog of Stingray, a manufacturer of swimwear. Stingray shipped Trendee 40 swimsuits, along with a letter, stating in relevant part: "We have shipped you 40 swimsuits at $\$ 10$ each as per your recent order. Please remit $\$ 400$ to Stingray. Be informed that we will be unable to ship the additional 60 suits you requested at this time or at any time during this year's beach season." Trendee took the 40 suits, put them on their salesracks, and began to sell them. Trendee immediately sought an alternate supplier of swimsuits. The best price it could obtain was $\$ 11$ per suit from Flying Fish Industries. Trendee ordered, received, accepted, and paid for 60 suits at $\$ 11$ each from Flying Fish. Trendee has refused to pay Stingray.

If Stingray sues Trendee, Stingray is entitled to:

(A) $\$ 400$, the contract price for the 40 suits delivered by Stingray and accepted by Trendee.

(B) \$340, the contract price for the 40 suits, less Trendee's cover damages.

(C) The fair market value of the 40 suits, less the $\$ 60$ cover damages.

(D) Nothing, because it failed to fully perform the contract.

\section{Question 14}

Via a circular, WidgeCo, a manufacturer of widgets, sent an offer to Distrucorp, a major wholesaler. WidgeCo offered a standard lot (quantity well-known in the widget trade) of widgets for $\$ 8,000$. This was a good price, and the president of Distrucorp personally mailed back to WidgeCo Distrucorp's standard printed acceptance form. However, the president wrote "in large letters in his own hand on the form, "Our liability on this contract is limited to $\$ 200$." Two days later, the WidgeCo sales manager received the communication from Distrucorp. A week later, WidgeCo had sent no additional communication to Distrucorp.

Assuming no additional facts, what is the relationship between the parties?

(A) There is no contract between WidgeCo and Distrucorp, because Distrucorp made a material alteration.

(B) There is a valid, enforceable contract between WidgeCo and Distrucorp, but it is limited to the terms of WidgeCo's offer.

(C) There is a valid, enforceable contract between WidgeCo and Distrucorp, and it contains the additional term because WidgeCo raised no objection.

(D) Distrucorp has sent a valid counteroffer to WidgeCo, which WidgeCo can accept or reject.

\section{Question 15}

Tekmart, a leading computer supply retailer, contacted Megabyte, a manufacturer of blank diskettes, on October 25 to supplement the supply of diskettes at Tekmart's area stores. In response, Megabyte offered to supply 50 cartons of boxed diskettes at $\$ 200$ a carton, for a total price of $\$ 10,000$, delivery one week after acceptance, and sent a letter containing those contractual terms to Tekmart on October 26 . The president of Tekmart signed the letter on October 27 without making any changes to it and sent it back to Megabyte by first class mail. The next day, having not heard from Tekmart, Megabyte's sales manager contacted the president of Tekmart and informed him that, if Tekmart accepted by the end of the month, it would receive a $1 \%$ discount in the total price. When Tekmart's president responded that he had already sent the acceptance, the sales manager assured him that the discount would still apply. On October 31, Tekmart received a circular from Dataco offering comparable diskettes for $5 \%$ less than Megabyte's price. The president of Tekmart immediately faxed a rejection to Megabyte. Megabyte received the rejection immediately but took no action on it. The next day, November 1, Megabyte received the signed contract from Tekmart. What is the status of the agreement between the parties?

(A) An enforceable contract was formed for $\$ 9,900$ because Tekmart accepted before October 31 and needed no additional consideration for the oral modification.

(B) An enforceable contract was formed for $\$ 10,000$ because the parol evidence rule precludes Tekmart from offering evidence of the telephone conversation.

(C) An enforceable contract was formed for $\$ 10,000$ because, even though Tekmart accepted before October 31 , the Statute of Frauds makes the oral modification between the parties unenforceable.

(D) An enforceable contract was not formed between the parties because Tekmart's rejection was received before its acceptance. 

\section{Question 16}

Tommy was in his third year of college, and Tommy's father, Dad, often sent Tommy money to help Tommy pay for books and for living expenses. During the last winter break, Tommy brought his girlfriend Gidget home to meet his family. Dad took an instant dislike to Gidget, and has continually lectured Tommy about her, insisting that Tommy could find someone "more refined" to date.

In early March, Tommy telephoned Dad from College Village, where the university was located. Tommy asked Dad for $\$ 1,000$. Dad told Tommy, "I'll send you the thousand bucks, but if you don't find a classier girlfriend than that Gidget person, this is the last subsidy you'll get from me, young man." Tommy thanked Dad, and promptly went to a jeweler with Gidget, where Tommy and Gidget selected an engagement ring priced at $\$ 5,000$. Tommy, who was 21 years of age, signed a contract to purchase the ring. The contract required Tommy to make a \$1,000 down payment and then to make a series of installment payments. Tommy planned to use the $\$ 1,000$ check he was expecting from Dad for the down payment. Tommy and Gidget both worked at part-time, minimum wage jobs while they attended school. Through a friend who lived in College Village, Dad discovered Tommy's plan to buy Gidget an expensive engagement ring. Dad refused to send Tommy the $\$ 1,000$ check. The jeweler is now demanding that Tommy make the $\$ 1,000$ down payment on the ring and pay the first installment as well. Can Tommy legally enforce Dad's promise to send Tommy $\$ 1,000$ ?
(A) Yes, because Tommy relied on Dad's promise and the doctrine of promissory estoppel applies.
(B) Yes, because Tommy was an intended beneficiary.
(C) No, because Dad's promise was a gift unsupported by consideration.
(D) No, because Dad did not promise to send the money with the expectation of inducing Tommy to buy an engagement ring for Gidget.

\section{Question 17}

Ellen owns a high-style ladies' fashion store in Beverly Hills. Calvin is the designer and manufacturer of a world-famous line of original gowns.

On April 1, Ellen and Calvin signed a written agreement wherein Ellen was appointed the "sole and exclusive" retail distributor for Calvin's clothes in Beverly Hills. The contract provided that Calvin was to have the absolute right to cease doing business with Ellen "at any time and for any reasons Calvin chooses."

On May 1, Ellen handed Calvin a written order for $\$ 50,000$ worth of his original gowns, to be delivered to Ellen on September 1. Calvin did not sign an acknowledgment of Ellen's order, but in her presence he set aside the originals designated in her order by putting her name on them.

To publicize her new line of merchandise, Ellen conducted a large advertising campaign announcing to the Beverly Hills public that she would have a wide selection of Calvin's originals on display on September 1. She also made substantial improvements to the store to display these clothes in lush and expensive settings.

On August 15 , Calvin wired Ellen, "Sorry, darling, I have to invoke my right to terminate our arrangement. Your competitor in Beverly Hills, Shannon, has made an offer for the clothes you ordered that I simply couldn't pass up. I know you'll understand. Best wishes, Calvin."

Upon receipt of the message, Ellen filed suit against Calvin. Calvin defends on the ground that his April 1 agreement with Ellen is unenforceable for lack of consideration because Ellen did not obligate herself under the contract in any way. How should the court rule on that issue?
(A) Any want of consideration at the formation stage was cured by Ellen's actual tender of a large order.
(B) The April agreement was, in effect, a "firm offer" between merchants and hence binding on both parties even though there was no consideration.
(C) There was sufficient consideration in Ellen's implied promise to exercise her best efforts to promote the sale of Calvin's gowns.
(D) Calvin set aside the gowns in Ellen's presence, and thereby apparently expressed his willingness to ship as per her order.

\section{Question 1}

Dorothy's very best friend was Melissa, and Dorothy shared all of her secrets with her. Dorothy and her husband, Hank, often brought Melissa, a divorcee, along on vacations and dining engagements. One day, however, after being tipped off by a mutual friend, Dorothy went through Hank's drawer and discovered steamy love letters to him from Melissa. The tone of the letters made it obvious that Hank and Melissa had been having an affair for at least three years. Dorothy became furious, but kept repeating to herself, "Don't get mad, get even!" She purchased a handgun and waited for the right moment to use it. The moment occurred at a large outdoor barbecue celebrating Melissa's birthday. At the barbecue, Dorothy gave the gun to Melissa's 10-year-old nephew, Sammy. She told Sammy, "Why don't you go up and point this gun at your Auntie Melissa. When you pull the trigger a sign will come out saying, 'BANG! and Happy Birthday,' just like in the circus." Sammy took the gun, pointed it at Melissa, and pulled the trigger. However, Sammy's aim was faulty, and when the gun discharged the bullet struck Hank, killing him. The police quickly linked Dorothy to the crime.

Which of the following best describes the crime or crimes of which Dorothy can be properly convicted?

(A) Murder of Hank and attempted murder of Melissa.

(B) Murder of Hank, but not attempted murder of Melissa.

(C) Attempted murder of Melissa, but not murder of Hank.

(D) Attempted murder of Melissa or murder of Hank, but not both.

\section{Question 2}

Howard was supposed to be out of town on a three-day business trip. Because he completed his business more quickly than expected, he flew home on Wednesday night instead of Thursday afternoon. Howard arrived home and let himself into the house. He heard noises from the bedroom and, upon investigation, Howard was shocked to find his wife, Chastity, in bed with Nick, a good friend of Howard, who lived four blocks away. Nick dressed quickly and took off out the back door. Howard screamed a number of epithets at Chastity and then told her, "Nick's going to pay for this! Get me a drink! It will give me the steadiness to do what I have to do to avenge my honor." A frightened Chastity brought Howard a bourbon and water. Howard drank it quickly and demanded yet another drink. After consuming several more drinks, Howard unlocked the closet, pulled out a rifle, and loaded it. He then set off for Nick's house.

Howard arrived at Nick's about 10 minutes later. Nick had neglected to lock his front door, so Howard walked in. He found a trembling Nick in the living room, and Howard pointed the gun at him. Nick immediately began apologizing, blaming the affair on Chastity, and pleading for his life. Howard stood silently listening to Nick, but he kept the gun trained on his erstwhile friend. Suddenly, Nick pulled a switchblade knife from his pocket. As the metal flashed, Howard fired a single shot at Nick. The bullet struck him in the middle of the forehead and Nick died instantly. Howard set the gun down, fell to his knees, and began crying. A neighbor who heard the shot reported it to the police. They arrived a few minutes later and found a distraught Howard muttering about losing a friend and a marriage in one night.

Howard can be convicted of:
(A) Murder.
(B) Manslaughter, because Howard was still distraught over finding Nick in bed with Chastity.
(C) Manslaughter, because his intoxication prevented Howard from having the requi- site intent for murder.
(D) No homicide crime, because Nick was about to attack him with a knife.

\section{Question 3}

Larry was passing by a house under construction when he noticed that the ladder being used by workers on the roof had copper braces supporting the rungs. After making sure that the workers on the roof could not see him, Larry used a pliers that he had in his pocket to remove all of the copper braces that he could reach from the ground. A short time later, Vernon climbed down the ladder and it collapsed. He fell to the ground and severely injured his back. Larry was apprehended a few hours later trying to sell the copper for scrap.

A statute in the jurisdiction makes it a felony for "maliciously causing serious physical injury to another." Larry was charged with malicious injury under the statute and was also charged with larceny. After a jury trial in which the above facts were presented, he was convicted of both charges.

If Larry appeals the conviction for the malicious injury charge on grounds of insufficient evidence, how should the court rule?

(A) Affirm the conviction, because Larry was engaged in criminal conduct at the time of the act that resulted in the injury.

(B) Affirm the conviction, because the jury could have found that Larry acted with malice.

(C) Reverse the conviction, because there was no evidence that Larry intended to injure anyone.

(D) Reverse the conviction, because there was no evidence that Larry bore any malice towards Vernon or the other workers on the roof.

\section{Question 4}

Victor was desperately ill with a particularly virulent and painful form of cancer. He was permanently hospitalized and quite helpless as the killer disease tore at his vitals. Victor's daughter, Dana, was devoted to her dad. She visited him every evening in the hospital and spent many hours with him on the weekends. For over two months, Victor pleaded with Dana, "Please kill me and put me out of my misery. I'm in such terrible pain. The pangs of Hell couldn't be any worse than this!" Every day or evening that Dana visited, Victor would renew his plea to be killed. The staff doctors and nurses had often heard Victor's plaint. One Saturday afternoon, Dana paid her usual visit to Victor. His pleading was as heartrending as ever. With a tender expression on her face, Dana pulled a small revolver from her purse. She fired a shot at Victor, killing him instantly. Dana immediately broke into tears and repeatedly kissed the face of her dead father. Hospital authorities called the police, and Dana was charged with Victor's death.

What is the most serious offense of which Dana can be convicted?

(A) First degree murder, defined by the jurisdiction as premeditated and deliberate killing of another human being.

(B) Second degree murder, defined as any murder not classified as first degree murder.

(C) Voluntary manslaughter.

(D) No crime. 

\section{Question 5}

Andt lent his swim fins to his friend Gracehoper. Gracehoper promised to return the fins in a week, but two months had passed and, despite many reminders, Gracehoper still failed to return the fins. Andt decided to go to Gracehoper's cabin to retrieve them. Andt went to the cabin and knocked on the door, hoping to find Gracehoper at home. After knocking several times with no response, Andt tried the door and found it to be unlocked. Andt decided to look for the swim fins in Gracehoper's cabin and to retrieve them. Andt opened the door and entered Gracehoper's cabin. He looked around the cabin for $20 \mathrm{~min}$ utes, but he could not locate the swim fins. He concluded that Gracehoper was probably using them and left the cabin, taking nothing from it and closing the door behind him.

If Andt is later charged and tried for burglary, Andt's best defense to the charge is which of the following?
(A) Andt left the cabin without doing anything.
(B) Andt took nothing from the cabin.
(C) The swim fins belonged to Andt.
(D) Gracehoper's door was unlocked.

Questions 6-7 are based on the following fact situation:

Kuegler, who had a long list of petty crimes to his credit, cased the Jaymart Department Store for a week. He noticed that a display case containing very expensive watches was near one of the store's exit doors. He planned to steal the watches by setting a diversionary fire in a trash basket, hoping that this would distract the store security personnel long enough for Kuegler to break the glass covering the watch case, grab the watches, and run out the nearby exit. Kuegler knew that the store had an automatic sprinkler system that would promptly douse the fire, but his purpose was merely to create a distraction rather than to cause any damage to the building. One afternoon at 2:30 p.m., Kuegler entered the Jaymart. He advanced to a trash barrel and poured some lighter fluid onto the trash. He threw the lighter fluid can into the barrel and tossed in a match after it. The lighter fluid immediately caused a long flame to rise. The flame quickly charred the wall next to the barrel and blistered the paint on the surrounding area. No serious damage was done to the structure, because the sprinklers operated as designed and quickly put out the fire before it could spread. Kuegler made a dash toward the case containing the watches, but just as he was breaking the glass case, one of the store's security guards apprehended Kuegler and called the police. Kuegler was read his Miranda rights and taken into police custody. A statute in the jurisdiction extends the crime of arson to buildings other than dwellings.

6. If Kuegler is tried for the crime of arson, the court should find him:
(A) Not guilty, because Kuegler did not intend to burn the building.
(B) Not guilty, because Kuegler's act was sufficient only for attempted arson.
(C) Guilty, because Kuegler's conduct demonstrated the requisite state of mind for the crime.
(D) Guilty, because Kuegler started the fire during the act of perpetrating another felony.

7. Which of the following best describes the crimes, if any, of which Kuegler could be properly convicted?
(A) Larceny only.
(B) Larceny and attempted arson.
(C) Attempted larceny and arson.
(D) None of the above. 42. CRIMINAL LAW

\section{Question 8}

In which of the following situations is the defendant least likely to be found guilty of an attempted crime?

(A) In order to track down "fences" and other distributors of stolen goods, police officers, with permission of the owners and insurers, forward stolen jewelry they have intercepted on the way to Don, a reputed fence. Don takes the jewelry, which he believes to be stolen. Don is arrested and charged with attempted receipt of stolen goods.

(B) Dewey, a 21-year-old male, believes the "age of consent" in the state to be 18 , and that sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 18 constitutes statutory rape. In fact, the statute applies only to females under the age of 16 . Dewey's girlfriend, Irma, is 17 years of age. With Irma's consent, Dewey engages in sexual intercourse with Irma. Later, Dewey brags in a bar, "I just made it with some jailbait." Dewey is arrested and charged with attempted statutory rape.

(C) Doreen, a community activist, is outraged that a bill to place greater restrictions on picketing is being debated in the state legislature. Doreen asks her lawyer, Lax, if she can conduct a demonstration in the state capitol building, where the legislature sits. Lax assures her that the United States Supreme Court has recently upheld a very similar case and tells Doreen she should act freely "because the First Amendment protects you." In fact, Lax did not read the case carefully. The Court allowed demonstrations on the capitol grounds, but not in the building itself. As Doreen carries her picket sign into the state capitol building, she is arrested by security guards and is charged by state police with attempting to conduct an illegal demonstration. (D) Hartigan, a police officer, disguises himself as an elderly homeowner as part of a police "sting" operation aimed at unscrupulous home repair operations. Drew, president and sole proprietor of Drew's Home Repairs, inspects the home that he believes belongs to Hartigan. Drew believes Hartigan is the homeowner and a senior citizen with failing mental powers. Drew's inspection of the home reveals the only plumbing problem to be a 25 -cent washer that needs replacing. Drew tells Hartigan that the plumbing in the house is in terrible shape, and that city building inspectors are likely to condemn the home if plumbing repairs are not made immediately. Drew offers Hartigan a contract to perform all required plumbing repairs for $\$ 10,000$. Drew emphasizes that this is a "rock bottom price with a $20 \%$ senior citizen discount." Drew is arrested and charged with attempted theft by false pretenses. Questions 9-10 are based on the following fact situation:

Jeffries was the chief of security for The Watervliet, a large, exclusive apartment complex. Most of The Watervliet's residents were quite wealthy, and Jeffries resented the fact that he had many responsibilities and received what he considered to be a paltry salary. Therefore, Jeffries was receptive when Garth told him that he would pay Jeffries $\$ 250$ if Jeffries would obtain a key to the apartment of Mrs. Wealthy and give the key to Garth. Mrs. Wealthy was an affluent and socially prominent widow who resided in The Watervliet. The next day Jeffries obtained a key to Mrs. Wealthy's apartment and gave the key to Garth. Garth handed Jeffries the $\$ 250$ in cash. Jeffries believed that Garth planned to use the key to take valuables from Mrs. Wealthy's apartment. In fact, Garth planned to pretend that he was a "Good Samaritan" returning a "lost key" to Mrs. Wealthy that Garth had fortuitously found in The Watervliet lobby. Garth felt that this ploy would gain him access to Mrs. Wealthy's apartment, where he planned to sell her a "real estate limited partnership share" in nonexistent Florida property.

Garth's plan worked up to a point. He brought the key to Mrs. Wealthy, who thanked him and invited him into her apartment for afternoon tea and watercress sandwiches. Garth attempted to sell the "limited partnership share" to Mrs. Wealthy, but she quickly surmised that the limited partnership was bogus and politely asked Garth to leave. Garth, a resourceful chap, did not want his $\$ 250$ investment in the key to be a total waste of money, so he surreptitiously removed a small but valuable art deco bronze statuette from Mrs. Wealthy's foyer and left the apartment with it. 9. If Jeffries is arrested and appropriately charged with theft of the key and conspiracy to commit theft of the key, of what additional crime or crimes, if any, could Jeffries be charged and convicted?
(A) Attempted false pretenses.
(B) Conspiracy to commit burglary.
(C) Larceny, conspiracy to commit bur- glary, and conspiracy to commit false pretenses.
(D) None of the above.

10. If Garth is arrested and appropriately charged with conspiracy to commit theft of the key and attempted false pretenses, of what additional common law crime or crimes could Garth be charged and convicted?
(A) Larceny.
(B) Burglary.
(C) Larceny and burglary.
(D) Larceny and conspiracy to commit burglary.

\section{Question 11}

Bulky was six foot four and weighed 280 pounds. One afternoon Bulky was wandering rather aimlessly and became lost in an unfamiliar part of the city. He reached into his pocket and discovered he only had 35 cents. He wanted to take a bus back to the city center, but bus fare was $\$ 1$ per ride. Bulky was rather scruffily dressed and he had not had a haircut in several months. He approached Juan, a slightly built man who was standing alone at the bus stop. In a gruff voice, Bulky asked Juan, "Do you have any money?" When Juan replied, "Yes,"'Bulky said, "Give me five dollars!" Juan reached into his pocket and handed Bulky a five-dollar bill. Juan walked away from the bus and flagged down a passing patrol car. Juan told the police, "I've been robbed," and pointed out Bulky, who was still standing at the bus stop. Bulky was arrested and charged with robbery.

At Bulky's trial, Bulky took the stand in his own defense. Bulky testified, "I wasn't trying to rob anybody. I was just trying to beg some money to get myself back home."

If the jury believes Bulky's testimony, Bulky should be found:
(A) Not guilty of robbery, because Bulky lacked the requisite criminal intent.
(B) Guilty of robbery, because Bulky took Juan's money after intimidating him, and the effect of Bulky's size on Juan, rather than Bulky's intent, is controlling.
(C) Not guilty of robbery, but guilty of assault, because Bulky placed Juan in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm.
(D) Guilty of both robbery and assault, because assault is not a lesser included offense of robbery.

\section{Question 12}

Alert police officers noticed that a late-model "Belchfire 500" automobile was being driven at an excessive rate of speed. The car, driven by Doofus, was pulled over to the curb. As Officer Smith issued a speeding citation to Doofus, her partner, Jones, fed the license plate numbers into the police computer. It turned out that the Belchfire had been very recently reported as stolen. Doofus was unable to produce satisfactory registration papers and was arrested for car theft. At the police station, Smith gave Doofus the standard Miranda warnings, and Doofus agreed to answer Smith's questions regarding a local "chop-shop" network, which arranged for the theft of expensive automobiles so that they could be cut up for parts. After a while, Jones suggested, "Let's break for lunch." He and Smith escorted Doofus to a nearby cafeteria. During the course of their lunch, which lasted about an hour, Smith noticed that Doofus, who was otherwise rather shabbily dressed, was wearing an obviously expensive "Xelor" watch. Upon their return to the station, and without giving any new Miranda warnings, Smith resumed interrogation of Doofus. She asked Doofus about a recent home invasion in the swank "Notting Hill" neighborhood, where a quantity of valuable jewelry, including a "Xelor" watch, was taken. Doofus thereupon confessed to the home invasion, and was indicted on the home invasion charge, a felony under the jurisdiction's modern criminal code.

If Doofus files an appropriate motion to prevent the confession from being admitted at his trial, Doofus will probably:
(A) Succeed, because the police did not repeat the Miranda warnings before questioning Doofus about another crime.
(B) Succeed, because the police acted in a custodial setting.
(C) Fail, because Doofus was not in custody on a home invasion charge.
(D) Fail, because the original Miranda warn- ings given Doofus were sufficient under the circumstances. 

\section{Question 13}

Denise, a 12-year-old girl, entered a grocery store. When she believed that no one was looking, she grabbed two packages of "Blinkies," a popular confectionery item, and concealed them under her coat. As she attempted to leave the store, Gordon, a security guard employed by the store, grabbed Denise by the arm. He told her, "You're too young to be a thief!"' Denise began crying and blurted out, "I lost my lunch money on the way to school and I was really hungry!"

If Denise is charged with shoplifting, what is the State's best argument that Denise's Miranda rights have not been violated by Gordon?

(A) Gordon's statement was not interrogatory.

(B) It is discretionary whether to give juveniles Miranda warnings.

(C) Denise has not yet been arrested and formally charged with any crime.

(D) Gordon was not a government agent.

Questions 14-15 are based on the following fact situation:

Soar Airlines Flight 226 was a flight from Miami to Washington, D.C., with an hour stopover in Orlando. At the Orlando Airport, Mike and Nick, holding tickets to Washington, D.C., disembarked from the plane. Each carried a rather large piece of carry-on baggage. Mike went into a telephone booth and placed a call, while Nick stood with his back to the booth, looking around in all available directions. Sam, an officer of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration assigned to watch for drug activities at the Orlando Airport, noticed Mike and Nick. As soon as Mike emerged from the phone booth, Sam approached the two men. Sam identified himself and asked Mike and Nick, "Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?" Both agreed. After asking about such matters as their destination, Sam asked, "Do you mind if we go into my office and inspect what's in your hand baggage?" Both Mike and Nick agreed. In the office, Sam searched both pieces of luggage and found nothing suspicious in either. He then proceeded to pat down Mike and Nick. He found nothing on Mike, but he felt a bulge around Nick's stomach. Further investigation revealed that Nick was wearing a pouch around his waist which proved to contain cocaine. Mike and Nick were charged with possession of cocaine.

14. At Nick's trial, the prosecution seeks to introduce the cocaine into evidence against Nick. Nick's attorney objects. The court should rule the cocaine:

(A) Admissible, because of the emergency conditions arising from the growing menace of drugs to the public.

(B) Admissible, because, in consenting to the search of his luggage, Nick impliedly consented to a body search.

(C) Inadmissible, because Sam had neither probable cause nor reasonable suspicion to search Nick.

(D) Inadmissible, because Sam had no right to search the luggage.

15. Assume for purposes of this question only that Nick pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine. At Mike's preliminary hearing it has been stipulated that Mike owns the cocaine, but Mike's attorney brings a motion at the hearing to suppress the introduction of the cocaine at trial. How should the court rule on the motion?

(A) In favor, because Mike was not in possession of the cocaine.

(B) In favor, because Mike and Nick had a reasonable expectation of privacy when Sam elected to search them.

(C) Against, because Mike has already stipulated that he owns the cocaine.

(D) Against, because the search of Nick did not violate Mike's reasonable expectation of privacy.

\section{Question 16}

Simpson and two others were indicted on felony charges for electronic theft of bank accounts. Simpson protested that he was innocent and wanted to prove it at trial, but agreed to discuss a plea bargain with the district attorney. The district attorney indicated that he would also charge Simpson with additional theft by computer offenses if Simpson insisted on going to trial, but that if he pleaded guilty to the one charge and agreed to testify against his codefendants at their trial, the prosecution would recommend probation only. Because of the risk of jail time if he was convicted of any of the additional offenses, Simpson agreed.

When Simpson appeared in court, the judge informed him of the nature of the charge and the potential punishment, and that Simpson was waiving his right to trial by pleading guilty. She asked if his plea was voluntary and he replied that it was the best deal that he could get, but that he was really innocent of the crime charged. The judge nevertheless accepted the plea, reserving sentencing until Simpson testified against his co-defendants.

Just before trial of Simpson's co-defendants, they pleaded guilty and provided additional information of Simpson's central role in the crime and in additional computer theft offenses. At Simpson's sentencing, the prosecution introduced the testimony of Simpson's codefendants and asked the judge to impose a jail term. The judge sentenced Simpson to five years in prison for the crime to which he pleaded guilty.

Simpson appeals his sentence, raising the following arguments:

I. The prosecution threatened to bring additional charges when Simpson indicated that he was going to exercise his right to go to trial.

II. The judge accepted Simpson's guilty plea despite his claim of innocence. III. The prosecution did not adhere to the plea bargain after Simpson's co-defendants pleaded guilty.

Which of the above arguments provide a valid basis for vacating Simpson's guilty plea and sentence?
(A) I. and III.
(B) I., II., and III.
(C) II. and III.
(D) III. only. 

\section{Question 17}

Chaven was arrested in the city of Briggs, which is located in the state of Riverfront. He was charged with possession of illegal narcotics and placed on trial in the municipal court of Briggs. Chaven demanded a jury trial, which was duly granted. After the jury had been sworn, selected, and impaneled, Chaven's attorney, Fenway, filed a motion with the presiding judge praying for a dismissal based on a technical error in the bill of information drawn up by the city prosecutor. No witnesses had yet been sworn at the time Fenway filed the motion. The judge ordered an immediate recess while he considered the motion. Two days later he ruled in favor of defendant Chaven and dismissed the charges against him.

A week later a state grand jury indicted Chaven for possession of illegal narcotics with intention to distribute same. The charges arose out of the same incident and arrest described above. Chaven was ordered to appear in the superior court of the state of Riverfront to answer the charges. Fenway immediately filed a motion on Chaven's behalf asserting that it would be unconstitutional to retry Chaven in the state court. The best argument against granting the motion is which of the following?

(A) The city of Briggs and the state of Riverfront are separate sovereigns.

(B) The state charge requires the proving of a fact not required by the municipal charge.

(C) Chaven's trial in municipal court had not yet reached the stage where jeopardy attaches.

(D) The dismissal of the case in municipal court was based on a technicality that did not go to the merits of the case.

\section{Evidence}

\section{Question 1}

Dassent was on trial on a hit and run charge, whereby the prosecution asserts that, while driving his vehicle, Dassent struck and injured Proctor, an elderly pedestrian, and then sped away from the scene of the accident without stopping to assess Proctor's injuries or to render assistance. During the prosecution's presentation of its case, three eyewitnesses testified that the car that struck Proctor had the license plate number DASS 53. A witness from the State Department of Motor Vehicles produced records showing that a vehicle with license number DASS 53 was registered in Dassent's name and that Dassent claimed on his driver's license application that he was born in 1953.

Dassent took the stand in his own defense. He admitted that a car meeting the description of the vehicle given by the eyewitnesses and bearing a license plate with the number DASS 53 belonged to him, but Dassent denied having driven the vehicle on the day that Proctor was injured. Without releasing Dassent as a witness, his lawyer called Father White, an Episcopal priest, to the stand. White is ready to testify that he has known Dassent for 12 years, that Dassent has performed many charitable acts, and that Dassent is a highly responsible person "who would not run away from his obligations by leaving the scene of an accident."

If the prosecution objects to White's proposed testimony, should the court bar White from testifying?

(A) No, because the testimony shows that Dassent is a person of good character.

(B) No, because the testimony is habit evidence tending to show that it was unlikely that Dassent was the perpetrator.

(C) Yes, because one may not use character evidence to bolster one's own testimony.

(D) Yes, because the prosecution has not made an issue of Dassent's character.

\section{Question 2}

Devlin is being tried for murder in the bludgeoning death of Vandross. Devlin denies any involvement in the crime. He calls Westin to the stand. Westin testifies that, in his opinion, Devlin is a nonviolent, peaceable man.

Which of the following, if offered by the prosecution, would most likely be admissible?

(A) A neighbor's testimony that Westin has beaten his wife on several occasions.

(B) A police officer's testimony that Devlin has a general reputation in the community as a violent person.

(C) A neighbor's testimony that Devlin has a reputation for being untruthful.

(D) Evidence that Devlin has a conviction for aggravated battery.

\section{Question 3}

Perry sued Don for bodily injuries suffered by Perry as a result of a collision between the cars they were driving. The accident occurred on a rainy day, when Don's car skidded across the center line and struck Perry's car. A principal issue is whether Don was driving too fast for the wet conditions. At trial, Perry calls Wally to the stand. Wally is prepared to testify that he has lived next door to Don for 15 years, and that Don is notorious in the neighborhood for driving his car at excessive rates of speed. Don's attorney objects.

May Wally's testimony be allowed?
(A) Yes, because Don's character as a careless driver is in issue.
(B) Yes, because character may be proven by reputation evidence.
(C) No, because the testimony is improper character evidence.
(D) No, because the testimony is hearsay, not within any exception. 

\section{EVIDENCE}

\section{Question 4}

On an icy day, a vehicle driven by Doug struck Peter's car in the rear, smashing a taillight and denting Peter's bumper. Before Peter could say anything, Doug rushed out of his car and told Peter, "Look, if you'll take $\$ 500$ for the damage, I'm sure my insurance company will pay for it." Peter refused and sued Doug for damage to his car and minor personal injuries. Peter wishes to testify as to Doug's statement at the time of the accident. Doug objects.

Should the court allow Doug's statement to be admitted?
(A) Yes, because it is an admission of a party- opponent.
(B) Yes, because it is hearsay within the statement against interest exception.
(C) No, because the statement took the form of a settlement negotiation.
(D) No, because the statement is hearsay, not within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.

\section{Question 5}

Doobad was on trial for armed robbery. The defense placed Doobad's friend Wendt on the stand as an alibi witness. Wendt testified that at the time of the armed robbery Doobad was engaged in other activities with Wendt. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Wendt, "Isn't it true, Mr. Wendt, that the grand jury has indicted you for the same crime as Mr. Doobad?" Doobad's lawyer knew that Wendt had been indicted for the armed robbery and was to be tried separately in two weeks, but she vigorously objected to the prosecutor's question.

Her objection should be:
(A) Sustained, because Wendt has been in- dicted, but not convicted, of the armed robbery.
(B) Sustained, because prior bad acts may not be introduced to impeach a witness.

(C) Overruled, because Wendt's indictment tends to show his criminal propensities.

(D) Overruled, because Wendt's indictment tends to show bias on the part of the witness.

\section{Question 6}

Denton was on trial in a civil torts action. He was charged with driving his car negligently and, as a result of his negligence, injuring Potts. Denton's friend, Weiner, was sitting in the passenger seat of the car driven by Denton when the accident occurred. Denton put Weiner on the stand, and Weiner testified that Denton was driving safely and well below the posted 55 mile-per-hour speed limit. Shortly before the trial began, Weiner's secretary, Sarah, telephoned Potts and told him, "You might be interested in knowing that Weiner has been understating his income to the government for years." The Internal Revenue Service has never charged Weiner with tax evasion, but Sarah's information was accurate. On cross-examination, Potts's attorney asked Weiner, "Have you ever cheated on your tax returns?" Denton's attorney objects.

The objection should be:
(A) Sustained, because the question is not relevant to the facts of the case at bar.
(B) Sustained, because witnesses may not be impeached through the use of collateral material.
(C) Overruled, because Weiner's tax evasion shows a tendency to lie.
(D) Overruled, because Weiner's acts constitute a felony punishable by at least one year in prison. 

\section{Question 7}

Dunbad was on trial for the murder of his wife Victa. During the course of the trial, the prosecution sought to introduce evidence that, six months before Victa's death, Dunbad had purchased a large insurance policy on her life, and two weeks prior to her death he purchased two more large policies on Victa's life from separate insurance carriers.

If the defense objects to admission of such evidence, the objection should be:

(A) Sustained, because such evidence would be more prejudicial than probative.

(B) Sustained, because evidence of insurance is inadmissible as a matter of public policy.

(C) Overruled, because the evidence tends to establish motive.

(D) Overruled, because the evidence tends to establish criminal propensity.

\section{Question 8}

Dogwood was put on trial for the robbery and aggravated battery of Birch. Despite having been seriously injured in the attack, Birch took the witness stand and identified Dogwood as his attacker. The first trial ended in a hung jury on both charges, and Birch died shortly thereafter from his injuries. The district attorney then charged Dogwood with felony murder. At the trial on that charge, the prosecution offers into evidence Birch's testimony at the first trial identifying Dogwood as his assailant. Dogwood's attorney immediately objects.

The objection should be:

(A) Sustained, because Birch's testimony was from a prosecution for a different offense than the present trial.

(B) Sustained, because the use of the former testimony of someone who has died violates the defendant's constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him in a criminal case. (C) Overruled, because Birch's testimony is nonhearsay under the Federal Rules as a statement of prior identification.

(D) Overruled, because the requirements of the exception to the hearsay rule for former testimony have been satisfied.

\section{Question 9}

Johnson, a small business owner, filed a treble damages civil antitrust suit against Greed Industries. While Greed's director of marketing, Mimms, was on the stand, Greed's attorney produced a "synopsis of sales," a document generated by Greed's marketing division. Johnson's attorney objected that the record is hearsay. Greed's attorney responded, "Your Honor, this is a business record and, as such, can be admitted into evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule." Johnson's attorney complained, "Your Honor, this so-called 'synopsis of sales' is some selfserving writing concocted for this litigation. The hearsay exception requires that business records be made in the ordinary course of business. I demand a hearing to determine whether this qualifies as a business record."

Which of the following is the most appropriate way for the issue to be decided?

(A) The issue should be decided by the judge after hearing evidence from Greed's attorney and Johnson's attorney outside the presence of the jury.

(B) The issue should be decided by the judge after hearing evidence from Greed's attorney and Johnson's attorney and may be conducted in the presence of the jury.

(C) The issue should be decided by the jury after hearing evidence from both sides.

(D) The issue should be decided by the judge after hearing evidence from both sides outside the presence of the jury, but if the document is admitted by the judge, Johnson may present evidence challenging that finding while presenting his case, and the ultimate decision rests with the jury.

\section{Question 10}

Debra's car struck Peter, a pedestrian, and sped away from the scene of the accident. The car was linked to Debra, but she denies that she was driving the car when Peter was hit and injured. Peter sued Debra for his injuries. The only eyewitness, other than Peter, was Willie, a six-year-old child. During the trial, Peter put Willie on the stand, and Willie testified that he saw Debra driving the car that hit Peter. The defense elected not to cross-examine Willie. The plaintiff's next witness was Schrinkov, a child psychologist. Schrinkov, who had never met Willie before, was prepared to testify that, based on his observations of Willie on the witness stand, it was highly probable that Willie was telling the truth. Schrinkov was qualified as an expert witness with many years of experience dealing with children. However, the defense objected to any questions regarding the veracity of Willie.

Should Schrinkov be allowed to testify about Willie?
(A) Yes, because parties may put witnesses on the stand to reinforce or challenge the veracity of other witnesses.
(B) Yes, because an expert may be needed to explain how children testify in order to avoid confusing the jury.
(C) No, experts may not testify regarding veracity.
(D) No, because Willie's veracity has not yet been questioned.

\section{Question 11}

Plumber, a plumbing contractor, sued Drain, a homeowner. Plumber alleged that Drain refused to pay for extensive pipe repairs performed on Drain's home by Wilson, an employee of Plumber. Plumber called Wilson to the stand as a witness. Wilson, under oath, testified that he did not perform any work at Drain's home. Wilson also denied writing a letter to Lorca telling Lorca that Wilson was going to do plumbing work on Drain's house. Without releasing Wilson as a witness, Plumber offers in evidence the letter written by Wilson to Lorca.

Which of the following is not a proper basis for admitting Wilson's letter?
(A) Testimony by Wilson's wife that she recognizes Wilson's handwriting.
(B) Lorca's testimony that the statements in the letter are responsive to a prior letter from Lorca to Wilson.
(C) Comparison by the jury of the Wilson- Lorca letter with another letter that Wilson has admitted writing.
(D) In-court comparison by Lorca, a nonexpert, of the Wilson-Lorca letter with another letter that Wilson has admitted writing. 

\section{Question 12}

Trent was on trial for the statutory rape of Vanessa. He denied that she was even in his company on the night of the alleged offense, when he was working as the night clerk at a convenience store. The prosecution offers to have Warren testify that, in a phone conversation on the evening in question, Vanessa said, "I have to run; Trent wants me to stop by the store tonight while he's working." The defense objects to the proposed testimony.

Should the court allow Warren's testimony?

(A) Yes, as a present sense impression of Vanessa's.

(B) Yes, as evidence that Vanessa was in Trent's company that night.

(C) No, unless Vanessa is unavailable as a witness.

(D) No, because Vanessa's state of mind is not in issue.

\section{Question 13}

Darryl is being sued under a federal statute that allows an action for damages by victims of domestic violence committed on military bases or other federal land. The lawsuit stems from the alleged longtime physical abuse of Violet, who is the eight-year-old daughter of Darryl's live-in girlfriend.

At trial in federal court, the plaintiff, Violet's legal guardian, calls Phil to the stand. Phil is a physician who treated Violet for her injuries. The plaintiff seeks to have Phil testify that, during his treatment of Violet, he told her that in order to treat her injuries properly, he needed to know how she received her injuries and the length of time that her condition had existed. Phil will testify that Violet told him that Darryl had beaten her, and that the beatings had taken place fairly regularly for several months.

The testimony of Phil is: (A) Admissible only if Violet or her legal guardian has waived the physician-patient privilege.

(B) Admissible as a statement made to a doctor to treat a physical condition.

(C) Inadmissible, because the statement of Violet is not limited to a description of symptoms, but also includes a statement that Darryl caused her injuries.

(D) Inadmissible, unless Violet is too young to testify or is otherwise unavailable.

\section{Question 14}

Julio, a vintner, ordered two large stainless steel tanks from Metalworks, Inc. for use in his wine making business. A month after they were installed, the building in which they were housed burned to the ground. Julio brought suit against Metalworks, Inc., alleging that overheating of the tanks caused the fire. Metalworks's defense is that the fire was caused by Julio's failure to install modern electrical wiring in the rather old building.

At trial, Julio seeks to establish that the tanks overheated by testifying that, two weeks after the tanks were installed, a Metalworks, Inc. employee came to inspect the installation, and Julio said to him, "You know, sometimes these tanks get awful hot."

Should Julio be permitted to so testify?

(A) No, unless there has been no other evidence about overheating of the tanks presented by Julio.

(B) No, because Julio's testimony is inadmissible hearsay.

(C) Yes, because Julio's testimony is evidence of a fact in issue.

(D) Yes, because Julio's testimony is evidence of a verbal act.

\section{Question 15}

After a major merger and corporate reorganization, Gray, who had been an employee of Macho Corporation for 25 years and its public relations director for 10 years, was fired. The excuse given him was that the reorganization and merger required a trimming of personnel to make the corporation "lean and mean." Shortly after Gray's dismissal, Frogman, a member of the board of directors of Macho, who had always liked Gray and admired his competent work, told Gray, "I think what happened to you was rotten, and I want you to know I voted against it, but Cobb, as chairman of the board, took most of the directors with him when he made a point at the reorganization meeting to say, 'Now's our chance to get rid of old Gray, who just doesn't fit our corporate image of youthful vigor."' Gray, who was 60 years old, filed an age discrimination suit against Macho. It was typical practice that all directors' meetings be tape recorded, and that the corporate secretary use the tape recording to type up a formal transcript of the proceedings. The meeting at which Gray's dismissal was discussed was no exception. At the trial of Gray's case, Gray wishes to have Frogman testify as to Cobb's statement at the board meeting.

If the defense objects, the court should rule that such testimony is:
(A) Admissible, because it is based on Frogman's firsthand knowledge.
(B) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.
(C) Inadmissible, because the audiotape of the directors' meeting is the best evidence.
(D) Inadmissible, because the corporate secre- tary's transcription of the directors' meet- ing is the best evidence.

\section{Question 16}

At a products liability trial, one of the most critical issues is whether the temperature was below freezing on January 16. Akiro does drafting work at an architectural and civil engineering firm, but Akiro is also an avid amateur meteorologist. The backyard of Akiro's home is rigged with many weather detection instruments that track wind, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and precipitation. One of Akiro's instruments records temperature by markings from a stylus on a round barograph. Akiro's record of the day in question indicates that it was unseasonably warm and that the temperature never fell lower than 48 degrees Fahrenheit, 16 degrees above the freezing mark. The plaintiff offers into evidence Akiro's barograph record of the temperature on January 16.

The barograph record is:
(A) Admissible, as past recollection recorded.
(B) Admissible, as a record of regularly con- ducted activity.
(C) Inadmissible, unless foundation testimony is given as to the accuracy and good work- ing order of Akiro's instrument on the day in question.
(D) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. 

\section{Question 17}

Don's car struck Phaedra, a pedestrian, at a busy intersection. Bob was a bystander at the scene of the accident. As soon as Phaedra was hit Bob blurted out, "My God, she was crossing on the green light!" Wilma was standing next to Bob at the time. She did not see the accident because she was facing the other direction, but she clearly heard Bob's exclamation.

That night Bob was talking to his friend Walter. He told Walter, "You know that accident I saw this afternoon? The driver didn't run a red light. The light was yellow."

Phaedra sued Don for her injuries. By the time the case came to trial, Bob had died of a heart attack. Phaedra called Wilma to the stand to testify as to Bob's statement that Phaedra was crossing on a green light. Although Don objected, Wilma's testimony was admitted as an excited utterance. Don now wishes to call Walter to the stand to testify as to Bob's statement that Don did not run a red light. Phaedra objects. Should Walter's testimony be admitted?
(A) Yes, but only to challenge the credibility of Bob's earlier inconsistent statement.
(B) Yes, both for impeachment purposes and as substantive evidence.
(C) No, because Bob is not available to explain or deny the statement.
(D) No, because it is hearsay, not within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.

\section{Question 1}

Orville conveyed Redacre "to my best friend, Nelson, and upon Nelson's death to my daughter, Dora." Nelson took up possession of Redacre and lived there for two years. He then conveyed "my interest in Redacre" to his longtime, and much younger, mistress, Magnolia. Although Dora was fond of her father's friend, Nelson, she could not abide Magnolia, and the thought of Magnolia taking over Redacre made Dora sick. Dora tried to get Magnolia to leave Redacre, but Magnolia told Dora, "Redacre is mine until I die, and you'd better get used to that idea." Since Magnolia took up residence on Redacre, she has been sent two county property tax bills, which she has refused to pay. The county is now threatening to bring an action to force a judicial sale of Redacre to cover the tax deficiency. Dora files an appropriate suit asking the court to evict Magnolia from Redacre and to compel her to pay the taxes for her period of occupancy.

The court will rule that:

(A) Magnolia has a life estate in Redacre for the period of her own life, and Magnolia must pay the taxes on the property.

(B) Magnolia has a life estate in Redacre for the period of Nelson's life, and Magnolia must pay the taxes on the property.

(C) Magnolia has a life estate in Redacre for the period of Nelson's life, but Magnolia does not have to pay the taxes on the property, because taxes are the responsibility of the remainder grantee.

(D) Dora owns Redacre, because Nelson could not convey his interest to Magnolia.

\section{Question 2}

Hiram owned a residence on a large parcel of land that included a tennis court and a private golf course. He wanted to be sure that members of his family would continue to enjoy the recreational facilities and have a "family home" at which all the relatives could gather, so he provided in his will that the property would pass upon his death "to Horace, my son, for life, then to my eldest grandchild living at Horace's death, for life, remainder to my great-grandchildren, share and share alike."

When Hiram died, he was survived by his wife, his son Horace, Horace's children Candace and Suzanne, Hiram's daughter Elvira, and Elvira's children Leon and Emily. Candace was the eldest of the grandchildren, followed in age by Leon, Suzanne, and Emily. After Hiram's death, Horace had another child, Chester, and Elvira had two more children, John and Nancy, born in respective order. When Horace died many years later, Candace and Leon had predeceased him, and seven great-grandchildren (of Hiram) had been born.

At Horace's death, in whom is title to the property vested?
(A) Hiram's heirs.
(B) Candace, Suzanne, Leon, and Emily.
(C) Suzanne for life, remainder to the great- grandchildren.
(D) Suzanne for life, remainder to Hiram's heirs.

\section{Question 3}

Powell owned a parcel of land in the mountains near Redwoods National Forest that had been improved by the construction of a permanent campground, consisting of wooden floors and frames for tents, a wooden mess hall with kitchen, and wooden outhouses. Each year he allowed the Boy Scouts to use the parcel, Camp Whachacallit, for their annual summer camp. The rest of the year Powell and his family and friends used the parcel for camping and other recreation.

Powell's will devised the parcel as follows: "Camp Whachacallit to my nephew Ronald, his heirs and assigns, so long as it is used for camping and recreational purposes, otherwise to the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America."

Powell died in 1996. The residuary clause of his will left all his property not devised in the remainder of the will to his daughter Erma, who was also his sole heir. Erma died intestate in 2002 , her only heir being her son Harold.

The jurisdiction's decisional law follows the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, and a statute provides that future estates and interests are alienable, and may be devised or inherited, all in the same manner as possessory estates or interests.

In 2003 , which of the following best describes the interests of Harold and the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America in Camp Whachacallit?

(A) Harold has a possibility of reverter and the Boy Scouts' Council has an executory interest.

(B) Harold has an executory interest and the Boy Scouts' Council has nothing.

(C) Harold has a possibility of reverter and the Boys Scouts' Council has a contingent remainder.

(D) Harold has a possibility of reverter and the Boy Scouts' Council has nothing.

\section{Question 4}

All the land and buildings comprising Miller's Mall, a small shopping center, were owned by Miller, who leased out various stores in the mall. Dwight obtained a two-year lease from Miller on one of the stores. Dwight then opened a gift and greeting card shop which he named "Happy Times Cards and Gifts." Dwight's business was quite successful, and he was making good profits from the store's operation when he underwent a religious conversion and decided that the true meaning of life was not to be found in the quest for material success. Dwight spoke with his friend, Ariel, who was anxious to go into business for herself. Ariel wished to buy Dwight's business and inventory, and Dwight wished to assign his lease on the store in Miller's Mall to Ariel. The lease still had 14 months left to run. Dwight told Miller that he wanted to assign his lease to Ariel, who would run the same kind of business. Miller took out his copy of the lease and pointed out a clause requiring consent to any assignment and providing that any attempted assignment without consent is grounds for terminating the lease. Miller refused to consent to the assignment. Dwight assigned the lease to Ariel anyway; then he went off to meditate under the direction of a famed guru who operated an ashram high in the Himalayas. Ariel operated the card store in the same manner as Dwight, the only difference being a change of the store's name to "Happier Days Cards and Gifts."

Has Miller any recourse against Dwight or Ariel?

(A) Yes, he may evict Ariel and collect damages from Dwight because nonassignment clauses are valid and enforceable.

(B) No, the nonassignment clause is invalid in this case because Miller has a duty to mitigate damages.

(C) No, because Ariel is operating the same type of business as Dwight, and Miller has suffered no damages resulting from the assignment.

(D) No, because nonassignment clauses are invalid restraints upon alienation. 

\section{Question 5}

Dan, an experienced trial lawyer, traveled from his hometown, Secondville, to Capitol City, where he was hired to complete a complex antitrust case that Dan estimated would take weeks, and possibly months, to complete. During his sojourn in Capitol City, which began on a Sunday, Dan stayed at the Capitol City Ryott Hotel. The normal room charges were $\$ 150$ per night. Dan made a deal with the hotel management to pay $\$ 700$ per week for his room for an indefinite period. Dan never told the hotel management exactly how long he planned to stay, but each Sunday he would present the cashier with a check for $\$ 700$, plus any additional taxes and room charges, to pay for the previous week's lodging. Dan was not asked to pay in this manner, but he did it as a matter of custom. Dan did this for four weeks, and then the opposing party suddenly made a generous settlement offer which Dan's client agreed to accept. On a Thursday morning, before checkout time for that day, Dan tendered the hotel cashier a check for $\$ 400$ plus additional charges incurred from Sunday through Wednesday nights. The cashier promptly took the check and then told Dan, "You owe us $\$ 1,000$ plus taxes for 10 more days' lodging. We expect you to pay for the rest of this week as you customarily do, and then for an additional week because you didn't give us a week's notice that you planned to vacate." Dan refused to pay the additional charges. If the hotel sues Dan and the court determines that the parties created a tenancy, for how many additional days' lodging will he be required to pay?
(A) None, because a tenancy at will was cre- ated.
(B) Three days, because a periodic tenancy was created.
(C) Seven days, because a periodic tenancy was created.
(D) Ten days, because a periodic tenancy was created.

The above chart indicates the configuration of three parcels of property located in State Blue, which has a 15-year prescription and adverse possession period. Seventeen years ago, Wallace purchased Woodlot, which is adjacent to Smoothacre and Roughacre. At the time Wallace purchased Woodlot, he asked Arnold, the owner of Smoothacre, if Arnold would grant Wallace an easement to use the paved way across Smoothacre to haul logs to the public road. Arnold was an affable person and he readily granted the easement to Wallace. Wallace paid nothing for the easement, and the deed granting the easement was properly recorded in the office of the county recorder of deeds. For six months Wallace hauled $\operatorname{logs}$ across Smoothacre. However, Wallace decided it would be easier to haul the logs over Roughacre, because the distance to the public road was less using that route. Wallace negotiated with Brenda, the owner of Roughacre, and Brenda granted Wallace a license to haul logs on the gravel road across Roughacre to the public road. Wallace paid Brenda a modest annual fee for this privilege. In the intervening time period, Wallace never used the paved way across Smoothacre for any purpose. Six months ago, Arnold conveyed Smoothacre to Cyd, and two weeks ago, Cyd had a chain-link fence built around the perimeter of Smoothacre which, of course, blocked Wallace's access to the paved way crossing Smoothacre. One week ago, acting within her rights, Brenda revoked Wallace's license to use the gravel road crossing Roughacre. The next day, Wallace told Cyd, "Open up that chainlink fence where Smoothacre abuts Woodlot, because I have an easement to haul my logs across your paved way." Cyd replied, "Forget it, Buster. I never agreed to any easement, and I don't want you hauling logs across my property." Wallace seeks advice about his rights in the easement across Smoothacre.

Which of the following best represents Wallace's rights under the circumstances?

(A) Wallace has no right to use the easement across Smoothacre, because Wallace abandoned the easement.

(B) Wallace may compel Cyd to allow him to use the easement, because nonuse of an easement does not constitute abandonment.

(C) Wallace may use the paved way across Smoothacre, because the revocation of his license to use the gravel road crossing Roughacre means that he has an easement by necessity to cross Smoothacre.

(D) Wallace has no right to use the easement across Smoothacre, because the easement reverted to the owners of Smoothacre by prescription. 

\section{Question 7}

When Uncle Izzy died, his will left Blackacre, a piece of property located in State Black, to his favorite nephew, Seymour, a resident of State White. Seymour never bothered to visit the property. Meanwhile, back in State Black, Michael noticed that Blackacre was now unoccupied. Not one to miss an opportunity, Michael leased Blackacre to Theresa. The lease was in writing and Theresa agreed to pay Michael an annual rent, which she always did promptly. Theresa had been leasing Blackacre from Michael for 15 years, when Seymour took a trip to State Black and decided to take a look at Blackacre. Upon discovering Theresa's occupancy, Seymour filed suit to quiet title, joining Michael in the action. In State Black, the statute of limitations for bringing an ejectment action for trespass to real property is set at 10 years.

Whom shall the court declare to be the owner of Blackacre?

(A) Seymour, because a lease to a third party does not constitute occupancy by Michael.

(B) Seymour, because he was unaware that another was occupying Blackacre.

(C) Michael, because Seymour abandoned Blackacre.

(D) Michael, because occupancy by a tenant is sufficient possession by Michael to invoke adverse possession.

\section{Question 8}

Homer owned Springfield, a valuable piece of property located near the state university. Homer's son, Bart, was a student at the university, and Homer allowed Bart and Bart's classmate, Newt, to live in the large house on the property rent free, in part because he felt that the studious Newt would be a good influence on the partyloving Bart. On Bart's 20th birthday, Homer handed Bart an instrument of conveyance signed by Homer. The deed included the following language: "I give Springfield to my dearly beloved son Bart on the condition precedent that he receive a college degree before he reaches the age of 30 , and if he does not receive the degree by his 30th birthday to my beloved daughter, Lisa." Bart promptly recorded the deed. Shortly thereafter, Bart asked Newt to start paying him rent. An argument evolved out of Bart's request and an angry Bart told Newt to get off his property. Newt refused to leave and Bart filed suit to evict Newt.

How will the court rule?

(A) Bart wins, because he has a fee simple subject to divestment.

(B) Bart loses, because Newt is Homer's tenant and not Bart's.

(C) Newt wins, because Bart is attempting a retaliatory eviction.

(D) Newt loses, because Homer's conveyance cuts off Newt's tenancy.

\section{Question 9}

Owl contracted in writing to sell Birdacre to Partridge and Wren, as joint tenants, for $\$ 60,000$. Partridge and Wren put up $\$ 6,000$ as earnest money. Before the closing date, Owl died. Shortly thereafter, and also before the closing date, a garage on Birdacre burned down. The garage had a fair market value of $\$ 6,500$ and was a complete loss. After the fire Partridge went to see Eagle, the executor of Owl's estate. Partridge demanded that Eagle return the $\$ 6,000$, because Partridge and Wren were no longer interested in Birdacre. Eagle refused and told Partridge that he expected Partridge and Wren to tender the $\$ 54,000$ due on the property when the closing date arrived. Partridge and Wren did not do so. Partridge filed suit demanding a refund of the $\$ 6,000$. Eagle countersued, demanding specific performance by Partridge and Wren or, in the alternative, monetary damages.

How should the court rule?

(A) In favor of Eagle, by requiring specific performance of Partridge and Wren.

(B) In favor of Eagle, by assessing damages against Partridge and Wren.

(C) In favor of Partridge, by ordering Eagle to refund the earnest money.

(D) The court should rule that Eagle is not entitled to either damages or specific performance and that Partridge is not entitled to a refund of the earnest money.

\section{Question 10}

Oiler, an investment banker in Big City, began having cash flow problems. Seeing no other way out, he decided to sell Cattlefork, a distant ranch that had been in his family for generations, to his childhood nemesis, Astro. Not wanting to lose control of the family property forever, Oiler inserted a provision in the deed to Astro binding "Astro, his heirs, and assigns" to offer "Oiler, his heirs, and assigns" the right of first refusal to purchase Cattlefork when it was offered for sale. Astro was not happy with the provision, but Oiler refused to sell the property without the covenant included. Astro reluctantly agreed. Cattlefork was conveyed to Astro, and the deed containing the right of first refusal was duly recorded.

Astro lived on Cattlefork for 23 years. His dislike for Oiler was so great that he did not want Oiler to ever get the property back. Therefore, Astro devised a stratagem to get around the covenant. When informed that Cowboy was interested in buying the property, Astro decided to execute his plan. Astro's friend Ranger agreed to act as a "straw man" to avoid the consequences of the covenant. Astro deeded Cattlefork as a "gift" to Ranger. Ranger recorded the deed, which did not contain the right of first refusal covenant, and Ranger then sold the land to Cowboy for $\$ 200,000$, giving the proceeds of the sale to Astro. Cowboy knew nothing about the right of first refusal because he inspected only Ranger's deed from Astro. When Oiler learned of what had happened, he filed suit to compel conveyance of the land to him. To back up his words, Oiler produced a $\$ 200,000$ letter of credit. The jurisdiction in which the property is located has an unmodified common law Rule Against Perpetuities and the following recording statute:

Any conveyance of an interest in land, other than a lease for less than one year, shall not be valid against any subsequent purchaser for value, without notice, whose conveyance is first recorded.

How will the court most likely rule in this case?

(A) Oiler will prevail, because a deed with the covenant granting the right of first refusal was in Cowboy's chain of title.

(B) Oiler will prevail, because Astro and Ranger acted in bad faith.

(C) Oiler will not prevail, because the covenant is void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.

(D) Oiler will not prevail, because the covenant, although enforceable against Astro personally, does not run with the land. 

\section{Question 11}

Torrens owned Forestacre, a large tract of wooded land, in fee simple. He had always allowed hunters from the local hunting club to use his land during hunting seasons, and had often expressed the wish that they be permitted to continue to use it after he died. On his 75 th birthday, he conveyed Forestacre to his two nephews, Pelt and Dash, who were members of the local hunting club. The deed was a general warranty deed stating that the property was conveyed in fee simple absolute. A few days later, Dash had a serious dispute with Pelt and the other members of the hunting club, and he quit the club. Torrens then executed a written agreement with Pelt stating that the conveyance of Forestacre to Pelt and Dash was in trust for the benefit of the local hunting club for a period of ten years, with Pelt and Dash as trustees, and then to Pelt and Dash in fee simple. Several months later, Torrens died. When the next hunting season drew near, Pelt told Dash that members of the hunting club were once again planning to hunt on the property. Dash would not even consider it, and threatened to have anyone hunting on the property other than Pelt arrested for trespassing. Pelt did not wish to have any further confrontations with Dash, so he brought an action for appropriate legal or equitable relief to establish his rights and the rights of the hunting club.

What, if any, relief should the court provide?

(A) Deny Pelt any relief, because Dash has done nothing that would constitute an ouster of Pelt.

(B) Partition Forestacre into two separate tracts so that Pelt may permit the hunting club to use his half of Forestacre.

(C) Order Dash to permit the hunting club to hunt on Forestacre, because Torrens created an inter vivos trust with the requisite formalities for the benefit of the hunting club.

(D) Order Dash to permit the hunting club to hunt on Forestacre, because Pelt is equally entitled to possession of all of it and can allow members of the hunting club to hunt on the property as his guests.

\section{Question 12}

State Green has a statute providing as follows:

Any judgment properly filed shall, for 10 years from the date of filing, be a lien on the real property then owned or subsequently acquired by any person against whom the judgment is rendered.

Oscar conveyed Birchacre, located in State Green, to Allen, who had had a judgment lien recorded against him two years earlier in the county in which Birchacre was located. One year later, Allen conveyed the property to Brenda by general warranty deed. The deed did not mention the lien, but Brenda was aware of it. Two years later, Brenda conveyed Birchacre to Carla by special warranty deed. Carla was not aware of the lien and her deed also made no mention of it. One year after that transaction, Carla conveyed Birchacre to Dave by general warranty deed. Dave's deed did not mention the lien but Dave was aware of it. The next year, Dave entered into a contract to convey Birchacre to Edgar. Edgar's title search disclosed the judgment lien against Allen, and Edgar refused to proceed with the transaction because title was not marketable. Dave brought an action against Edgar for specific performance and was denied relief. He then brought an action against Allen, Brenda, and Carla for breach of warranty. Assume for purposes of this question that all transactions concerning Birchacre were promptly and properly recorded, and that the party holding the judgment lien has taken no action as of yet to enforce it.

Which parties, if any, will be liable to Dave?

(A) No one, because Dave had actual knowledge of the lien when he purchased Birchacre.

(B) Carla only, because the party holding the judgment lien has taken no action as of yet to enforce it.

(C) Carla and Allen, because Brenda conveyed by special warranty deed.

(D) Brenda and Allen, because they were aware of the judgment lien but did not mention it in their deeds, but not Carla, because she was not aware of the lien. 

\section{Question 13}

Oralee owned Blackacre for many years. After she reached retirement age, Oralee sold the property to Amber, who financed the purchase with a note secured by a 20 -year mortgage with Maritime Bank. Amber promptly recorded her deed, and for 20 years Amber promptly made every payment to the bank. During that period of time, Amber financed the purchase of three automobiles with loans from Maritime Bank, and her record of payment was exemplary. Five years after Amber had paid off the mortgage, she revisited the mortgage loan department of Maritime Bank. She told the loan officer that she wanted to borrow $\$ 30,000$ to help pay for the medical school education of a favorite niece, securing the loan with a mortgage on Blackacre. After confirming Amber's continuing employment status, the bank officer quickly approved the loan based upon Amber's excellent record with the bank. On June 3, Amber executed the note and the mortgage, and the bank gave Amber a certified check for $\$ 30,000$, which she immediately deposited in her account at National Bank. On June 4, Amber sold Blackacre to Brittany for $\$ 150,000$. Brittany, a wealthy actress and film director, paid Amber in cash. Brittany knew nothing about the mortgage. On June 5, Brittany recorded her deed to Blackacre. Two hours after Brittany recorded, Amber closed out her account at National Bank, which included the $\$ 30,000$ from the mortgage. Amber, an only child who had never married, had no "favorite niece." By nightfall, Amber was on a flight to Tahiti with the proceeds of the aforementioned transactions, plus $\$ 2$ million that she had secretly embezzled from her employer.

Brittany did have a favorite niece, an aspiring actress named Christie. On the evening of June 8 , which was a Saturday, Brittany presented Christie with a deed to Blackacre as a gift. At 10 a.m. on June 10, Maritime Bank recorded its mortgage. At 2 p.m. on June 10, Christie recorded her deed. After Amber missed her first mortgage payment on July 1, Maritime Bank employees were sent scurrying to the title office. They discovered the deeds to Brittany and Christie, and the facts surrounding Amber's hasty departure soon surfaced. Maritime Bank demanded that Christie satisfy the $\$ 30,000$ mortgage. Brittany provided Christie with an attorney, who filed an appropriate suit to determine the various interests in Blackacre. The recording statute in the jurisdiction reads, in relevant part:

A conveyance of an estate in land shall not be valid against any subsequent purchaser for value, without notice thereof, unless the conveyance is recorded.

The court should rule that:

(A) Christie owns Blackacre subject to Maritime Bank's mortgage, because Christie is a donee.

(B) Christie owns Blackacre subject to Maritime Bank's mortgage, because Maritime Bank recorded before Christie.

(C) Christie owns Blackacre free of Maritime Bank's mortgage, because Brittany was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice.

(D) Christie owns Blackacre free of Maritime Bank's mortgage, because the bank does not qualify as a bona fide purchaser for value.

\section{Question 14}

Owen owned Copperacre, a large tract of mineral-rich land in a sparsely populated area. He entered into a lease with Yukon, a prospector who was interested in developing the land for mining. The term of the lease was two years and gave Yukon an option to buy the property at any time after the first year. Yukon did not record the lease. Six months later, Yukon left Copperacre for a period of time to prospect in Mexico, leaving no goods on the land that would identify him. Owen then conveyed Copperacre in fee simple to Darlene, who had inspected the property while Yukon was in Mexico and was unaware of the prior transaction. Darlene did not immediately record her deed. After three months in Mexico, Yukon returned to Copperacre and encountered Darlene.

A statute in the jurisdiction provides, in part:

No conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land, other than a lease for less than one year, is valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof whose conveyance is first recorded.

If Darlene brings an action to quiet title to Copperacre, how should the court rule?

(A) Darlene takes title subject to Yukon's leasehold interest and his option to purchase because Yukon acquired his interest first.

(B) Darlene takes title subject to Yukon's leasehold interest but not his option to purchase because he does not yet have the power to exercise the option. (C) Darlene takes title subject to Yukon's leasehold interest and option to purchase regardless of whether she now records, because she will have had notice of Yukon's interest before recording.

(D) Darlene takes title free of Yukon's leasehold interest and option because Yukon failed to record before Darlene purchased the property without notice of his interest.

\section{Question 15}

When Burt purchased Sweetacre, he financed the purchase through a mortgage on the property held by First Bank. The mortgage contained a "due-on-sale clause," requiring the mortgagor to pay off the mortgage at the time the property is sold. Burt made all of his mortgage payments in a timely manner. Five years after Burt purchased Sweetacre, he sold the property to Tully. Burt told Tully that there was a mortgage on the property but he did not mention the due-on-sale clause. Tully paid Burt the asking price for Sweetacre. Burt pocketed the proceeds without paying off the First Bank mortgage.

Which of the following best states the effect of the due-on-sale clause on Tully's interest in Sweetacre?
(A) First Bank can foreclose on Sweetacre.
(B) Tully must agree to assume the First Bank Mortgage on Sweetacre.
(C) The only effect of the clause is that Tully is personally liable on the mortgage.
(D) The clause has no effect, because due-on- sale clauses are generally void as contrary to public policy. 

\section{Question 16}

When Able purchased Blueacre from Oswald, he took out a $\$ 160,000$ mortgage on Blueacre. After being in possession of Blueacre for six months, Able concluded that his cash-flow situation would make it difficult for him to continue to make the high monthly mortgage payments. Therefore, he sold Blueacre to Brett. According to the terms of the agreement signed by the parties, Brett took Blueacre "subject to the mortgage" and agreed to "assume payment of' the mortgage. A recession struck the area, and Brett soon found himself in financial difficulties. Brett sold Blueacre to Carly. Under the terms of the agreement signed by the parties, Carly agreed to take "subject to the mortgage." All deeds and the mortgage were properly recorded. After two months on the land, Carly ceased making mortgage payments. Third National Bank ("TNB"), holder of the mortgage, unsuccessfully demanded payments from Carly, Brett, and Able. TNB properly instituted proceedings to foreclose, and Blueacre was put up for judicial sale. Because the recession had severely depressed property values, Blueacre sold for only $\$ 120,000$. After the $\$ 120,000$ was applied to the mortgage, $\$ 37,800$ was still owing on the principal amount. TNB now seeks judgment to cover the $\$ 37,800$ deficiency. Who can be required to pay the deficiency?
(A) Able only.
(B) Able and Brett.
(C) Brett and Carly.
(D) Able, Brett, and Carly.

\section{Question 17}

Augustus received an "inside tip" from his friend Drusus, a real estate developer. Acting on the tip, Augustus purchased several acres of scrub-covered land of little apparent value. Shortly thereafter, Whizny World, an international conglomerate, announced plans to develop a theme park to be called "Romeland" on a tract immediately adjacent to Augustus's scrubland. The Whizny World plan caused real estate values in the surrounding area to skyrocket.

Augustus could have sold his land for a price many times greater than the purchase price, but Augustus decided that he would use the land to build a variety of tourist-oriented facilities. In order to finance his project, Augustus went to Brutus Bank ("Brubank") and took out a $\$ 20,000$ mortgage on his land. Brubank promptly recorded the mortgage. A few days later, Augustus went to Cassius Bank ("Casbank") and took out a $\$ 15,000$ mortgage on the land. Casbank had known of the Brubank mortgage, and Casbank promptly recorded its own mortgage. A few weeks after that, Augustus reviewed his plans and decided that he needed more money to make his proposed tourist facilities more "upscale." Augustus went back to Brubank and, after full disclosure of the Casbank mortgage, asked the loan officer if he could receive another advance of $\$ 15,000$ from the original Brubank mortgage. The loan officer readily agreed, processed the loan, and increased the amount borrowed against the mortgage from $\$ 20,000$ to $\$ 35,000$. Brubank promptly recorded the change. Augustus quickly spent most of his available funds on retainers for architects, builders, and attorneys. He was shocked to read in the paper that the County Council summarily rejected the Whizny World proposal, acceding to the arguments of community activists and environmentalists that the economic benefits from the theme park would be outweighed by the deleterious effects on the natural beauty and tranquility of the area. Augustus made no more mortgage payments to Casbank, but continued to make payments to Brubank. The value of the land plummeted, and Casbank brought a foreclosure action against Augustus and included Brubank as a party. At the foreclosure sale, the proceeds were a mere $\$ 18,000$ after attorneys' fees and court costs.

How should the proceeds be divided?
(A) $\$ 18,000$ to Brubank and nothing to Casbank.
(B) $\$ 9,000$ to Brubank and $\$ 9,000$ to Casbank.
(C) $\$ 3,000$ to Brubank and $\$ 15,000$ to Casbank.
(D) Nothing to Brubank, $\$ 15,000$ to Casbank, and $\$ 3,000$ to Augustus.

\section{Question 1}

Dietz had recently been released from a mental institution, and was living in a halfway house in Kirbyville. Dietz had a long history of mental illness and had been in and out of institutions since he was an adolescent. Although Dietz would improve for a while, he was subject to recurrent hallucinations and delusions involving a belief that people, animals, and alien beings from another planet were about to attack him. Pansy was peacefully walking along a quiet residential street in Kirbyville. It happened to be the same street as that along which Dietz was walking. Pansy noticed that a person was walking up the street on the sidewalk towards her, but she did not know Dietz. When Dietz saw Pansy approaching him, he pulled a softdrink bottle from his shopping bag and hurled it at Pansy, striking her in the head and causing her injury. Afterwards Pansy filed a civil battery action against Dietz.

Which of the following, if true, provides the best defense for Dietz?

(A) Dietz had no desire to harm Pansy.

(B) Because of his mental illness, Dietz did not understand that his act was wrongful.

(C) Dietz did not know he was striking a person.

(D) Dietz thought Pansy was about to attack him.

\section{Question 2}

Donnalou was the office cut-up and general practical jokester. She decided to pull a prank on Paul, a rather dour and staid co-worker. Knowing where Paul, a creature of habit, always kept his lunch box, she put a small quantity of mescaline, a synthetic hallucinogen, in Paul's thermos bottle of cranberry juice. She expected that strait-laced Paul would have a minor vision or two and act in a goofy and comical manner. However, when Paul drank his mescaline-laced juice at lunchtime he had a severe reaction to the mescaline and experienced wild hallucinations. Donnalou promptly drove Paul to the emergency room of nearby Hacksaw Hospital. Paul was put under observation for a couple of hours. The emergency room physician, Pillpush, was very busy and negligently released Paul prematurely. The next day, while driving, Paul had another powerful hallucination and drove his car into a bridge abutment. Paul suffered contusions, abrasions, a concussion, and several broken bones. After Paul recovered he sued Donnalou for his injuries.

Who will prevail?

(A) Donnalou, because the auto accident would not have occurred but for the negligence of Dr. Pillpush.

(B) Donnalou, because Donnalou did not intend to harm Paul.

(C) Paul, unless the automobile accident could not have reasonably been foreseen.

(D) Paul, because Donnalou intended that Paul should ingest the mescaline.

\section{Question 3}

Steve gave his brother-in-law, Randy, permission to use his boat for a few hours of fishing on the local lake. Randy took the boat out on the lake for a while and then decided to cruise through a system of inland waterways to a larger chain of lakes. The fishing was so good that Randy stayed overnight there and fished most of the next day. On his way back, the boat was struck and seriously damaged by a large tree that fell from the bank without warning. Randy managed to bring the boat back to his house. Just as he got in, Steve called, demanding to know why Randy had not brought it back when he was supposed to. Randy promised that he would bring it back as soon as he could, but Steve replied that he was coming over right now to pick it up. Randy did not want to be around when Steve saw the damage to the boat, so he went out to the store. It was dark when Steve arrived, and he accidently ran over a corner of Randy's garden when he backed his truck up to the boat trailer. When he saw the damage to the boat, however, he left it there and went home.

Assuming that the boat was worth $\$ 18,000$ before it was damaged and sustained $\$ 9,000$ worth of damage, what is the most that Steve will be entitled to recover in an action against Randy?
(A) \$9,000 and damages for loss of use.
(B) $\$ 9,000$ and damages for loss of use, offset by the damage to Randy's garden.
(C) $\$ 18,000$ plus interest.
(D) $\$ 18,000$ plus interest, offset by the damage to Randy's garden.

\section{Question 4}

Mommy's young son, Boy, accidentally swallowed a coin while playing. Boy had to be rushed to the hospital, and although Boy recovered, Mommy has suffered feelings of anxiety, worrying that her child might be injured again. Mommy's husband, Hal, talked Mommy into going to a movie to have a relaxing evening out. She agreed after her mother agreed to watch Boy for the evening. Mommy was enjoying the movie when Hal left his seat to get some popcorn from the concession stand. Hal ordered a large popcorn with extra butter. While handling change, Dizzie, the concession stand attendant, carelessly dropped a quarter into Hal's popcorn. After taking a couple of handfuls for himself, Hal returned to his seat and gave the popcorn box to Mommy. Mommy began to eat the popcorn. However, as she began to munch her third handful of popcorn, she bit the quarter that Dizzie had dropped into the box. Mommy did not swallow the quarter, nor did she bite on it hard enough to injure her teeth or gums, but the feel of the coin brought back all her anxieties about Boy's injury. That night Mommy could not sleep, and the few times that she did nod off for a second, a horrible nightmare recalling her son's injury because of the coin would occur.

If Mommy sues the movie theater for her emotional distress, she will:

(A) Win, because Dizzie was negligent.

(B) Win, because Mommy suffered emotional distress.

(C) Lose, unless a reasonable person would have suffered similar distress after finding a coin in the popcorn and biting on it.

(D) Lose, because Mommy suffered no actionable harm. 

\section{Question 5}

Publectric Company, a utility supplying gas and electricity to West Howard, was working on some of its underground lines. Access to the underground lines was through a utility hole, which Publectric had left uncovered. Publectric installed a modern guardrail around the hole to prevent members of the public from falling into the hole. Although the rail completely surrounded the utility hole, there was an opening in one part of the railing which made it easier to pass down tools to those working below.

Hound, a dog fancier, lived in a single-family home across the street from where the Publectric utility hole was located. Hound owned "Hobson's Hotspur of Trent,"' a champion springer spaniel whom Hound exhibited at dog shows. The dog was also a family pet and was known affectionately to Hound's family as "Hobby." Hound's home had a large front lawn where Hound often walked Hobby without first leashing him. One such afternoon, Hobby saw a squirrel and suddenly bolted away from Hound's lawn. Hobby dashed across the street, passed through the opening of the guardrail, and fell into the utility hole, suffering broken bones and internal injuries. Although expensive and lengthy care by veterinary specialists saved Hobby's life, the dog was no longer of "show quality" after the injuries.

Assume that the jurisdiction in which West Howard is located still recognizes all the common law defenses to tort liability. Can Hound recover his economic losses resulting from the injuries to Hobby in a suit against Publectric?

(A) No, unless Publectric failed to exercise reasonable care in making the dangerous condition safe.

(B) No, if the guardrail used by Publectric meets typical industry standards.

(C) No, because the dog escaped from Hound's yard. (D) No, unless a reasonably careful person would have been injured in the same manner.

\section{Question 6}

Martha brought her nine-year-old son, Norton, along with her on a trip to the Modern Mall shopping center. Modern Mall was, as its name describes, a modern mall development containing many different stores. The mall was entirely enclosed to provide protection from the elements. Martha had spent about half an hour at the mall without purchasing anything. In fact, her main purpose for going to the mall was "window shopping," a pastime that Martha found extremely enjoyable. At that time Norton told Martha that he needed to use the restroom and that he was going to the nearest men's room. Martha agreed to wait for him in front of Lacy's Lingerie Boutique. Norton entered the men's room. He was followed by Barry, a convicted child molester released on parole. Barry cornered Norton in the men's room and sexually molested him. Barry then quickly left the mall and has not yet been apprehended. Martha later filed suit against Modern Mall Management Associates ("MMMA"), the owner of the mall, on Norton's behalf for the injuries suffered by him.

Is MMMA likely to be found liable to Norton?

(A) Yes, because MMMA owes a strict duty to its customers.

(B) Yes, if MMMA had reason to know of the danger to Norton.

(C) No, because a criminal act is a superseding force.

(D) No, because Norton was not an invitee of MMMA.

\section{Question 7}

Penquist was exiting from a parking garage owned and operated by the city of Durham when he discovered that the exit ramp was blocked by construction barricades and a pile of broken-up concrete. No workers or detour signs were around and Penquist was in a hurry, so he backed up and drove down an entrance ramp that was clearly marked as such. As he came around a corner, his car was broadsided by a pickup truck driven by Totten. Penquist was seriously injured in the collision. A statute in the jurisdiction requires drivers to obey all traffic directional markings in both public and private parking lots and garages. The jurisdiction retains traditional contributory negligence rules and retains governmental immunity for municipalities.

If Penquist brings a lawsuit against the city to recover for his injuries, which of the following facts will be least helpful in the city's defense?

(A) Penquist was aware that another exit on the other side of the garage was open.

(B) The construction workers responsible for blocking off the exit ramp were employees of an independent contractor rather than the city.

(C) The city does not collect fees or make a profit in the operation of the garage.

(D) Totten could have avoided Penquist but recognized him as an old enemy and deliberately ran into him.

\section{Question 8}

State Green had a law on its statute books that made any teacher, guardian, therapist, school administrator, or any other person standing in loco parentis subject to the same rights and duties as actual parents. In effect this meant that persons standing in loco parentis could be charged with liability in cases where a parent would have been liable and granted immunity from liability where such would have been the case for a parent. Dr. Zarkov had a Ph.D. in child psychology and was the director of the Verdant Institute, a residential home for disturbed minors located in Verdant City, the largest city in State Green. The Verdant Institute had no fence surrounding its premises, but regular bedchecks were conducted each night to determine that all of the disturbed children were present. A bedcheck determined that Ming, a 12-year-old resident of the Institute, was absent. In fact, Ming had climbed out a window and run away about 15 minutes before the bedcheck. The security guard who conducted the bedcheck immediately reported to Zarkov that Ming was missing. Zarkov did not report Ming's absence to the police or any other authority. Thirty-six hours after Ming ran away from the Institute, Ming savagely beat and severely injured six-year-old Gordon, a child who lived a few blocks away from the Verdant Institute. Although Gordon recovered, physicians indicated that the beating might well cause Gordon to suffer permanent hearing and vision deficiencies. Gordon's parents filed suit against Zarkov on Gordon's behalf.

Which party is likely to prevail in the lawsuit?

(A) Gordon, unless a 12-year-old would not be liable for administering the beating.

(B) Gordon, because Zarkov assumed the role of a parent and liability is, therefore, imposed under the in loco parentis statute.

(C) Zarkov, because he cannot be found vicariously liable for Ming's acts inasmuch as parents are not vicariously liable for the intentional torts of their children.

(D) Zarkov, unless Zarkov had reason to know that Ming had a propensity to commit violent acts. 

\section{Question 9}

After several years in the planning, Jason was ready to begin building his dream house. To save money, he decided to act as the general contractor and hire all of the subcontractors himself. He hired separate contractors for the foundation, the frame, the electricity, the plumbing, and the masonry. After several months of work, the house was finally ready for occupancy. The first night that Jason stayed there, however, a fire swept through the house. Jason managed to escape with a broken ankle and some minor burns, but the house was a total loss. An investigation by the fire marshal established that the fire started from a short in some wiring behind a wall. A small section of wiring that ran to an outlet through a narrow gap between a furnace chimney and a hot water pipe had had part of its outer sheath cut off. Both the chimney and the pipe had been installed, and the walls put up, after the rough wiring had been completed.

Jason filed suit against Shortstop Electrical Service, the contractor that did the rough wiring. The parties stipulated that Shortstop had installed the wiring in compliance with the detailed blueprints that Jason had drawn up, and that the wiring had been inspected and approved by the building inspector shortly after it had been installed. At trial, Jason introduced the report of the fire marshal establishing the above facts and evidence of his medical expenses and other damages. At the end of Jason's case, Shortstop's attorney rested her case and moved for a directed verdict. Jason's attorney also moved for a directed verdict. How should the court rule on the directed verdict motions?

(A) Deny both directed verdict motions, because Jason has presented enough evidence to submit the case to the jury.

(B) Deny Shortstop's motion and grant Jason's motion for a directed verdict, because Shortstop failed to rebut the presumption of negligence that Jason has established.

(C) Deny Jason's motion and grant Shortstop's motion for a directed verdict, because the wire could have been damaged by another contractor.

(D) Deny Shortstop's motion and grant Jason's motion for a directed verdict, because a short in the wiring caused Jason's injuries.

Questions 10-11 are based on the following fact situation:

Paul was admitted to Doctors' Hospital to undergo $\mathrm{x}$-rays and a series of other tests. During the course of the $\mathrm{x}$-rays, Paul was strapped to an $\mathrm{x}$-ray table manufactured by Hospital Suppliers. One feature of the table allowed the table to be tilted into an upright position, so that the patient could be $\mathrm{x}$-rayed while in a vertical position. There was a footrest at the bottom of the table that helped support the patient when the table was in a vertical position. During the course of Paul's $x$-ray procedure, the table was tilted into an upright position. As the technician began to take x-rays of Paul, the footrest fell off the $\mathrm{x}$-ray table. Had Paul been securely strapped in, he would have remained on the table. However, the loss of the footrest caused sufficient additional pressure on the straps that they loosened, and Paul fell from the table onto the floor. Paul's head struck the floor, and delicate brain surgery was required to save Paul's life. Although Paul recovered, he has suffered some permanent disabilities as a result of his fall.

10. If Paul sues Hospital Suppliers on a theory of strict liability for his injuries, who will prevail?

(A) Paul, if the x-ray table was defective.

(B) Paul, if Hospital Suppliers could have installed a safety latch that would have prevented the footrest from falling without incurring unreasonable additional cost or unreasonably impairing the usefulness of the table.

(C) Hospital Suppliers, if a hospital employee was negligent when he strapped Paul in.

(D) Hospital Suppliers, because the table was not in the exclusive control of Hospital Suppliers when Paul incurred his injury. 11. If Paul sues Doctors' Hospital for his injuries:

(A) Paul will win, if a hospital employee failed to use reasonable care in strapping Paul to the table.

(B) Doctors' Hospital will win, unless the defective footrest could have been discovered through reasonable inspection.

(C) Paul will lose, unless he can cite a specific hospital employee as having been negligent.

(D) Doctors' Hospital will lose, unless the injury to Paul was caused by a defect that was present in the x-ray table at its time of purchase. 

\section{Question 12}

Sandra had 30,000 miles on her car when she purchased four new "Huggums" tires from Mac's Tire and Muffler Shop. The "Huggums" tires were manufactured by Kimbo Tire and Rubber Company, a reputable tire manufacturer. It was widely known in the tire industry that purchasers of tires would, on occasion, exceed posted speed limits, and therefore tires were designed to perform at speeds higher than the maximum speed of 65 m.p.h. allowable in most states. Sandra was a safe and careful driver who never exceeded the speed limit.

When Sandra's car had 32,000 miles on it, she sold the car to Pedro. Pedro immediately took the car on a 500-mile trip to visit his sister. During the course of the journey, Pedro often drove his car 10 m.p.h. over the posted limit of 65 m.p.h. As Pedro approached his destination, he was driving 73 m.p.h. on smooth pavement. Suddenly his left front tire blew out for no apparent reason. The car went out of control, crashed into another vehicle, and Pedro was severely injured.

If Pedro sues Mac's for his injuries in a jurisdiction retaining traditional contributory negligence rules, Pedro should:

(A) Recover, because the tire blew out for no apparent reason.

(B) Recover, if the tire was defective when it left Kimbo's manufacturing plant.

(C) Not recover, if Mac's had no reason to know or anticipate that there would be any defects in "Huggums" tires.

(D) Not recover, because Pedro was contributorily negligent in exceeding the speed limit.

\section{Question 13}

Ten years ago Gasmask Chemicals, a leading chemical manufacturer, decided that it needed a safe place to store byproduct waste from its manufacturing processes. Many of these byproducts were highly toxic; thus, Gasmask took great care in selecting a dump site. A highly reputable engineering company was hired and an exhaustive survey was performed. Finally the Temblor Canyon site was selected and the chemicals were stored there underground, using state-of-the-art techniques. Although the survey and attendant geological soundings were performed with consummate skill, the surveyors failed to discover a crack in the rock of the storage area that was too small for their instruments to detect. Over a period of years the chemicals began to seep through the crack and into the water table below the surface. Scientists in nearby Canyon City discovered that the city's water supply, all of which came from local wells that tapped into the water table, contained unacceptably high levels of chemical contaminants. Canyon City was required to spend $\$ 5$ million on a complex filtration system to remove the dangerous chemicals from its water.

Canyon City brought an action against Gasmask to recover the cost of building the filtration system. At the end of plaintiff's case establishing the above facts, Gasmask moved for a directed verdict.

Should the court grant Gasmask's motion?

(A) Yes, because Canyon City has not presented any evidence that Gasmask breached a duty owed to the city.

(B) Yes, if the evidence also established that Canyon City's water wells were drilled after Gasmask stored the chemicals.

(C) No, if the court determines as a matter of law that the chemicals could not be stored without risk of serious harm no matter how much care Gasmask took.

(D) No, because the trier of fact could determine that the chemicals could not be stored without risk of serious harm no matter how much care Gasmask took.

\section{Question 14}

Neither the legislature nor the courts of State Yellow have abolished the common law tort defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. However, the State Yellow legislature decided it was time to take steps against all forms of drug abuse and passed the Omnibus Anti-Drug Act ("OADA"). One of the OADA provisions forbade the selling of airplane glue to anyone under the age of 18 except in small quantities in prepackaged model kits. Violation of the statute was penalized by fines or, in cases of multiple violations, possible imprisonment. OADA also required that all elementary and secondary schools licensed by the state provide comprehensive drug education programs.

Primrose was a 14-year-old resident of State Yellow. Primrose had experienced the drug education program in his school, as mandated by OADA. One of the units in the program covered the dangers of glue sniffing. Primrose understood the anti-drug instruction, but he enjoyed the "high" he got from sniffing glue when he constructed model airplanes, and he wanted to experience more of it. He went to Daffodil's Hobby \& Craft Shop to purchase a large tube of airplane glue. Daffodil, sole proprietor of the hobby shop, sold the large tube of glue to Primrose. Primrose went home, hid in the garage, and sniffed the glue. His parents found Primrose in a coma on the garage floor. Although Primrose will survive, physicians have told his parents that he suffered permanent brain damage from sniffing the glue.

On Primrose's behalf, the parents filed suit against Daffodil, which should result in a verdict: (A) For Daffodil, because Primrose was aware of the danger when he sniffed the glue.

(B) For Daffodil, because Primrose is not a member of the class of persons meant to be protected by OADA.

(C) For Primrose, because Daffodil violated OADA when he sold the glue to Primrose.

(D) For Primrose, unless Primrose could reasonably have been mistaken for an 18 year-old by Daffodil.

Questions,15-16 are based on the following fact situation:

Pluto, Donald, and Mickey were involved in a three-car accident. Pluto was badly injured and suffered $\$ 100,000$ worth of damages. The jurisdiction in which the accident took place has a "pure" comparative negligence statute. Pluto filed suit against Donald for his injuries. The trier of fact determined that Pluto was $30 \%$ at fault, Donald was $30 \%$ at fault, and Mickey was $40 \%$ at fault.

15. Assume for purposes of this question only that the laws of the jurisdiction provide for joint and several liability and that the common law rules regarding contribution have been abolished in favor of a system of contribution based on comparative fault. How much can Pluto collect from Donald?
(A) $\$ 70,000$, but Donald can compel Mickey to pay him $\$ 40,000$ as contri- bution.
(B) $\$ 40,000$, but Donald can compel Mickey to contribute $\$ 10,000$.
(C) $\$ 30,000$, because Donald was $30 \%$ at fault.
(D) Nothing, because Donald was no more at fault than Pluto. 16. Assume for purposes of this question only that joint and several liability has been abolished in the jurisdiction, but that the jurisdiction adheres to the common law rules regarding contribution. How much can Pluto collect from Donald?
(A) $\$ 70,000$, but Donald can compel Mickey to pay him $\$ 35,000$ as contri- bution.
(B) $\$ 40,000$, and Donald cannot compel Mickey to pay him contribution.
(C) $\$ 30,000$, because Donald was $30 \%$ at fault.
(D) Nothing, because Donald was no more at fault than Pluto.

\section{Question 17}

A family planning group submitted a proposal to the Larchville School Board to permit its high school students to have access to contraceptives through the school health clinic. After an article on the proposal in the Larchville Journal, the school board offices were swamped with calls and letters on the issue, most of them against the proposal. It was decided that the school board meeting scheduled for the next week would be held in the high school gymnasium and have an expanded public comment period. At the meeting, which was covered by a reporter from the Journal, Carla was one of numerous parents who spoke out against the proposal. One of the few speakers in favor of the proposal was Charlene, a director of a family planning group from a nearby large city, who described having to drop out of high school when she became pregnant as a teenager. When the Journal article on the school board meeting came out the next day, it identified Carla by her full name but described her as in favor of the proposal because she had to drop out of high school when she became pregnant. This statement was not true and caused great distress to Carla, whose religion considered premarital sex and artificial means of contraception sinful. If Carla brings a defamation action against the Larchville Journal, what will be the probable result?
(A) The Journal will be liable because the statement in the article was false and defamatory.
(B) The Journal will be liable if it was negli- gent as to the statement's truth or falsity.
(C) The Journal will not be liable unless its reporter knew of the statement's falsity or acted with reckless disregard as to the statement's truth or falsity.
(D) The Journal will not be liable because it was reporting on a public proceeding.

\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(B) The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits state dilution of the right to vote by malapportionment of electoral districts. This rule applies to electoral districts for local governmental bodies as well as for the state legislature. When a local government establishes voting districts for the election of representatives, it must establish districts that do not have a significant variance in the number of persons in each district. Here, the Paulopolis districts have twice as many persons as the St. Minny districts, creating an unconstitutional dilution of the Paulopolis citizens' right to vote. (A) is incorrect. The clause in Article IV, Section 4 guaranteeing a "republican form of government" to the states has been judged by the Court to involve a political question. The Court will therefore decline to address that issue. (C) is incorrect because the Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause, which provides that citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states, only prohibits a state from discriminating in favor of its own citizens and against citizens of other states with regard to "fundamental rights," i.e., those involving important commercial activities or civil liberties. Here, out-of-state citizens are not being discriminated against, so the clause is not applicable. (D) is incorrect because the Due Process Clause is usually used to review a law that limits the liberty of all persons to engage in some activity, whereas the Equal Protection Clause is implicated when a law limits the liberty or rights of some persons but not others. The option raising the equal protection argument is therefore the better choice.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(C) Dorit's strongest basis for challenging her denial of benefits by the federal government is the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Dorit's argument is that the regulations for determining who receives benefits create arbitrary and discriminatory classifications among similarly situated groups. Such classifications by a state government can be challenged under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but there is no counterpart to this clause applicable to the federal government. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has held that grossly unreasonable discrimination by the federal government violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and has applied the same standards that it uses in equal protection actions against a state. Hence, this clause constitutes Dorit's only plausible basis for a suit challenging the regulations. (A) is wrong because the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to states and not the federal government, and because it protects only certain privileges and immunities of national citizenship, none of which are implicated in this question. (B) is wrong because, as discussed above, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to the federal government. (D) is incorrect because a bill of attainder is a legislative act that inflicts punishment without a judicial trial on individuals who are designated either by name or in terms of past conduct. No aspect of the law here constitutes a bill of attainder.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(D) The federal statute will be upheld if Congress had a rational basis for making the classifications that it did. Governmental actions involving classifications of persons are examined under one of three standards, regardless of whether it is a federal government action scrutinized under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause or a state government action reviewed under the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. If a suspect classification or fundamental right is

\title{
80. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW
}

involved, the strict scrutiny standard will be applied and the action will be struck down unless the government proves that it is necessary to achieve a compelling interest. If a quasi-suspect classification is involved, the Court will likely require the government to prove that the action is substantially related to an important government interest. If any other classification is involved, the action will be upheld unless the challenger proves that the action is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Here, the classification does not involve either suspect or quasisuspect classifications. While the regulations do have an incidental effect on marriage, which is a fundamental right, they are not creating a direct obstacle to the exercise of this right. Thus, the rational basis standard will apply to the classifications; the statute will be upheld if Congress could rationally conclude that an unmarried disabled child, or one who marries another disabled person, is more likely to be needy than one who marries a nondisabled person. (A) is incorrect because Congress's power to spend money to "provide for the common defense and the general welfare" is not unfettered. The Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause and other constitutional restrictions on the exercise of federal government power apply to congressional expenditures. (B) is incorrect because the receipt of disability payments has been held to be a property interest that cannot be terminated under the Due Process Clause without fair procedures. [Mathews v. Eldridge (1976)] Nor can Congress condition the receipt of these benefits on some ground that itself constitutes a violation of the Bill of Rights. (C) is wrong because the fact that the classification will save the government money is not enough to make the classification rational. Congress could have instead retained benefits only for disabled persons who marry nondisabled persons; the classification would save the government money but it would be difficult to uphold even under a rational basis standard. Choice (D) offers the best justification for upholding the classification under the rational basis standard.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(C) A law containing gender-based classifications must be shown by its proponent to be substantially related to important government interests. State laws that discriminate by treating people in similar situations in dissimilar ways are subject to challenge under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court usually applies one of three tests for evaluating an equal protection challenge to a statute. Where the classification relates to who may exercise a fundamental right or is based on a "suspect" characteristic, the classification must be necessary to promote a compelling state interest. Where the classification relates only to matters of economics or social welfare, it is valid if it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. For quasi-suspect classifications, the Court has applied an intermediate standard, upholding the law if its proponent can show, by an exceedingly persuasive justification, that the classification is substantially related to important governmental interests. A distinction based on gender, such as the provision in the Margate statute for free financial counseling to single mothers but not to single fathers in the same financial situation, is a quasi-suspect classification. Thus, to win the case, Margate must show that favoring mothers over fathers is substantially related to an important governmental interest. (A) is incorrect because a classification based on gender is subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny, requiring a "substantial" rather than "rational" relation and an "important" governmental interest rather than merely a "legitimate" governmental interest. (B) is incorrect because gender is not a suspect classification that requires the compelling state interest test to be applied. Even if it were, Peter would not have the burden of proving absence of a compelling interest; Margate would have to prove the existence of a compelling interest for the law to be upheld. (D) is wrong for similar reasons: gender is an "almost suspect" class that requires a showing of more than just a rational relationship, and, even if that test were appropriate, it would require Peter to bear the burden of demonstrating that the law does $\boldsymbol{n o t}$ have a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. 

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(C) New Jingo cannot show a compelling state interest for treating resident aliens differently from other residents. Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, no state may deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. If a government statute classifies persons based on a "suspect" class, strict scrutiny will be applied (i.e., the statute will be upheld only if it is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose). State and local laws based on a person's alienage are subject to strict scrutiny; the state must show a compelling state interest to justify the disparate treatment. Here, Josh is a resident of New Jingo. The statute treats him differently from other residents, however, because of his status as an alien-all resident aliens are scrutinized to determine whether they were citizens of a country that had taken United States citizens hostage. The state here has no compelling interest to justify the classification; the statute appears to be simply a political statement on a foreign policy matter that the state has no power over. Hence, the Equal Protection Clause is Josh's best argument to strike down the statute. (A) is incorrect for two reasons: the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to citizens of the United States, and it only protects certain attributes of national citizenship (such as the right to vote for federal officials). Here, Josh is not a citizen of the United States, and the right to a higher education at a state university is not an attribute of national citizenship. (B) is incorrect because an ex post facto law is legislation that retroactively alters the criminal law in a substantially prejudicial manner. It does not apply to retroactive alteration of civil regulations, such as the right to attend a state university. (D) is wrong because Josh would have to overcome several hurdles to make an effective due process argument. Procedural due process principles, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provide that government shall not take a person's life, liberty, or property without due process of law. While property includes more than personal belongings, an abstract need for or unilateral expectation of the benefit is not enough. There must be a legitimate claim or "entitlement" to the benefit under state law. While there is a property interest in public education when school attendance is required, the Supreme Court has never specifically held that a property interest exists in public education at the college level. [See Board of Curators v. Horowitz (1978)] Even if Josh could persuade the court to make that assumption, he would also have to establish that imposing the higher tuition effectively deprives him of that property interest and that the registrar's procedures for denying him the lower tuition rate did not satisfy constitutional requirements. At best, he could require the university to give him a hearing before charging him the higher tuition. To strike down the statute itself, however, Josh's best argument is based on the Equal Protection Clause.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(D) Timon's constitutional arguments will fail because his firing by the school did not constitute state action. The Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause, which makes many of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, does not apply to purely private conduct that interferes with these rights. Thus, unless the private individual (i) was performing exclusively public functions, or (ii) took actions with significant state involvement, the individual's action is not unconstitutional. In this case, The Classical School is a private institution performing a function-education-that has never been considered to be an exclusively public function. [See Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925)] Furthermore, its licensing by the state and receipt of state funds do not constitute significant state involvement with regard to its personnel matters; thus, Timon cannot establish that the school exercised state action. [See Rendell-Baker v. Kohn (1982)] (A) is incorrect because constitutional protection for freedom of speech does not extend to actions taken by private individuals. Furthermore, even a public school probably could have fired Timon 

\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW}

for his speech (if its termination procedures were otherwise proper). Because public schools generally are not public forums, reasonable restrictions based on legitimate pedagogical concerns rather than the content of the speech are permissible. [Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser (1986)] The school reasonably could argue that urging the student assembly to organize a protest against a school policy would disrupt discipline and interfere with its educational process. (B) is incorrect for the same reason as (A): the constitutional right to due process of law does not apply to private conduct. Had Timon been fired by a public school, he would be able to claim a property right in his employment for the balance of his contract. The school probably would have had to provide him with a pretermination opportunity to respond to the charges against him. [Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill (1985)] (C) is incorrect; Timon did have property rights in his job because he had a three-year contract with the school. Had Timon instead been an employee-at-will, without a contract, he would have had no property interest in continued employment even if his employer had been a public school. [Bishop v. Wood (1976)]

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(C) Driller should prevail because Petrolia's law violates the Interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2. This clause, which provides that "citizens of each state shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of citizens in the several states," prohibits discrimination by a state against nonresidents when the discrimination involves "fundamental rights." Fundamental rights for purposes of this clause are those involving important commercial activities (such as pursuit of a livelihood) or civil liberties. Here, the statute directly discriminates against nonresidents of the state by banning their being hired as oilfield workers unless no qualified residents can be found. Because employment is a fundamental right for purposes of the Interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause, the court should find the statute unconstitutional. (A) is incorrect. A state law that mandates employment discrimination on grounds of race, religion, etc., will probably violate the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause, but that clause is not the only means of challenging discriminatory state laws. Discrimination based on state residency must pass muster under the Interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause. (B) is incorrect because the state cannot show a sufficient justification for discriminating against nonresidents. A state law requiring private sector employers to give hiring preference to residents will only be valid under the Privileges and Immunities Clause if the state can show that (i) the nonresidents are the cause or source of the problem it is attempting to solve, and (ii) there are no less restrictive means to solve the problem. [Hicklin v. Orbeck (1978)] In this case, Petrolia's high unemployment was caused by the drop in petroleum prices rather than by a large influx of nonresident workers, and state encouragement of alternative industries would be a less discriminatory alternative than what amounted to a total ban on the hiring of nonresidents. Hence, neither element of this test is satisfied, and the statute will not be valid under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. (D) is wrong because the Contract Clause prohibits states only from enacting any law that retroactively impairs contract rights. It does not affect contracts not yet entered into. Thus, a hiring law would not implicate the Contract Clause.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(B) The court will probably find the statute unconstitutional as an improper restriction of commercial speech. If the speech regulated concerns a lawful activity and is not misleading or fraudulent, the regulation will be valid if it (i) serves a substantial government interest, (ii) directly advances the interest, and (iii) is narrowly tailored to serve the substantial interest. While this test does not require that the least restrictive means be used, there must be a reasonable fit between the legislation's end and the means chosen. The greater the restriction on speech, the less likely it will be deemed to be reasonable. The Supreme Court has never upheld a complete ban on truthful advertising of a lawful product because such a restriction is not narrowly tailored. [See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island (1996)] Hence, the complete ban on advertising of tobacco products probably will be an unconstitutional infringement on freedom of speech. (A) is incorrect because the state's decision not to ban the sale of tobacco products does not preclude it from asserting a substantial interest in discouraging the sale or use of the products; regulations restricting advertising of the products clearly serve a substantial interest, satisfying the first prong of the test. (C) is wrong because regulation of speech is more likely to violate the First Amendment than regulation of conduct. Here, while the state's power to ban tobacco products would not raise First Amendment issues, the ban on advertising for a product does, and the constitutional requirements for regulations of commercial speech must be satisfied. Had the state chosen to make sale of tobacco products illegal, it could have banned advertising of the products, but since it chose not to make their sale illegal, any restrictions on advertising for the products have to satisfy the test described above. (D) is incorrect because the standard for testing the validity of commercial speech regulations is more stringent than the "rational basis" test. As stated above, the regulation must be narrowly tailored to directly advance a substantial government interest.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(A) The anti-littering ordinance will be upheld because it furthers an important government interest unrelated to the content of the communication and is narrowly tailored to the furtherance of that interest. As a general rule, conduct that is intended to communicate is not immune from reasonable government regulation, even though it takes place in a public forum such as a park. The noncommunicative impact of speech-related conduct in a public forum can be regulated to further an important government interest independent of the speech aspects of the conduct as long as the incidental restriction on the ability to communicate that message is narrowly tailored to further the interest in question, so that alternative channels for communicating the message are available. The prevention of litter, as a means of maintaining public facilities in usable condition and protecting property values, is an important enough government interest to allow some type of regulation. The ban on littering is narrowly tailored to accomplish its purpose, unlike, for example, a ban on distributing leaflets that may end up on the ground. The regulation probably would not have precluded Demagoga even from dumping the barrel if she had picked up the trash after her speech was over. (B) is incorrect because it is too broad; some speech-related conduct cannot be punished (e.g., burning a flag). The critical distinction is whether the offense relates to the communicative content of the conduct or to state interests independent of its communicative aspects. (C) is incorrect because the conduct aspect of symbolic speech can be regulated under the test indicated above. (D) is incorrect because the compelling interest standard only applies where the restrictions are based on the content of the message being communicated. Where the regulation is not based on content, the government need show only an important interest.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(B) The action of the board is impermissible because it establishes a preference for some religious sects over others without a compelling interest. Under the Establishment Clause, if a law or government program includes a preference for some religious sects over others, the law will be held invalid unless it is narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest. Here, there is no legitimate reason for not extending the exemption to the Church of the Sunrise; the government is not permitted to classify religions based on a particular religion's popularity or the credibility of its beliefs. (A) is incorrect because the courts may not declare a religious belief to 

\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW}

be false. Hence, regardless of what the board "proves," it may not refuse to apply the exemption. (C) is wrong because the accommodation of religion by the exemption is a permissible government purpose and has only an incidental effect of advancing religion. [See Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos (1987)] (D) is incorrect. The state probably could abolish its exemption for religious employers without violating the Free Exercise Clause, because the antidiscrimination statute is a law of general applicability that was apparently not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion. However, since it does provide an exemption for religious employers, it is not permitted to discriminate among them.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(B) Congress may constitutionally regulate wages and hours of state and local employees under its commerce power. The Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8 vests in Congress broad powers to regulate any activity, local or interstate, which either in itself or in combination with other activities has a substantial economic effect upon, or effect on movement in, interstate commerce. Under this approach, Congress clearly has the power to regulate wages and hours of those employed by private employers. [See United States v. Darby (1941)] This power has been held applicable to state and local governments; Congress can therefore require state or local governments to follow the provisions of federal legislation requiring a state or private employer to pay overtime wages to its employees. [Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985)] Thus, Patchquilt will not succeed in its challenge to the statute. (A) is incorrect because the statute's constitutionality is not dependent on the Necessary and Proper Clause, which permits Congress to exercise auxiliary powers that are "necessary and proper" for carrying out Congress's enumerated powers. The power to require state and private employers to pay overtime wages to their employees comes directly from Congress's enumerated power to regulate commerce among the states. (C) is incorrect because the Court has abandoned former holdings that the Tenth Amendment precluded Congress from regulating areas involving the traditional functions of state and local governments. A court is unlikely to strike down on Tenth Amendment grounds a law such as the one here that subjects state and local governments to regulations that are equally applicable to the private sector. (D) is incorrect because the state police power does not prevail over a federal statute based on Congress's power over interstate commerce. Patchquilt's health and safety concerns regarding the garbage can only be resolved by paying overtime wages or hiring additional employees.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(C) The statute banning Grippers is an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce even though an equally safe alternative is available in all 50 states. If Congress has not enacted laws regarding a subject, a state may regulate local aspects of interstate commerce if the regulation: (i) does not discriminate against out-of-state competition to benefit local economic interests; and (ii) is not unduly burdensome (i.e., the incidental burden on interstate commerce does not outweigh the legitimate local benefits). The facts do not suggest that Congress has regulated the subject of truck tires on state roads. The facts also do not indicate whether Grippers or Grabbers are manufactured in State Grapefruit, so discrimination in favor of local economic interests is absent. The final test is a balancing test to determine whether the regulation is unduly burdensome, and here the regulation probably will fail. In Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines (1959), the Supreme Court invalidated an Illinois statute requiring trucks to use contour mudguards rather than flat mudguards. One aspect of the burden on commerce in that case was that another state required flat mudguards rather than contour mudguards, precluding trucking companies from using one type of mudguard in all 50 states and indicating that the safety benefits that Illinois was claiming for contour mudguards had not been conclusively established. Because Grabbers are now legal in all 50 states, the burden on interstate commerce is not as great in this case. Nevertheless, it is still significant. By not permitting equally safe alternative types of tires, which might be cheaper or more readily available than Grabbers, Grapefruit is imposing an undue burden on all trucking companies in other states whose trailers might at some time pass through Grapefruit. On the other side of the equation, the Illinois mudguard regulation in Bibb arguably was a safety measure, which is an area of legitimate local concern. Here, there is no evidence of any safety benefit; both types of tires have been deemed equally safe by independent testing labs. On balance, therefore, the statute is unconstitutional because its incidental burden on interstate commerce outweighs any legitimate local benefits. (A) is incorrect because the equivalence in safety makes the state's argument weaker. Had Grabbers been shown to be substantially safer than Grippers, the state would be able to argue that a legitimate local benefit outweighs the burden on interstate commerce. $(\mathrm{B})$ is incorrect because the state power to regulate highway safety is not absolute, but must be balanced against the federal commerce power. If a safety regulation imposes a significant burden on interstate commerce, particularly where the objective of the regulation could be achieved by less restrictive alternatives, the Court will probably find it unconstitutional. (D) is incorrect for two reasons. First, the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV applies only to citizens of a state, and neither the trade association nor the corporations it is composed of are considered citizens of a state. More importantly, the Clause only prohibits discrimination by a state in favor of its own citizens concerning fundamental rights. Even an individual truck driver who is a citizen of another state could not use the Clause to challenge the Grapefruit statute because it also bars Grapefruit residents from using the tires.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(C) Executive agreements with other governments fall within the President's broad power over foreign relations and will supersede conflicting state laws. Although executive agreements are not expressly provided for in the Constitution, they have become institutionalized in practice. Because they are not ratified by the Senate as treaties are, they cannot override a valid federal statute, but they are supreme over conflicting state laws to the same extent as a treaty. (A) is incorrect even though the probate of property generally is within a state's exclusive power as far as regulation is concerned. Where this activity also falls within the federal government's exclusive power over international affairs, any conflicting state regulations are superseded. (B) is incorrect because, as against state law, an executive agreement has the same effect as a treaty. Unless in violation of federal constitutional provisions, an executive agreement takes precedence over state law. (D) is incorrect because the Full Faith and Credit Clause of Article IV, Section 1 requires only that each state recognize the laws and judicial proceedings of every other state. It has no application to executive agreements made by the President.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(D) The best reason to uphold the statute is that it reflects the balance of power between the President and Congress over war. The Constitution makes the President the commander in chief of the armed forces, but it gives Congress the power to declare war and raise an army and navy. The Supreme Court has never delineated the extent of either branch's power under these clauses, but clearly the power over war is shared. Since none of the other answers is correct, (D) is the only viable alternative. (A) is incorrect because it is too broad. The President need not obtain the advice and consent of the Senate concerning all foreign affairs, but only with regard to treaties. Moreover, nothing in the Constitution requires the President to obtain the advice and consent 

\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW}

of the Senate regarding how to wage a war. (B) is incorrect because it is too narrow. The President's power as commander in chief has historically extended beyond the power to repel invasions. At the very least, it has also included the power to protect citizens abroad. (C) is incorrect because the President has the power, as commander in chief, to send troops to another country even in the absence of a declaration of war (e.g., to protect United States citizens).

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(A) Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution extends the federal judicial power only to "cases and controversies"; the Supreme Court has interpreted this requirement to prohibit rendition of advisory opinions. The opinion sought here is advisory since the law in question has not yet been passed. Had the legislation already been passed in its present form, the Court could have rendered a declaratory judgment even if the state had not yet attempted to enforce the law, because the "controversy" would be genuine. In this case, however, the legislation is not in its final form and ultimately may not be applied against Master Minerals' operation even if it becomes law. (B) and (C) are incorrect because the Court should refuse to hear the case altogether. It is irrelevant that the state supreme court has given an advisory opinion on the matter. (D) has the correct result but for the wrong reason. While a federal court should refuse to hear a case that turned on state law, the challenge here was that the law was unconstitutional, which may refer not only to its state constitutional status but also to its federal constitutional status, requiring a decision turning on federal law.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(C) The court should dismiss the action because Rupert cannot show that he has an injury that will be remedied by a decision in his favor. Even if a federal court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case, it will not decide a constitutional challenge to a government action unless the person challenging the action has "standing" to raise the constitutional issue, i.e., a concrete stake in the outcome of the controversy. This requires plaintiff to show an injury in fact-caused by government conduct-that will be remedied by a decision in her favor. Here, Rupert cannot establish that whatever injury he might have suffered by having his purchase blocked would be remedied by an injunction against the subsequent transaction; hence, he does not have standing to obtain an injunction against the sale to Sumner. (A) is incorrect. While Rupert could claim that the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause forbids discriminatory treatment in the exercise of a First Amendment right to be a broadcaster, that argument is unlikely to succeed (as discussed below). In any case, the court will not consider the merits of his argument because he does not have standing to enjoin the purchase by Sumner. (B) is incorrect because, even if Rupert were able to establish standing, the FCC may regulate ownership of the broadcast media by forbidding ownership of a radio or television station by a daily newspaper located in the same community, as a means of promoting the diversity of information received by the public. (D) is wrong even though it is a true statement (as discussed above). The court would not even reach the merits of Rupert's case before dismissing it; it would dismiss the action on the basis of Rupert's lack of standing to challenge the sale of the station to Sumner.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(A) The court should grant Bob's motion because the Eleventh Amendment generally prohibits a federal court from hearing a private party's claim against its own or another state government. This jurisdictional bar includes actions against a state government for injunctive or declaratory relief where the state itself, rather than state officials, is named as a party. Here, the citizens' group is seeking an injunction against the state legislature itself rather than a state official. Thus, the action would be barred by the Eleventh Amendment. (B) is not as good an answer as (A) because political questions generally involve issues committed by the Constitution to one of the other branches of the federal government and issues lacking well-developed judicial standards for resolution and enforcement. Here, the lawsuit is alleging that the state legislature will violate the Establishment Clause if it allows Bob to take office. This issue does not involve other branches of the federal government and, at the same time, allows the court to use extensive Establishment Clause precedent to reach a decision in the case. Hence, the court is not likely to dismiss the lawsuit on political question grounds. (C) is wrong because standing to challenge an expenditure as a violation of the Establishment Clause is limited to specific enactment under the government's taxing and spending power. Even though state funds might be expended in this case as a routine part of the legislative privileges granted to Bob, it is not an expenditure that falls within the Establishment Clause exception. (D) is incorrect because, as discussed above, an action seeking injunctive relief against the state as a party is also barred by the Eleventh Amendment.

\section{CONTRACTS ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(A) Babe can recover because, under the modern trend, the preexisting duty rule does not apply if the duty is owed to a third person. Generally, contracts must be supported by consideration. A promise to perform is valid consideration, but if a person already owes a duty to perform, traditionally that performance cannot be used as consideration for another promise. Thus, under the traditional rule, Babe could not enforce Joe's promise to pay Babe $\$ 5,000$ if Babe hit a home run because Babe gave no valid consideration in exchange for Joe's promise, since Babe owed a preexisting duty to his ball club to exert his best efforts to hit home runs. However, under the modern view as formulated in Restatement (Second) of Contracts, section 73 , a duty is a preexisting duty only if it is owed to the promisor. Thus, a promise to perform a duty is valid consideration as long as the duty of performance is not already owed to the promisee. In other words, if the duty is owed to a third party, a promise to perform given to another is valid consideration as long as it was bargained for. (B) is incorrect because there is no exception to the preexisting duty rule-modern or otherwise-that allows the promisor to recover merely because his performance benefited the third party. Babe can recover under the modern approach because his promise to Jimmy's father was bargained for. Conversely, Babe does not have to prove that the value of his home run to Jimmy was at least $\$ 5,000$, because courts generally will not inquire into the adequacy of consideration. (C) would be correct under the traditional rule, but this question is one of the few questions where you are asked about and expected to know the modern trend. As explained above, under the modern trend, the promise here is valid consideration because the duty to hit home runs was owed to a third party (the ball club) rather than to the promisee (Joe). (D) is wrong because while it is true that moral consideration is not good consideration, Joe did not rely on moral consideration, but rather exchanged a promise to pay $\$ 5,000$ for Babe's performance.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(B) Where a past obligation would be enforceable except for a technical defense to enforcement, a new promise in writing will be enforceable even in the absence of any new consideration. As a general rule, a contract requires a bargained-for exchange between the parties as consideration; "past" or "moral" consideration is usually insufficient. Among the many exceptions to this rule is where a technical defense such as the statute of limitations bars enforcement of the prior obligation and a new promise is made in writing. In such a case, courts will state that the "moral" consideration is sufficient consideration for the new agreement or that the existence of the prior obligation is a substitute for consideration. Regardless of how the courts characterize it, the new promise will be enforceable only according to its terms, not the terms of the original obligation. Hence, Cheap is entitled to recover $\$ 600$ on the basis of Deadbeat's signed letter promising to pay that amount. (A) is incorrect because the new agreement has no effect on the original obligation. The new agreement is what is being enforced, not the original obligation. Had Deadbeat instead promised to pay "the debt I owed to Cheap," the new agreement would be enforceable for $\$ 1,000$. (C) is incorrect because the statute of limitations just bars the judicial remedies for enforcing the prior agreement; it does not nullify the agreement. Hence, the prior agreement may serve as a substitute for consideration if a new agreement is made. (D) is incorrect because, as discussed above, no additional consideration is needed for the agreement to pay $\$ 600$.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(A) United Leasing is contractually bound to lease the skybox to Multimedia. Under certain circumstances, an executory bilateral contract may be formed without any communication of 

\section{CONTRACTS}

acceptance. A common example is where prior dealings between the parties, or trade practices known to both, create a commercially reasonable expectation by the offeror that silence represents an acceptance. In such a case, the offeree is under a duty to notify the offeror if it does not intend to accept. Here, despite the language in the invitation making leases subject to approval, United never sent any notification of approval prior to sending out the tickets and invoice right before the season would start. This course of dealing over the past five years gave Multimedia reason to expect that United's silence after the invitation was returned constituted an acceptance by United, regardless of United's actual intent. [See Restatement (Second) of Contracts $\S 69$, illus. 5] (B) is incorrect because the language stating that approval would be required precludes the invitation from constituting an offer. Multimedia's response constitutes the offer and incorporates the term relating to approval by management of United Leasing. Thus, United had the power to reject Multimedia's offer if it acted within a reasonable time. Its failure to do so, given the course of dealing between the parties, constituted an acceptance. (C) is wrong because, as stated above, United Leasing had a duty to reject Multimedia's offer within a commercially reasonable time. Its delay of over two months before notifying Multimedia right before the season began, after Multimedia had scheduled clients to use the skybox, was not commercially reasonable under the circumstances. (D) is incorrect because Multimedia would not have to rely on a quasi-contract theory to recover its reliance damages. As discussed above, Multimedia was correct in its assertion that a contract was created between the parties and that United Leasing would be in breach if it did not perform. Multimedia would then be entitled to all appropriate contract remedies, including reliance damages.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(B) Bernaise and Hollandaise formed a contract when they agreed on all salient points after negotiations. One element of their agreement was that the terms would be put in writing, a process sometimes called "memorializing" the agreement. The writing does not constitute the agreement itself, but is merely a written record of it. Another element of their oral agreement concerned when it would take effect: upon completion of the "memorialization." Hobson's failure to initial the writing, whether deliberate or inadvertent, was not the failure of a condition, but rather a breach of the oral agreement that he would do so. (A) is incorrect because the oral agreement was already in effect at the time the writing was mailed. The processes of offer and acceptance took place during the oral negotiations. Even if the mailing of the writing could somehow be seen as an offer, there are no facts, such as detrimental reliance, that show it to be irrevocable. (C) is incorrect because the better view, as described above, is that the writing was a memorial of the existing oral agreement. Even if the requirement of Hobson's initialing were an express condition, Hollandaise would probably not be permitted to prevent the occurrence of the condition and then claim the benefit of its nonoccurrence. (D) is incorrect because acceptance had already taken place upon the parties' reaching oral agreement. This choice appears to invoke the mailbox rule but gets it wrong, since a mailed acceptance is generally effective upon posting (which occurred prior to the phone call), not upon receipt. In any event, the mailbox rule is not applicable to these facts.

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(C) The extreme difficulty and expense of repairing or replacing the oven constitutes a good faith reason for FGF to cancel the contract, as it is entitled to do under the contract. Thus, GM will not prevail. Reservation of an unqualified right to cancel or withdraw from a contract at any time may amount to an illusory promise. However, the promise is not illusory, and there is a valid consideration, if the right to cancel is restricted in any way. Here, the right of either FGF or GM to cancel is restricted because it must be preceded by reasonable notice to the other party. In addition, the Code's implied requirement of good faith in all sales contracts imposes an additional restriction on the parties' right to cancel. Therefore, the promises are not illusory, and both parties are bound. FGF finds itself confronted with circumstances that present extreme and unreasonable difficulty and expense in complying with its contractual duties of supplying pate. While this additional test might not be sufficient to discharge FGF's duties on grounds of impracticability, it is clearly grounds for supplying FGF with a good faith reason for canceling the contract. (A) is incorrect because FGF is entitled to cancel the contract for a good faith reason upon giving reasonable notice. It is not necessary to show impossibility. (B) is incorrect because the fact that the parties agreed to a cancellation provision indicates that FGF did not assume all risks of increased expenses in making pate. The unreasonable amount of expense and difficulty involved with the repair and/or replacement of the oven supports FGF's good faith decision to cancel the contract. (D) is incorrect because, while some courts have found promises to be illusory if the contract provided for an unqualified right to cancel the contract at any time, here the right to cancel is restricted by requirements of good faith reasons for cancellation as well as giving reasonable notice.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(B) Plunger can be held liable because its offer will be deemed irrevocable for a reasonable length of time on a theory of promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel renders an offer binding as an option contract even without consideration if the offeror should reasonably expect it to induce action or forbearance of a substantial character by the offeree before acceptance, and such action or forbearance is in fact induced. [Restatement (Second) of Contracts §87] Plunger offered to do the work for $\$ 10,000$ if Jenny was awarded the contract. Plunger should have expected that Jenny would use this figure to prepare her bid and that if she was awarded the contract she would be bound. This is what occurred. The measure of Jenny's damages is the amount she reasonably paid for a substitute performance, less the amount saved as a consequence of the breach; i.e., the $\$ 12,000$ paid to Flusher minus the $\$ 10,000$ not paid to Plunger, or $\$ 2,000$. (A) is incorrect because Jenny has not yet paid Plunger anything and has only suffered $\$ 2,000$ in damages. Jenny, therefore, is only entitled to the measure of damages described above. (C) is incorrect because it is irrelevant that Jenny paid a reasonable price for the substitute performance. In the absence of awareness on her part of Plunger's mistake, which is not indicated here, she was entitled to have the work done for the contract price, or to receive damages for the difference between the contract price and the cost of the substitute performance. (D) is incorrect because Jenny is entitled to relief even if she did not "accept" Plunger's bid, because she detrimentally relied on it by using it in her bid.

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(C) Jenny did not accept Ohmco's bid even though she used it to prepare her bid. Jenny's advertisement constituted an invitation for subcontractors to make offers. Ohmco's bid constituted an offer. The general rule is that acceptance of an offer must be communicated to the offeror, and here Jenny did not communicate any acceptance to Ohmco. Although statutes in some cases may create an exception to the general rule by making acceptance of a subcontractor bid automatic upon the general contractor's being awarded the contract, no such exception is indicated by these facts. (A) is incorrect because the facts do not reveal any basis for an inference that Jenny would use the lowest bid. Typically, a contractor will consider other factors as well, such as reputation or past performance, in deciding which bid to accept. (B) is incorrect even though Ohmco's bid could be treated as an offer for an option contract. Here, the acceptance of the option contract to 

\section{CONTRACTS}

keep the bid open occurred when Jenny relied on the bid to prepare her own bid. [See Restatement (Second) of Contracts $\S 87]$ The award of the general contract had no effect on the option contract and did not create an acceptance of the offer for the electrical contract (as discussed above). (D) is incorrect, although it is factually a true statement. Jenny's advertisement was an invitation for offers, not an offer in itself. The offer on these facts was made by Ohmco, and the reason no enforceable contract exists is that Jenny never accepted Ohmco's offer.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(B) Betsy will prevail because complete destruction of the dictionary results in avoidance of the contract and discharge of her duty to pay, since Stan still had the risk of loss. Since the contract here is for the sale of goods, it is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code ("U.C.C."). Under the U.C.C., if a contract requires for its performance particular goods identified when the contract is made, and, before risk of loss passes to the buyer, the goods are destroyed without the fault of either party, the contract is avoided. [U.C.C. §2-613] All of the elements of section 2-613 are present here. The contract required Stan's particular dictionary, which was identified at the time the contract was made. The risk of loss had not yet passed to Betsy because in a sale by a nonmerchant such as Stan, risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until tender [U.C.C. §2-509], and Stan never tendered the dictionary here (there was no actual tender and delivery was not due until April 20). Finally, the fire was caused by Hugh's careless smoking, and so the goods were destroyed without the fault of either party. Thus, the contract is avoided. (The same conclusion would result under the common law doctrine of impossibility-all executory duties are discharged when the subsequent destruction of the subject matter of a contract renders performance impossible.) (A) is incorrect because the U.C.C. contains no such rule. The only U.C.C. remedy that depends on an injured party's insurance involves the risk of loss after the buyer's revocation of acceptance or wrongful repudiation under section 2-510. Here, Betsy does not have to pay because the destruction of the dictionary discharged her duty to do so. (C) is wrong because, as explained above, the risk of loss had not yet passed to Betsy. (D) is wrong because the U.C.C. does not follow the doctrine of equitable conversion; rather, the Code contains very specific risk of loss rules, as detailed above.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(D) Bluto will not be liable to Olive because Bluto's duty to purchase ads was excused by Popeye's failure to use Bluto's repair shop exclusively. The facts indicate that Popeye and Bluto entered into a valid contract that required Bluto to render some performance to Olive. Olive is an intended third-party beneficiary because (i) she was expressly designated in the contract, (ii) some performance is to be made directly to her, and (iii) she stands in such a relationship to the promisee (she is Popeye's wife) that an intent to benefit her can be inferred. She can enforce the contract because her rights have vested; she has materially changed position in justifiable reliance on the promise by turning down work from two prospective clients because of the time Bluto's ads would take. However, when the third-party beneficiary sues the promisor on the contract, the promisor may assert any defenses to formation or performance that he would have been able to assert against the promisee, including failure of a condition. Bluto's promise to perform by placing all of his ads with Olive during the term of the agreement was dependent on the condition that Popeye have all of his buses repaired by Bluto. The failure of Popeye to fulfill this condition excused Bluto's duty to continue to place ads with Olive, and Bluto will be able to assert this defense to performance against Olive. (A) is incorrect because Olive's partial performance does not create a duty for Bluto to continue placing the ads. Bluto's duty is also dependent on performance by Popeye. (B) is incorrect because Olive's detrimental reliance only establishes that her rights in the contract have vested. Thus, she can bring a contract action against Bluto, but Bluto will have a defense. (C) is incorrect because a third party can acquire rights in a contract as an intended beneficiary even though she provided no consideration. The fact that Olive may be a donee beneficiary would not prevent her from enforcing the contract.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(C) Because Olive's rights as a beneficiary had not vested, Popeye and Bluto had a right to modify their agreement without her permission. A contract that benefits a third party may confer rights on that party if she is an intended beneficiary rather than merely an incidental beneficiary. Olive is an intended beneficiary of the agreement between Popeye and Bluto because (i) she was expressly designated in the contract, (ii) some performance is to be made directly to her, and (iii) she stands in a close relationship to the promisee (Popeye), suggesting that he intended for her to benefit. However, an intended beneficiary can enforce the contract only after her rights have vested. Vesting will occur when the beneficiary (i) manifests assent to the promise in a manner invited or requested by the parties, (ii) brings suit to enforce the promise, or (iii) materially changes position in justifiable reliance on the promise. In contrast to the facts in the previous question, the facts for this question do not indicate any action on Olive's part that would have caused her rights to vest before the change in the contract extinguished her rights. (A) is incorrect even though it is a true statement. An intended beneficiary can enforce the contract only after her rights have vested, and here Olive's rights had not vested. $(\mathrm{B})$ is incorrect because Olive had no contract with Bluto. Any rights that she had were through the contract between Popeye and Bluto. (D) is incorrect. Olive can be classified as a donee beneficiary because the promisee (Popeye) is gratuitously conferring a benefit on the third party (Olive). However, a donee beneficiary is still an intended beneficiary under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts section 302. Had Olive's rights in the contract vested before they were extinguished, her divorce from Popeye would not have prevented her from enforcing the contract.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(B) Bill can sue only Moran for breach. The effect of a valid assignment of contract rights is to establish privity of contract between the obligor and the assignee while extinguishing privity between the obligor and assignor. The assignee then replaces the assignor as the real party in interest and he alone is entitled to performance under the contract. As the real party in interest, he may enforce his rights against the obligor directly. Here, Alice (the assignor) has assigned to Bill (the assignee) the right to receive the performance of the contract by Moran (the obligor). Because Moran has materially breached the contract by departing from the specifications and using a cheaper paneling, Bill can sue Moran for breach. (A) and (D) are incorrect because Bill has no grounds for suing Alice (the assignor). The assignor does not guarantee that the obligor will perform the contract for the assignee. The assignor only warrants that she will not wrongfully exercise her power to revoke the assignment and that the obligor does not have any defenses against the assignor unknown to the assignee that can be successfully asserted if the assignee seeks to enforce the obligation. Here, Alice did not try to revoke the assignment and Moran does not appear to have any defenses against Alice. Thus, Bill cannot sue Alice. (C) is incorrect because Nicholls has no duties under the contract; he just has the right to receive payment. Unless a contrary intention appears, courts will construe language assigning "the contract" as including an assumption of the duties by the assignee. Here, however, Moran assigned only his right to payment to Nicholls and continued to perform the duties under the contract himself. Thus, no delegation of duties will be implied and Nicholls cannot be sued for breach. 

\section{CONTRACTS}

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(B) Alice will have to pay Nicholls because she remains liable on the contract. This question builds on the previous question by adding delegation of duty issues to the assignment of rights analysis. A transfer of contractual duties to a third party is called a "delegation" of duties. However, the party delegating her duties (the delegator-obligor) remains liable on her contract, even if the third person (the delegate) expressly assumes the duties (i.e., promises that he will perform the duties delegated). When the delegate promises that he will perform the duty delegated and the promise is supported by consideration or its equivalent, an assumption occurs; the nondelegating party (Nicholls) becomes a third-party beneficiary of the assumption agreement and can sue either the delegate who assumed the duty (Bill) or the delegator who remains liable on the contract (Alice). As between those two, the delegate is the principal and the delegator is the surety-if the delegator were sued on the contract, she could obtain reimbursement from the delegate based on the assumption agreement. In this case, therefore, Alice (the delegator-obligor) is still liable on the contract even though she delegated to Bill her duty to pay for the remodeling. On the other side of the contract, Nicholls is the assignee of Moran's right to payment under the contract and therefore can seek enforcement of the contract directly against Alice. (A) is incorrect because a clause prohibiting assignment of "the contract" is generally construed as barring only the delegation of the assignor's duties, not the right to receive payment from the obligor; thus, a general prohibition on assignments would not prevent Nicholls from recovering against Alice. Furthermore, a provision in a contract stating specifically that contractual rights may not be assigned is usually ineffective. In other words, the assignor retains the power to assign even though he may be liable for breach of contract, and the assignee may enforce the contract. Thus, the existence of a nonassignment clause in the contract between Alice and Moran would not have deprived Moran of the power to assign his rights to Nicholls. (C) is incorrect because, as discussed above, one who delegates her duties under a contract remains liable on the contract. (D) is wrong because the breach by Moran would be considered a minor breach and would not relieve either Bill or Alice of their duty to pay. A breach of contract is minor if the obligee gains the substantial benefit of her bargain despite the obligor's defective performance. While the aggrieved party may have a right to any provable damages for the breach, she is not relieved of her duty of performance under the contract. To reach this result, the court may treat the paneling specification only as a promise by Moran and not as a condition to Bill and Alice's duty to pay. Alternatively, if complying with the paneling specification is considered a condition to the duty to pay, the court will excuse the condition under the doctrine of substantial performance, which is particularly applicable to construction contracts. Excuse of the condition makes Alice's duty to pay absolute. Since the two imported hardwoods are virtually identical and used interchangeably in the construction industry, Moran has substantially performed under the contract and his breach of contract will be considered minor. Hence, Alice will be liable to pay him for the work.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(A) Because Trendee accepted delivery of the 40 swimsuits, which was Stingray's counteroffer to Trendee's initial order, a contract was created for the 40 suits at $\$ 10$ each. As a general rule, advertisements, catalogs, and other price quotations are construed as invitations for offers rather than offers. If the language of the catalog could be construed as a definite promise to specific offerees, a court might construe it as an offer, but there is no evidence in this question for such an interpretation. Trendee's order is therefore an offer to purchase 100 swimsuits; because goods are involved, U.C.C. Article 2 applies. Under U.C.C. section 2-206(1)(b), an offer to buy goods for prompt shipment is construed as inviting acceptance either by a promise to ship or by prompt shipment of conforming or nonconforming goods. In this case, Stingray shipped goods that did not conform to the quantity term of Trendee's offer. The Code provides that the shipment of nonconforming goods amounts to both an acceptance of the offer and a breach of the newly formed contract unless the shipper precedes or accompanies the shipment with notice that it is offered as an accommodation. Here, Stingray notified Trendee at the time of its shipment that it would not be able to satisfy the balance of Trendee's order this season. This accommodation notice makes Stingray's shipment a counteroffer, which Trendee accepted by taking delivery and beginning to sell the swimsuits. Stingray is therefore entitled to $\$ 400$, the price specified by the counteroffer. (B) is incorrect because Stingray's shipment of the 40 swimsuits was not a breach of contract. Had Stingray failed to notify Trendee that its shipment was an accommodation, however, the shipment would have been a nonconforming acceptance and a breach of the contract, entitling Trendee to deduct its cover damages from what it owes Stingray. [U.C.C. §2-711] (C) is incorrect because Stingray is entitled to recover the price it specified in its notice of accommodation (which had made Stingray's shipment a counteroffer). By accepting the swimsuits and beginning to sell them, Trendee accepted Stingray's offer at the price it specified. (D) is incorrect because, as discussed above, Stingray's shipment was not a breach of contract. Even if it were, Stingray would still be entitled to recover for the goods Trendee accepted, minus Trendee's cover costs.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(B) An enforceable contract exists between WidgeCo and Distrucorp, but it does not include the limitation of liability added by Distrucorp's president. At common law, any different or additional terms in an acceptance of an offer made the response a rejection and counteroffer. In contracts for the sale of goods, however, U.C.C. section 2-207 substantially alters the common law rule. The proposal of additional terms by the offeree in a definite and timely acceptance does not constitute a rejection and counteroffer. Rather, the acceptance is effective unless it is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional terms. If both parties to the sale of goods contract are merchants, the additional terms will become part of the contract unless (i) they materially alter the contract, (ii) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer, or (iii) the offeror has already objected to the particular terms, or he objects within a reasonable time after notice of them is received. Here, a sale of goods contract is involved and both parties are merchants. Distrucorp accepted WidgeCo's offer by mailing back a standard printed acceptance form, even though the form contained an additional limitation of liability term added by Distrucorp's president. This limitation of liability provision did not become part of the contract, however, because it would have substantially changed the allocation of economic risks and benefits and impaired an otherwise available remedy. Hence, a valid contract exists between the parties but it is limited to the terms of WidgeCo's offer. (A) is incorrect because the material alteration by Distrucorp does not prevent formation of the contract under section 2-207, but the term that produces the material alteration will not be a part of the contract. (C) is incorrect. The additional term does not become part of the contract, even though WidgeCo raised no objection to it, because it materially altered the contract. An additional term will only become part of the contract if it is not a material alteration and if the offeror does not object to it within a reasonable time. Hence, WidgeCo's failure to object did not cause the term to be included in the contract. (D) is incorrect because under section 2-207, Distrucorp's response to WidgeCo was an acceptance rather than a counteroffer. For the response to have been a counteroffer rather than an acceptance, it would have had to expressly condition acceptance upon WidgeCo's assent to the additional term. 

\section{CONTRACTS}

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(C) A contract was formed for $\$ 10,000$ because the oral modification is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. Under the U.C.C., a contract for the sale of goods priced at $\$ 500$ or more is not enforceable unless evidenced by a writing. Furthermore, contract modifications must also meet the Statute of Frauds requirement if the contract as modified is within the Statute's provisions. Here, the Statute of Frauds is applicable to both the original contract and the contract as modified. Since the modification was not in writing, it is not enforceable; hence, the terms of the original contract, which satisfies Statute of Frauds requirements, are effective. (A) is wrong even though Tekmart did accept before October 31 and no additional consideration was needed for the oral modification. Because the Statute of Frauds is applicable to the modification, the $1 \%$ discount is not effective. (B) is wrong because the parol evidence rule is applicable only to oral expressions made prior to or contemporaneous with the written contract; parol evidence can be offered to show subsequent modifications of a written contract. Since the contract was created when Tekmart dispatched the letter (as discussed below), the agreement regarding the $1 \%$ discount is a subsequent modification and therefore unaffected by the parol evidence rule. (D) is incorrect because the mailbox rule is applicable to the facts here; the acceptance was effective on dispatch. If Tekmart had sent its rejection before its acceptance, the mailbox rule would not apply and the rejection would take effect because it arrived before the acceptance. However, since Tekmart sent its acceptance first and then its rejection, and Megabyte did not change its position in reliance on the rejection, the mailbox rule is applicable and the acceptance was effective when it was sent.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(D) Tommy cannot enforce Dad's promise on either contractual or promissory estoppel grounds. An enforceable contract does not exist because there was no consideration for Dad's promise to send $\$ 1,000$. Tommy, the promisee, incurred no legal detriment by either refraining from doing something that he had a legal right to do or doing something that he had no legal obligation to do, with such detriment being part of a bargained-for exchange with Dad. However, consideration is not necessary if the promisor should be estopped from not performing. A promise is enforceable to the extent necessary to prevent injustice if: (i) the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance; (ii) of a definite and substantial character; and (iii) such action or forbearance is induced. Dad had previously sent Tommy money for his expenses, and promised to send him the money here at issue for the same purpose. Due to Dad's express disapproval of Gidget, Dad certainly did not promise to send the money expecting to induce Tommy to buy Gidget a ring. Dad cannot be estopped from refusing to perform a promise where the result would be to require him to pay for something that he not only was unaware would happen but also of which he expressly disapproved. Thus, Dad's promise is not enforceable under a theory of promissory estoppel. (A) is incorrect because, although Tommy relied on Dad's promise in entering into the contract to purchase the ring, the promise was only made with the expectation of Tommy's incurring normal living expenses. Thus, Tommy was not justified in relying on the promise for the purpose that he did, and promissory estoppel does not apply. (B) is incorrect because the term "intended beneficiary" refers to a person not a party to a contract who is intended to have rights conferred by that contract. Here, there was no contract between Dad and someone else, pursuant to which Tommy became entitled to the money. (C) is not as good an answer as (D). It is true that Dad's promise was a gift unsupported by consideration. However, if circumstances existed justifying the application of promissory estoppel, the promise would be enforceable even in the absence of consideration. Therefore, (C) is not as precise as (D). 

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(C) The court should rule that there was sufficient consideration in Ellen's promise since her agreement to use her best efforts to sell and promote Calvin's gowns will be implied. For a contract to be valid, consideration must exist on both sides; i.e., promises must be mutually obligatory. Here, Calvin has agreed to make Ellen his exclusive retail distributor, but Ellen's promise is less apparent-what is she obliged to do? The facts do not show any specific obligation. However, in a case where someone is to be the exclusive distributor, the court will imply a promise to use best efforts to sell the product. This implied promise is valid consideration both under the common law and the Uniform Commercial Code (applicable here because goods are involved). Thus, the contract between Ellen and Calvin includes an implied promise that Ellen will use her best efforts to promote and sell Calvin's gowns, and such a promise is valid consideration. (A) is wrong because merely placing an order for gowns would not cure the defect in the April 1 contract absent Ellen's implied promise, because Ellen still will not have promised to do anything under that contract (i.e., she is not bound to do anything referable to the April 1 contract); rather, all she has promised to do is to pay for the goods that she ordered, which is sufficient consideration only for the May 1 order, not for the entire contract. (B) is wrong because a merchant's firm offer must contain words promising to keep the offer open for a period of time, and here the contract explicitly states that it may be canceled at any time. (D) is wrong because as in (A), Calvin's act here is not necessarily referable to the April 1 contract; rather, it is important only as to the May 1 order; it does not settle the issue of whether there was an enforceable April 1 contract.

\section{CRIMINAL LAW ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(A) Dorothy is liable both for the attempted murder of Melissa and, under the doctrine of transferred intent, for the murder of Hank. To be guilty of murder, one must unlawfully kill another human being with malice aforethought, which is a term of art encompassing various states of mind, including intent to kill, and the absence of facts excusing the homicide or reducing it to voluntary manslaughter. Here, Dorothy had the intent to kill Melissa. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, this intent is transferred from Melissa to Hank, the actual victim of the murder. There are no facts here excusing the homicide or reducing it to voluntary manslaughter on the basis of adequate provocation. Modern courts might allow a jury to consider whether discovery of the love letters would arouse the intense passion required for the first element of the provocation test; however, the third element, an absence of sufficient time between the provocation and the killing for the passions of a reasonable person to have cooled, is disproved by the facts of the question. The act of killing, although done by Sammy, is attributable to Dorothy as the principal because she caused an innocent intermediary (Sammy) to accomplish the result. Hence, Dorothy is liable for the murder of Hank; (C) is therefore incorrect. At common law, the crime of attempted murder required both a specific intent by the actor to kill the victim and an act that puts the defendant in close proximity to completing the crime. The Model Penal Code and most state criminal codes modify the "proximity" test for the act requirement, instead requiring an act that constitutes a "substantial step" towards commission of the crime. Here, Dorothy had the intent to kill Melissa and intentionally gave the loaded gun to Sammy with instructions to point it at Melissa and pull the trigger. Under either of the tests used, her conduct satisfies the act requirement of attempt. Thus, Dorothy is also liable for the attempted murder of Melissa; (B) is therefore incorrect. (D) is incorrect because the same act and intent can constitute both an attempt as to one person and a completed crime as to another person. Although, if Sammy's aim had been better, Dorothy could not have been convicted of both attempted murder of Melissa and murder of Melissa, the attempt against Melissa and the murder of Hank are separate crimes because more than one victim is involved.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(A) Howard can be convicted of murder. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, which may be (i) intent to kill, (ii) intent to inflict great bodily injury, (iii) reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life, or (iv) intent to commit a felony. Intentional use of a deadly weapon authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill. Here, Howard uttered statements of revenge, confronted Nick with a loaded gun, and intentionally shot him when he pulled out a knife-more than enough evidence for a jury to find that Howard had the malice aforethought necessary for murder. Furthermore, none of the issues raised in the other choices will suffice to excuse the killing or reduce it to voluntary manslaughter. (B) is wrong because Howard will not be able to meet all four tests for establishing the provocation necessary to reduce a killing from murder to voluntary manslaughter. Howard would have to offer evidence that (i) a provocation existed that would arouse sudden and intense passion in the mind of an ordinary person such as to cause him to lose his self-control, (ii) Howard was in fact provoked and lost his self-control, (iii) there was not sufficient time between the provocation and the killing for the passions of a reasonable person to cool, and (iv) Howard in fact did not cool off between the provocation and the killing. Howard can easily establish the first two elements, because discovery of one's spouse in bed with another person is virtually always considered adequate provocation by common law courts. However, the time interval between the provocation and the killing was probably sufficient for a reasonable person to cool off, and the facts 100. CRIMINAL LAW

strongly suggest that Howard did in fact cool off-.he consumed several drinks to build up his nerve before setting off for Nick's house, and he did not shoot Nick immediately when he confronted him. Thus, a jury would probably reject a claim of voluntary manslaughter here. (C) is incorrect because Howard's voluntary intoxication would not preclude a finding of intent for murder. Because Howard became intoxicated to build up his nerve to kill Nick, a court would probably find that his intent at the time he began drinking would apply to his later conduct. Furthermore, voluntary intoxication is no defense to crimes involving recklessness. Howard can still be liable for murder based on a state of mind of reckless indifference to human life-his conduct in becoming intoxicated and then confronting Nick with a loaded gun is sufficient to establish that state of mind. (D) is incorrect because the homicide will not be excused on selfdefense grounds. A person may use deadly force in self-defense only if (i) he is without fault, (ii) he is confronted with unlawful force, and (iii) he is threatened with imminent death or great bodily harm. Howard is not without fault, however, because he initiated the assault and prompted Nick to pull the knife. His status as the aggressor deprives him of the right to use force in his own defense under these circumstances.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(B) The court should affirm Larry's conviction. Crimes imposing a mens rea of malice generally do not require the proof of intent that specific intent crimes require. It is sufficient if the defendant recklessly disregarded an obvious or high risk that the particular harmful result would occur. Here, the facts presented were sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that Larry knew of the probability that the ladder would collapse without the braces when someone climbed down it, and acted in reckless disregard of that risk by removing the braces. (A) is incorrect because the fact that Larry was committing larceny when he removed the braces does not establish malice for purposes of the malicious injury charge. Even if his conduct were otherwise legal, he could be liable for that charge if he acted with reckless disregard of the high risk of injury. (C) is wrong because, as discussed above, it is generally not necessary to show an intent to injure for a crime requiring a mens rea of malice; reckless disregard of an obvious risk will usually suffice. (D) is incorrect because crimes requiring a mens rea of malice do not refer to malice in the dictionary sense; a showing of ill will or hatred of the victim is not required.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(A) Dana can be convicted of first degree murder for Victor's death. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. In the absence of facts excusing the homicide or reducing it to voluntary manslaughter, malice aforethought exists if the defendant has (i) intent to kill, (ii) intent to inflict great bodily injury, (iii) awareness of an unjustifiably high risk to human life, or (iv) intent to commit a felony (felony murder doctrine). In this case Dana clearly had the intent to kill Victor; her motive for doing so is irrelevant for establishing malice aforethought. It is also quite possible under the facts that Dana acted with premeditation and deliberation, making her potentially liable for first degree murder. "Deliberate" means that the defendant reflected on the crime in a cool and dispassionate manner. "Premeditated" means that such reflection actually was undertaken, but it need only be for a very brief period. Here, Dana could have reflected on the crime before she visited the hospital; the fact that she had a gun in her purse is circumstantial evidence of such reflection. Even if she did not make the decision to kill until moments before she pulled out the gun, she would still have been capable of premeditation and deliberation. (B) is therefore incorrect because it is not the most serious crime of which Dana can be convicted. (C) is incorrect because of the absence of facts establishing adequate provocation that would reduce an intentional killing from murder to voluntary manslaughter. Adequate provocation is most frequently recognized in cases of (i) being subjected to a serious battery or threat of deadly force, and (ii) discovering one's spouse in bed with another person. While modern courts have broadened somewhat the scope of what constitutes provocation, the law does not presently recognize feelings of mercy toward the victim as an adequate provocation. Thus, Dana can be convicted of murder for Victor's death. (This question is a good illustration of why you must always treat the defendant objectively in your analysis of Criminal Law questions.)

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(C) The fact that Andt was seeking to retrieve swim fins that belonged to him negates the requirement in burglary of entry with intent to commit a felony. At common law, a burglary is defined as a breaking and entry of the dwelling of another at nighttime with the intent of committing a felony therein. If Andt entered into the cabin believing that the swim fins were his and intending only to retrieve them, he did not enter with intent to commit a felony, since it is not a felony to recover your own property. (A) is incorrect because if the other elements of burglary were present, the fact that Andt did nothing in the cabin would be immaterial; the burglary would have been committed the moment he entered the cabin with the requisite intent. (B) is wrong for a similar reason. The fact that he did not commit a felony does not negate the prima facie case for burglary. (D) is wrong because the requirement of a breaking is satisfied as long as some degree of force is used to gain entry. Opening a closed door is sufficient for this element; there is no requirement that the door be locked.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(C) Kuegler's conduct satisfies the mens rea of "malice" required for arson. At common law, arson was defined as the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. The mens rea required for arson is malice, which is broader than the intent required for specific intent crimes and has nothing to do with ill will or evil motive. The defendant need not have intended to burn down the building; it is sufficient if he intended a burning that creates an obvious fire hazard to the building. Here, Kuegler knew that the store had an automatic sprinkler system, and he was not motivated by an intent to burn down the building. Nevertheless, he intended to start a fire with reckless disregard of a high risk that it would cause damage to the building. The risk or hazard is not that the building will burn down, merely that damage to the structure from a burning will occur. The "burning" required for arson does not require significant damage to the building; a charring of the combustible material is sufficient. Here, the wall next to the barrel was charred. This satisfies the "burning" requirement. The common law requirement that the structure be a dwelling has been broadened by the statute in this question to include other buildings. Thus, Kuegler's conduct satisfies all of the elements of the crime of arson. (A) is incorrect because the mens rea for arson can be satisfied even in the absence of a specific intent to burn the building. He acted with the requisite intent-malice-by intentionally starting a fire that created a high risk that a burning of the structure would occur. (B) is incorrect because, as discussed above, all of the elements of the prima facie case for arson have been established; the charring of the wall next to the barrel satisfies the "burning" requirement. (D) is incorrect because there is no "felony arson" rule like the felony murder rule. It has no bearing on the prima facie case for arson that he started the fire while perpetrating another felony.

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(C) As indicated in the question above, Kuegler is guilty of the crime of arson. He is also guilty of attempted larceny. Common law larceny requires a taking and carrying away of the personal property of another by trespass with intent to permanently deprive the other of his interest in the 

\section{CRIMINAL LAW}

property. Here, Kuegler planned to take and carry away watches in the store's possession by trespass (i.e., without permission) and with the intent to permanently deprive the store of them. However, he cannot be convicted of a completed larceny because he never actually took the watches. (A) and (B) are therefore incorrect. At common law, the crime of attempted larceny required both a specific intent by the actor to commit a larceny and an act that put the defendant in close proximity to completing the crime. The Model Penal Code and most state criminal codes modify the "proximity" test for the act requirement, instead requiring an act that constitutes a "substantial step" towards commission of the crime. Here, Kuegler intended to do what he did in order to commit a larceny for which he had the requisite intent. Also, he was apprehended after he set a fire to distract the store security guards and while he was smashing the glass on the watch case. Together, these acts satisfy the act requirement for attempt liability regardless of which test is employed. Thus, Kuegler is liable for attempted larceny and arson, making choice (C) correct and choice (D) incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(B) Dewey is least likely to be found guilty of an attempt crime because the act he committed is not a crime in the jurisdiction. The general rule is that a defendant cannot avoid liability for attempt on the basis that it would have been impossible to commit the completed crime. It applies to cases where the defendant's mistaken belief about the facts (i.e., factual impossibility) or about the legal relationships or circumstances prevents him from completing the crime that he intended to commit. However, it is still necessary that the result desired or intended by the defendant constitute a crime. Even if he otherwise has the kind of culpability required for the completed crime, his objective must be proscribed by law. If those things the defendant does or intends to do would not actually be a crime, this is legal impossibility and a defense. The defendant will not be guilty of an attempt even though he firmly believed that his goal was criminal. The facts in (B) indicate that Dewey thought he was committing statutory rape, but in fact the conduct he engaged in, and intended to engage in, was not proscribed by law. Thus, his conduct does not constitute an attempt to commit statutory rape. (A) is incorrect because Don's mistake about the legal status of the goods he fenced does not constitute a defense to attempt. The jewelry in the fact pattern in (A) has lost its status as "stolen" jewelry because it is being forwarded to Don with the owners' permission; it is therefore impossible for him to be liable for the completed crime of receipt of stolen goods. However, Don is guilty of attempted receipt of stolen goods because the legal status of the goods, unlike the existence or nonexistence of a law proscribing the conduct, is one of the attendant circumstances; this is treated like factual impossibility by most courts. By accepting the goods he believes to be stolen, Don has purposely engaged in conduct that would constitute receipt of stolen goods if the circumstances were as he believed them to be; hence, he is liable for attempted receipt of stolen goods. (C) is incorrect because Doreen has intentionally engaged in conduct that constitutes an attempt to conduct an illegal demonstration. The issue in this situation is mistake of law rather than impossibility. The general rule is that it is no defense to a crime that the defendant mistakenly believed that her acts were not prohibited by law. This is true even if her mistake was reasonable or was based upon advice of private counsel. Nor will mistake of law negate intent unless the mental state for a crime requires a certain belief concerning a collateral aspect of law, which is not the case here. There is no indication that the statute prohibiting illegal demonstrations requires knowledge that the demonstration is illegal. Had Doreen actually begun demonstrating in the building, she would have been liable for the completed crime simply because she had the intent to conduct the demonstration. Doreen is liable under the state's attempt statute because, acting with the intent to conduct a demonstration that would be illegal, she purposely attempted to bring her picket sign into the capitol building; this constituted an act in close proximity to completion of the crime. (D) is incorrect because Drew cannot defend on the ground that the completed crime was factually impossible to commit. The crime of theft by false pretenses requires that the defendant obtain title to the property of another by an intentional false statement of past or existing fact. This indicates that the false statement must be the cause of the victim passing title to the defendant (i.e., the victim must rely on the statement). Because Hartigan was just disguising himself as a homeowner as part of the sting operation, it would have been impossible for Drew to commit the completed offense. However, Drew had the intent to commit the crime and purposely did everything necessary to complete the crime had the facts been as he believed them to be. As a result, Drew is liable for attempted theft by false pretenses.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(D) Jeffries could not be convicted of any of the listed combinations of crimes. (A) is incorrect because Jeffries did not have the mental state required to be an accomplice for attempted false pretenses. To be convicted as an accomplice under the prevailing common law rule, a person generally must have given aid, counsel, or encouragement with the intent to aid or encourage the principal in the commission of the crime charged. Under certain circumstances, knowledge that the crime will result from the aid provided will suffice for accomplice liability, but here Jeffries did not even know of Garth's plan to commit false pretenses. Thus, while Jeffries aided Garth's attempted false pretenses by procuring Mrs. Wealthy's key, he did not have the mental state to be liable as an accomplice for that crime. (B) is incorrect because the parties did not intend to achieve the same objective when they agreed to the theft of the key. Conspiracy requires three elements: (i) an agreement between two or more persons, (ii) an intent to enter into an agreement (which is often inferred from the act of agreement), and (iii) an intent to achieve the objective of the agreement. To establish the third element, a minimum of two persons must intend to achieve the same purpose; i.e., there must be a "meeting of guilty minds." Here, the only objective that Jeffries and Garth intended and agreed to achieve was the theft of the key. The parties neither expressly nor impliedly agreed to commit a burglary, and the fact that Garth used the key for a different purpose than Jeffries anticipated indicates that there was no "meeting of guilty minds." (C) is incorrect. As explained above, Jeffries did not conspire to commit burglary. The same analysis applies to the charge of conspiracy to commit false pretenses. There was no agreement between Jeffries and Garth as to that crime. Not only did Jeffries not intend to bring about the crime of false pretenses, he did not even have knowledge that he was facilitating that crime by supplying the key. The third crime in choice (C), larceny, presents a closer question. As discussed above, under certain circumstances, a party may be liable as an accomplice by giving aid with knowledge that the crime will result from the aid provided. While the sale of ordinary goods at ordinary prices knowing they will be used in a crime will not suffice, procuring an illegal item or selling at a higher price because of the buyer's purpose may constitute a sufficient "stake in the venture" for a court to find intent to aid. Here, if Garth had intended to use the key to commit larceny and Jeffries knew this, his theft of the key might suffice for accomplice liability. However, Jeffries did not "know" that Garth was going to use the key to commit larceny because Garth was not going to do so. The fact that Garth later decided to commit larceny is probably not adequate for Jeffries to be liable as an accomplice. In any event, the combination of larceny, conspiracy to commit burglary, and conspiracy to commit false pretenses is clearly incorrect. Thus, by a process of elimination, (D) is the correct answer.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(A) The only additional common law crime that Garth could be convicted of is larceny. Common law larceny consists of (i) a taking (ii) and carrying away (iii) of tangible personal property 

\section{CRIMINAL LAW}

(iv) of another (v) by trespass (vi) with intent to permanently (or for an unreasonable time) deprive the person of an interest in the property. Garth has committed larceny of the statuette because he took it from Mrs. Wealthy's apartment by trespass (i.e., wrongfully) with the intent to permanently deprive her of it. (B) and (C) are incorrect because Garth has not committed burglary. The elements of burglary at common law are (i) a breaking (ii) and entry (iii) of the dwelling (iv) of another (v) at nighttime (vi) with the intent to commit a felony therein. While Garth had gained entry to Mrs. Wealthy's apartment with the intent to commit the felony of false pretenses, whether he committed a "breaking" is debatable. At common law, a breaking can be constructive if the defendant gains entry by means of fraud, threat, or intimidation. The fraud, however, is typically a misrepresentation of identity to trick the occupant into opening the door of the dwelling. Here, while Garth misrepresented how he had obtained the key, Mrs. Wealthy invited him in as a gesture of thanks; i.e., she was not tricked into opening her door to let him in. Even if Garth's conduct were sufficient for a constructive breaking, it also fails to satisfy the nighttime element. His entry into Mrs. Wealthy's apartment during the afternoon would not suffice for burglary at common law. (D) is incorrect because, as discussed in the answer to the previous question, there was no express or implied agreement between Garth and Jeffries to commit a burglary; hence, Garth cannot be liable for conspiracy to commit burglary.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(A) If the jury believes Bulky's testimony, he did not have the intent for robbery. A robbery consists of (i) a taking (ii) of personal property of another, (iii) from the other's person or presence, (iv) by force or intimidation, (v) with the intent to permanently deprive him of it. Thus, robbery is basically an aggravated form of larceny in which the taking is accomplished by force or threats of force. If the jury believes Bulky's testimony that he was only trying to beg some bus money, his only intent was to accept money that Juan voluntarily gave him. Bulky did not have an intent to permanently deprive Juan of his interest in the property because Bulky believed that Juan was freely transferring his interest to Bulky. Thus, the jury should find him not guilty of robbery. (B) is incorrect because the defendant's intent, rather than the effect of his conduct, is the controlling factor. Without any other facts, Bulky's conduct was sufficiently intimidating that a jury could conclude that he had an intent to rob. If the jury believes Bulky's testimony, however, it should find that he did not have the intent necessary for robbery. (C) is incorrect because Bulky's testimony, if believed, would also negate the intent necessary for assault. Criminal assault is either (i) an attempt to commit a battery, or (ii) the intentional creation of a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the victim of imminent bodily harm. If Bulky had intended to create an apprehension of imminent bodily harm, he would be liable for robbery because he would have been using that apprehension to permanently deprive Juan of his property. However, assuming that Bulky was just trying to beg rather than rob, he will not be found to have intended to create the apprehension that he did. (D) is incorrect not only because Bulky's testimony disproves the requisite intent of either offense, but also because the assault would be a lesser included offense of the robbery under these circumstances. A lesser included offense is one that consists entirely of some (but not all) of the elements of the greater crime. Under the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy, lesser included offenses "merge" into the greater offenses, in the sense that one may not be convicted of both the greater offense and a lesser included offense. Here, the robbery would be by intimidation: conduct by Bulky that was intended to create apprehension of imminent bodily harm in Juan's mind. This element of the robbery offense would be enough to establish liability for assault as well, but robbery has additional elements; hence, Bulky could not have been found guilty of both robbery and the lesser included offense of assault. 

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(D) Doofus's waiver of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination after receiving Miranda warnings applies to the subsequent questioning about another crime. Miranda $v$. Arizona (1966) requires that a person in custody be informed of his right to remain silent and his right to the presence of an attorney during questioning. A suspect may then waive his Miranda rights by answering an interrogator's questions as long as the waiver was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The suspect need not be informed of all potential subjects of an interrogation to effect a valid waiver. If the suspect has waived his rights, there is generally no need to repeat the warnings because of a break in the interrogation unless the time lapse has been so long that a failure to do so would seem like an attempt to take advantage of the suspect's ignorance of his rights. Here, Doofus was given his Miranda warnings and apparently made a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his rights by agreeing to answer Smith's questions. The one-hour break for lunch does not invalidate the waiver, nor does the fact that the subsequent questioning involved a different crime. Hence, Doofus probably will fail to prevent the confession from being admitted at his trial. (A) is incorrect. If Doofus had asserted his Miranda rights during the initial questioning, any subsequent interrogation about a different crime would be invalid without a significant time lapse and a fresh set of warnings. However, because Doofus waived his Miranda rights during the initial interrogation, subsequent interrogation about a different crime does not require repetition of the warnings; the waiver applies to all potential subjects of an interrogation. (B) is incorrect because the custodial setting requires only that the police give defendant the Miranda warnings at the outset, which they did. The valid waiver that followed permits admissibility of the confession. (C) is incorrect because it is irrelevant what charge Doofus was in custody for. Unlike the offense-specific Sixth Amendment right to counsel, a detainee's rights under Miranda are not offense specific. Doofus was in custody because he was not free to leave; thus, any interrogation must satisfy the requirements of Miranda. If the police had not given him Miranda warnings before he was questioned on the first charge or if he had not validly waived his rights, any questioning regarding the second charge would have been improper.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(D) The state's best argument is that, because Gordon was not a government agent, he need not have given Denise the Miranda warnings. As a means of protecting the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination, a person must be informed prior to custodial interrogation that: (i) she has the right to remain silent; (ii) anything she says can be used against her in court; (iii) she has the right to the presence of an attorney; and (iv) if she cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for her if she so desires. These Miranda warnings must be given only if the detainee is being questioned by someone known to be working for the police. Here, Gordon is a private security guard employed by a private business (the grocery store). Thus, since Gordon was not required to inform Denise of the Miranda warnings, he could not possibly have violated Denise's Miranda rights. (A), (B), and (C) all reflect matters that would come into play only if Gordon were a government agent. However, they would also be incorrect even if Gordon were a government agent. (A) is incorrect because Gordon's statement might be deemed to be interrogatory. "Interrogation" refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police that they should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. Although it is not an express question to say "You're too young to be a thief," such words are reasonably likely to bring forth some sort of incriminating response. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that Gordon's statement was not interrogatory. (B) is incorrect because, in a delinquency proceeding, a juvenile must be afforded the right not to testify, including all aspects of the privilege against self-incrimination. Miranda warnings are a very important 

\section{CRIMINAL LAW}

aspect of the privilege against self-incrimination. In addition, a juvenile court may determine that a child should be transferred to adult court for trial as an adult on criminal charges. Certainly, in such an instance, the requirement of Miranda warnings would be applicable. Consequently, regardless of whether a child is treated by the courts as a juvenile or an adult, it is incorrect to state that giving the Miranda warnings to juveniles is discretionary. (C) is incorrect because an actual arrest and formal charges are not a prerequisite to triggering the need for Miranda warnings. All that is required is that an interrogation be custodial in nature. An interrogation is considered custodial if the individual is not free to leave. Gordon grabbed Denise by the arm before making his statement. Thus, it could be argued that what followed was custodial interrogation, because Denise was not free to leave.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(C) The cocaine is inadmissible because it is the product of an unconstitutional search of Nick. The Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures applies to an investigatory detention and any type of search during the detention. Under Terry $v$. Ohio (1968), police have the authority to briefly detain a person for investigative purposes, even if they lack probable cause to arrest, as long as they have an articulable and reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. However, an investigatory detention does not create the right to search the person being detained. The officer may conduct a protective frisk (a patdown of the outer clothing) only if he reasonably believes that the person may be armed and presently dangerous. A full search of the person is only permitted if the detention establishes probable cause for a lawful arrest. In this case, Sam may have had sufficient grounds to detain Mike and Nick to ask them questions. Whether police have a reasonable suspicion-supported by articulable facts-of criminal activity is judged by the totality of the circumstances. [United States v. Sokolow (1989)] Here, the conduct of Mike and Nick may have made Sam reasonably suspicious that they were smuggling drugs. However, after finding nothing in his search of their luggage, and having no reason to believe that they were armed and presently dangerous, Sam had neither probable cause nor reasonable suspicion to either search or frisk Mike and Nick. Hence, under the exclusionary rule, the cocaine obtained as a result of the unlawful search of Nick is inadmissible against him. (A) is incorrect because there is no general emergency exception justifying searches without probable cause, and the search at issue here had none of the exigent circumstances that the Supreme Court has relied on in prior cases to permit warrantless searches (such as the hot pursuit of a fleeing felon or the evanescent nature of the evidence). (B) is incorrect because the scope of a search permitted by consent is limited by the scope of the consent. Nick's consent to the search of his luggage created no implication of a consent to a body search. (D) is incorrect because Sam had Mike and Nick's consent to search their luggage. Police may conduct a valid and warrantless search if they have a voluntary and intelligent consent to do so from the individual being searched; Mike and Nick's consent here satisfies these requirements.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(D) Because Mike's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by the unlawful search of Nick, the cocaine may be introduced against Mike at trial. Under Rakas v. Illinois (1978), Fourth Amendment rights may be enforced by the exclusion of evidence only at the instance of one whose own protection was infringed by the search and seizure. Ownership of the property seized does not automatically establish violation of one's reasonable expectation of privacy; it is just one factor in the totality of the circumstances that the court will consider. [Rawlings v. Kentucky (1980)] Here, the cocaine was seized from Nick as a result of a search that violated his Fourth Amendment rights. However, nothing in the question indicates that Mike had a legitimate expectation of privacy in Nick's body (such as the right to exclude others from searching Nick if Nick had consented). Under the circumstances in this case, Mike's ownership of the cocaine does not establish a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to the search of Nick. (A) is incorrect because the fact that Mike did not have actual possession of the cocaine does not require that the cocaine be excluded from his trial. He may be liable under the jurisdiction's possession statute if he had sufficient dominion or control over the cocaine to be in constructive possession of it. (B) is incorrect even though it is a true statement. Sam's search of Mike violated Mike's reasonable expectation of privacy, but no evidence was obtained by the illegal search of Mike. Sam's search of Nick violated Nick's reasonable expectation of privacy but not Mike's expectation of privacy (as discussed above). Because Mike's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by the search of Nick, he cannot use the exclusionary rule to suppress introduction of the cocaine. (C) is incorrect because the defendant has the right to testify and stipulate to facts at a preliminary hearing on a motion to suppress the evidence without his testimony or stipulation being admitted against him at trial on the issue of guilt. [Simmons v. United States (1968)] This rule allows a defendant to assert a possessory or ownership interest in illegally seized evidence just for purposes of invoking the exclusionary rule; if he fails to have the evidence excluded, he may still deny possession or ownership at trial.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(D) Statement III. offers Simpson the only basis for vacating his guilty plea and sentence. In accordance with the contractual view of plea bargains, a defendant who agrees to a plea bargain has the right to have that bargain kept. If the prosecution does not keep the bargain, the court will decide whether the circumstances require specific performance of the plea agreement or whether the defendant should be granted an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. Here, Simpson agreed to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for the recommendation of probation. His co-defendants' decision to plead guilty rather than go to trial may have been influenced by the fact that Simpson had agreed to testify; hence, the fact that he did not testify at their trial does not allow the prosecution to avoid the terms of the plea bargain. (A) and (B) are wrong because the fact that the prosecution threatened to bring additional charges, as indicated in Statement I., is not a basis for claiming that a guilty plea was involuntary as long as there was some legal basis for bringing the additional charges. Consistent with the contract theory of plea negotiation, the State has the power to drive a hard bargain in reaching a plea agreement. (B) and (C) are wrong because Simpson's claim of innocence does not prevent the court from accepting his guilty plea, contrary to Statement II. Before accepting a guilty plea, the court must find that the plea was voluntary and intelligent. However, admission of guilt is not a constitutional requisite to imposition of a criminal penalty. When a defendant pleads guilty despite protesting his innocence, the plea may still be seen as an intelligent choice by the defendant, and withdrawal of the plea will not be permitted when there is other strong evidence of guilt in the record. Here, Simpson weighed the risks and benefits before pleading guilty, and the statements by his co-defendants provide other evidence of his guilt; thus, his claim of innocence is not a basis for attacking his guilty plea.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(D) The state's best argument is that Chaven procured dismissal of the original trial on a technicality. The Fifth Amendment right to be free of double jeopardy for the same offense generally requires that, once jeopardy attaches in the first prosecution, the defendant may not be retried for the same offense. Under certain circumstances, however, a defendant can be retried even if jeopardy has 

\section{CRIMINAL LAW}

attached. One such circumstance is that a trial may be discontinued and the defendant reprosecuted for the same offense when the termination occurs at the behest of the defendant on any grounds not constituting an acquittal on the merits. Double jeopardy does not bar two trials, but only a retrial after a determination on the merits. Here, the municipal charge against Chaven was dismissed, and the trial terminated, at the request of Chaven on the basis of a technical error in the information. This was not an acquittal on the merits. Thus, there is no violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy presented by the current state prosecution of Chaven. Regarding (A), it is true that the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy does not apply to trials by separate sovereigns. A person may be tried for the same conduct by both a state and the federal government, or by two states. However, a state and its municipalities are not deemed to be separate sovereigns. Thus, Chaven may not be tried for the same conduct by the city of Briggs and the state of Riverfront. (B) is incorrect. The fact that the state charge requires proof of a fact not required by the municipal charge does not satisfy the test for determining that the "same offense" is not involved for purposes of double jeopardy. At best, it indicates only that the municipal charge is a lesser included offense of the state charge. A lesser included offense is one that consists entirely of some, but not all, elements of a greater crime. Attachment of jeopardy for a lesser included offense usually bars retrial for the greater offense. Here, the municipal charge consists entirely of all the elements of the state charge, except for the element of intent to distribute the illegal narcotics. Therefore, the municipal charge is a lesser included offense of the state charge. This fact would, if anything, provide an argument in support of the position that the trial in state court constitutes double jeopardy. Thus, (B) does not present an argument against granting the motion filed on behalf of Chaven. (C) is incorrect because it misstates the point at which jeopardy attaches. Jeopardy attaches in a jury trial at the impaneling and swearing of the jury, and in a bench trial when the first witness is sworn. This question deals with a jury trial, and we are told that the jury has been sworn, selected, and impaneled. Thus, jeopardy has attached, despite the fact that no witness has been sworn. 

\section{EVIDENCE ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(A) Father White's testimony as to Dassent's responsible nature is admissible as circumstantial evidence that he was not driving the hit-and-run vehicle. The accused in a criminal case can introduce evidence of his good character to show his innocence of the alleged crime. Federal Rule 405 allows the defendant to call a qualified witness to testify as to his personal opinion concerning a trait of the defendant that is involved in the case. In this case, whether Dassent was the driver of the hit-and-run vehicle is a critical issue in the case; thus, testimony that Dassent is a responsible person who would not leave the scene of an accident pertains to a relevant character trait. Father White, having known Dassent for 12 years, is qualified to give his personal opinion as to Dassent's character. The court should therefore permit White to testify. (B) is incorrect because Father White's testimony is character evidence rather than habit evidence. Both habit evidence and character evidence are admissible to show how a person probably acted on a particular occasion. However, habit evidence describes one's regular response to a specific set of circumstances, while character evidence describes one's disposition in respect to general traits. Here, there is no specific repeated situation that Dassent regularly responded to (such as regularly failing to stop at a certain stop sign). Rather, it is Dassent's general trait of responsibility that is being offered as evidence. (C) is incorrect because Father White's testimony is admissible as relevant character evidence. As a general rule, a party may not bolster the testimony of his witness until the witness has been impeached. Here, even though Father White's testimony bolsters Dassent's unimpeached testimony that he did not drive the hit-and-run vehicle, it is independently admissible as character evidence that supports Dassent's case. The fact that Dassent is testifying in his own defense when Father White is called to support him does not make Father White's testimony inadmissible. (D) is incorrect because it reverses the rule. In a criminal case, the defense does not need to have the prosecution put defendant's character in issue before the defense can rebut it; the defense can initiate evidence of the defendant's character. On the other hand, the prosecution cannot make an issue of defendant's character until the defendant has elected to put his character in issue.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(B) Testimony of Devlin's reputation as a violent person is admissible to rebut the defendant's character evidence. The general rule is that the prosecution cannot initiate evidence of the bad character of the defendant merely to show that he is more likely to have committed the crime of which he is accused. However, if the defendant puts his character in issue by having a character witness testify as to his opinion of the defendant, the prosecution may rebut with evidence of the defendant's bad character. One means of rebutting defendant's character evidence is by calling qualified witnesses to testify to the defendant's bad reputation for the particular trait involved in the case. Here, Devlin put his character in issue by having Westin testify to Devlin's nonviolent nature, which is relevant to whether he committed the crime charged. The prosecution, assuming that it can show that the police officer has knowledge of Devlin's reputation in the community, can have the officer testify that Devlin had a reputation as a violent person. (A) is incorrect because Westin's credibility cannot be attacked by extrinsic evidence of specific instances of misconduct. While any matter that tends to prove or disprove the credibility of a witness is relevant for purposes of impeachment, extrinsic evidence of the witness's bad acts is not permitted to attack the witness's character for truthfulness. Unless the misconduct was the basis for a criminal conviction, for which a record of the judgment may be offered, bad acts may only be inquired about during cross-examination. Thus, a neighbor's testimony of Westin's specific instances of misconduct would not be admissible. (C) is incorrect. While Devlin has "opened the 

\section{EVIDENCE}

door" to evidence of his bad character by presenting testimony of his good character, the evidence must pertain to the particular trait involved in the case. Here, the defendant's capacity for violence has been placed in issue by defendant, but his reputation for truthfulness is not relevant to whether he has committed the crime for which he is charged. (And because Devlin has not placed his credibility in issue by taking the stand as a witness, his reputation for truthfulness cannot be offered for impeachment purposes.) (D) is incorrect because the basic rule is that when a person is charged with one crime, extrinsic evidence of his other crimes or misconduct is inadmissible if offered solely to establish a criminal disposition, regardless of whether defendant has placed his character in issue. [Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)] While evidence of other crimes is admissible if it is independently relevant to some other issue (e.g., motive, intent, or identity), Devlin's battery conviction in this case appears to have no relevance other than as evidence of his violent disposition. It is therefore inadmissible.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(C) The testimony of Wally is character evidence; i.e., it describes Don's general behavior patterns. Evidence of character to prove the conduct of a person in the litigated event is generally not admissible in a civil case. Here, Perry is trying to employ the circumstantial use of prior behavior patterns to draw the inference that Don drove at an excessive rate of speed at the time of the incident here at issue. Such a use of character evidence is not permitted. (A) is incorrect because character is not in issue. An exception to the general prohibition of character evidence is that, when a person's character itself is one of the issues in the case, character evidence is admissible. Don's character as a driver is not in issue; rather, his actions at a specific time and place are in issue. Thus, this exception does not apply to these facts. Regarding (B), it is true that character may be established by reputation evidence under the Federal Rules. However, as explained above, this is not a proper case for the use of character evidence. Therefore, (B) is incorrect. (D) is also incorrect. While it is true that testimony as to a person's reputation in the community may in some sense be considered hearsay (i.e., such testimony reflects what people are saying about a person), reputation testimony is a permissible (and in fact, the most common) means of showing character. Thus, (D) does not present a basis for refusing to allow the testimony.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(A) The statement by Doug, who is one of the parties to the action, is admissible as an admission of a party-opponent. Federal Rule $801(\mathrm{~d})(2)$ provides that a statement offered against a party that is the party's own statement is not hearsay and therefore cannot be excluded by the rule against hearsay. Assuming that it is relevant and not barred by other rules, the statement is admissible. Here, Doug's statement is being offered against him at trial. It is relevant because it can be interpreted as a prior acknowledgment by Doug that he was not totally blameless in the accident, which is undoubtedly inconsistent with his contentions at trial. The statement does not violate Federal Rule 408, which makes offers to compromise a disputed claim inadmissible to prove liability for the claim, because it was made by Doug before Peter made any claim; i.e., there was not yet an actual dispute between the parties. Nor does the statement violate Rule 411 , which bars evidence that a person has liability insurance when offered to show fault or ability to pay, because Doug's reference to his insurance was an intrinsic part of his admission and could not be readily severed from it. No other rules barring relevant evidence apply, so the statement should be admitted. (B) is incorrect because the statement against interest exception to the hearsay rule [Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3)] requires the declarant to be unavailable as a witness, which is not indicated here. More importantly, whenever the statement being offered is by a party, it will almost always be admissible as an admission of a party-opponent even though it does not qualify as a statement against interest, because an admission has none of the restrictions that a statement against interest has. (C) is wrong because, as previously noted, Doug's statement was made before the existence of a disputed claim between the parties. The public policy rationale for Rule 408 , which is to encourage settlement of disputes without litigation, does not come into play until litigation is at least threatened. (D) is incorrect because the statement is an admission by a party, which is treated as nonhearsay under the Federal Rules.

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(D) The prosecutor's question was a proper means of impeaching Wendt's credibility. A witness may be impeached through cross-examination by evidence that he is biased or has an interest in the outcome of the case; i.e., evidence that shows that he has a motive to lie. Since Wendt has been indicted for the same armed robbery, it clearly helps his case for him to provide an alibi for both of them. Furthermore, if Wendt were to testify that he and Doobad committed the robbery, his testimony could be used against him at his own trial as an admission. Thus, Wendt has a motive to lie and may be impeached by being asked on cross-examination about the facts that show bias, as the prosecutor did here. (A) is incorrect because the prosecutor is impeaching Wendt on the basis of bias, not on the basis of poor character for truthfulness. For the latter basis of impeachment, Federal Rule 609 requires a criminal conviction rather than just an indictment (unless it was for a crime probative of truthfulness, such as perjury, which could be the subject of crossexamination under Rule 608(b) even if there has not yet been a conviction). Thus, Wendt could not be impeached by being asked about an indictment (and (A) would then be the correct choice) if Wendt had been under indictment for a robbery other than the same robbery for which Doobad is being tried (since it would not show a motive to lie for Doobad). (B) misstates the law. A witness may be impeached by interrogating him as to specific acts of misconduct that may affect his character and show him to be unworthy of belief. [See Fed. R. Evid. 608(b)] (C) is incorrect because evidence is never admissible to show a person's criminal propensities. For impeachment purposes, the prosecution wants to attack the witness's credibility rather than his criminal propensity. The indictment, as opposed to the crime charged in the indictment, generally shows nothing with respect to the witness's character for truthfulness. Thus, to impeach this witness on a ground other than bias, the prosecutor would ask about the robbery itself, not the indictment.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(C) The question is a proper means of impeaching Weiner's character for truthfulness through specific instances of misconduct. Under Federal Rule 608(b), subject to the discretion of the trial judge, a witness may be interrogated on cross-examination with respect to any specific act that may impeach his character and show him to be unworthy of belief, as long as the act is probative of truthfulness (i.e., an act of deceit or lying). A conviction of a crime is not necessary under this rule. Cheating on one's taxes is lying, so this would be a specific act of misconduct reflecting on Weiner's character for truthfulness. The objection should be overruled. (A) is incorrect. Any matter that tends to prove or disprove the credibility of a witness is relevant because it affects the weight that the trier of fact should give to his testimony. $(\mathrm{B})$ is incorrect because Weiner is not being impeached by collateral extrinsic evidence (which is not permitted by Rule 608(b)); he is only being interrogated on cross-examination. (D) is incorrect because it states a requirement for impeachment by a prior conviction under Federal Rule 609 , rather than by prior bad acts under Rule 608(b), which does not require that the conduct constitute a felony. Rule 609 is inapplicable because it requires a criminal conviction, and Weiner has never even been charged with tax evasion. 

\section{EVIDENCE}

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(C) Evidence of Dunbad's purchases of insurance on Victa's life shortly before her death is admissible because it has a tendency to make Dunbad's murder of Victa more probable than it would be without the evidence. As a general rule, all relevant evidence is admissible if offered in an unobjectionable form or manner, as is the case here. This evidence is relevant because it establishes a motive for the murder, and facts showing motive for doing an act are circumstantial evidence that the act was done. Because there are no other grounds for excluding the evidence, it should be admitted. (A) is incorrect because exclusion of evidence on the ground of prejudice is a matter within the trial judge's broad discretion, and Federal Rule 403 requires that the evidence's probative value be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice for it to be excluded. While all evidence is prejudicial to the adverse party, "unfair" prejudice refers to evidence that suggests a decision on an emotional or otherwise improper basis; evidence of the purchase of life insurance policies does not fall within this category. (B) is incorrect because it misapplies the rule excluding evidence of insurance. Federal Rule 411 excludes evidence of liability insurance on the issue of whether a person acted negligently or wrongfully. Evidence of insurance coverage (particularly where it is life insurance on the life of a homicide victim) is relevant and admissible for other purposes. (D) is incorrect for two reasons: First, the purchase of insurance does not establish a criminal disposition or a propensity to do criminal acts. Second, evidence of conduct offered to show criminal propensity is inadmissible character evidence under Federal Rule 404. Thus, if the evidence were offered to show criminal propensity, the objection should be sustained, not overruled. On the other hand, evidence of prior conduct (or misconduct) is specifically admissible under Rule 404(b) to show the defendant's motive, which is what the insurance evidence is intended to show.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(D) Birch's former testimony should be admissible. Under Federal Rule 804(b)(1), the testimony of a now unavailable witness given at another hearing under oath is admissible in a subsequent trial as long as there is a sufficient similarity of parties and issues so that the opportunity to develop testimony or cross-examine at the prior hearing was meaningful. In criminal cases, the accused or his attorney must have been present and have had the opportunity to cross-examine at the time the testimony was given. Here, Birch's testimony was given against Dogwood at a prosecution for the same conduct that constituted the felony murder offense for which Dogwood is now being prosecuted, and Dogwood had the same motive to challenge Birch's identification of him then as he does now. Hence, the testimony can be admitted under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule. (A) is wrong because it is not essential, even in criminal cases, that the trials be on the same charge. The exception is satisfied as long as the subject matter is sufficiently similar that the defendant had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the declarant's testimony at the prior hearing. (B) is incorrect because the Supreme Court has rejected a Confrontation Clause challenge to the use of former testimony. As long as the defendant had the opportunity to crossexamine at the prior hearing and the witness is truly unavailable, the testimony is admissible. (C) is incorrect because it refers to prior statements of identification by a witness at the present trial. This case involves the hearsay exception for former testimony, which requires that the witness now be unavailable.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(B) The question of the existence or nonexistence of preliminary facts other than those of conditional relevance is to be determined by the court. All preliminary fact questions involving the standards of trustworthiness of alleged exceptions to the hearsay rule are to be determined by the court. Thus, the court, not the jury, must decide whether a purported business record was made in the regular course of business. In the case at bar, the question to be decided is whether or not the "synopsis of sales" was in fact made during the regular course of business. Thus, this issue must be decided by the judge. During the hearing at which the judge makes the preliminary fact determination, both parties must be given an opportunity to present evidence with regard to the fact to be determined. Also, it is within the judge's discretion whether the jury should be excused during the preliminary fact determination. (B) is correct because it calls for the determination as to whether the document is a business record to be made by the judge, it allows for the presentation of evidence by both sides, and holding the hearing in the presence of the jury is within the judge's discretion. (A) is incorrect because it indicates that the hearing must be conducted outside the presence of the jury. (C) incorrectly calls for the jury to decide the issue. There is no question here of conditional relevance. The question is one of competency of the evidence. Therefore, this is not the type of preliminary fact to be decided by the jury. (D) also reaches the incorrect conclusion that the jury has the ultimate decision on this matter. Only the judge may decide whether the document in question qualifies as a business record. Once the decision has been made, this issue cannot be further pursued to the jury.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(D) Schrinkov should not be allowed to testify because Willie's credibility has not been impeached. Evidence of a witness's character is admissible only after the witness's character for truthfulness has been attacked. [Fed. R. Evid. 608(a)] Dr. Schrinkov's testimony would have been admissible if Willie's veracity had been attacked on cross-examination, but here the defense did not crossexamine Willie. (A) is incorrect because the rule for reinforcing a witness's veracity differs from the rule for challenging it. A party may put witnesses on the stand to bolster another witness's credibility only when the witness's credibility has been attacked. (B) is wrong because there is no indication that Willie's ability to testify is in issue or that his testimony may confuse the jury. Federal Rule 702 provides that expert testimony is admissible if the subject matter is one where scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge would assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence or determining a fact in issue, and Rule 703 permits an expert's opinion to be based on observations made at trial. However, evaluating the reliability of an eyewitness's identification is traditionally within the province of the jury. Since the court has determined that Willie is competent to testify, the jury has the ability to decide on its own what weight to give his testimony. $(\mathrm{C})$ is incorrect because it is too broad. While courts generally allow a jury to evaluate a witness's veracity on its own, expert testimony would be allowed if Willie's credibility had been attacked on cross-examination or by other witnesses on the ground that he was too young to testify truthfully. Since this is an area where an expert's specialized knowledge would help the jury in evaluating Willie's testimony, Dr. Schrinkov probably would have been allowed to testify.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(D) Lorca's comparison of the letters is not a proper basis for authenticating Wilson's letter. Before a writing may be received into evidence, the writing must be authenticated by proof showing that the writing is what the proponent claims it is. The Federal Rules list several examples of proper methods of authentication through evidence of the genuineness of the handwriting of a letter writer. None of them, however, would permit an in-court comparison by Lorca of the WilsonLorca letter with another letter established to be Wilson's. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 901(b), an expert witness or the trier of fact can determine the genuineness of a writing by comparing the questioned writing with another writing proved to be genuine. Thus, choice (C) 

\section{EVIDENCE}

would be a proper basis for admitting Wilson's letter, because the jury, as the trier of fact, can compare the Wilson-Lorca letter with another letter that Wilson has admitted writing. Lorca, however, cannot undertake that comparison because he is not an expert witness. While Rule 901 does not limit the methods of authentication, the rule governing opinion testimony by lay witnesses [Fed. R. Evid. 701] would preclude Lorca's in-court comparison. To be admissible, opinion testimony by lay witnesses must be (i) rationally based on the perception of the witness; (ii) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or to determination of a fact in issue; and (iii) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge. Here, Lorca can add nothing to the jury's determination of the authenticity of the letter because the jury can compare for itself that letter with a letter Wilson has admitted writing. Because Lorca's in-court comparison would not be helpful to the jury here, it would not be a proper basis for authenticating Wilson's letter. (A) is incorrect because a lay witness who has personal knowledge of the handwriting of the supposed writer may state her opinion as to whether the document is in that person's handwriting. Therefore, Wilson's wife could properly authenticate the letter by testifying that she recognizes his handwriting. (B) is incorrect because Lorca's testimony is proper circumstantial evidence of authentication under the reply letter doctrine. Under this doctrine, a letter may be authenticated by evidence that it was written in response to a communication sent to the claimed author. The content of the letter must make it unlikely that it was written by anyone other than the claimed author of the writing. Here, Wilson's letter to Lorca can be properly authenticated by Lorca's testimony that it was a reply to a letter that he sent to Wilson.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(B) Warren's testimony is admissible under the present state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. Under Rule 803(3), a statement of a declarant's then-existing state of mind is admissible as circumstantial evidence tending to show that the intent was carried out. [See Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hillmon (1892)] Here, Vanessa's statement to Warren is being offered to show that she probably went to the store where Trent was working that night, which is a material issue in the case. (A) is incorrect because the hearsay exception for present sense impressions applies to statements describing or explaining an event made while the declarant was perceiving the event, or immediately thereafter. Here, Vanessa's statement concerned her intent to do something, not an event that she was perceiving. (C) is incorrect because the hearsay exception for present state of mind does not require that the declarant be unavailable to testify. Unavailability is only required for (i) former testimony, (ii) statements against interest, (iii) dying declarations, and (iv) statements of personal and family history. (D) is wrong because Vanessa's statement is admissible under the state of mind exception even though her state of mind is not directly in issue. Her state of mind or intent needs to be established before the inference can be drawn that she acted on that intent by going to see Trent.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(B) Phil's testimony is admissible as a statement of past physical condition. As an exception to the hearsay rule, the Federal Rules admit statements of past physical condition if made to medical personnel to assist in diagnosing or treating the condition. [Fed. R. Evid. 803(4)] Here, proper treatment by Phil of Violet's injuries required disclosure of the nature and duration of such injuries. Thus, Violet's statement as to having been beaten, and the time span involving the beatings, is pertinent to her diagnosis and treatment. Rule 803(4) also allows statements of the cause or source of the conditions insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment. In cases of domestic child abuse, courts have held that the identity of the attacker is pertinent for purposes of physical and psychological treatment. Here, Violet's statement that her mother's livein boyfriend was her assailant would qualify under this rule. Consequently, Phil's testimony as to Violet's statement is admissible under this exception to the hearsay rule. (A) is incorrect because the federal courts do not recognize any physician-patient privilege unless they are applying the law of a state recognizing the privilege, and here Darryl is being sued under a federal statute. Hence, no one would have to waive the privilege for Phil to testify. (C) is incorrect because, as explained above, statements as to the cause of a condition, including the identity of the assailant under the circumstances in this case, are admissible under this hearsay exception. (D) is incorrect. Unlike the hearsay exception for statements of family history, the exception for statements of past physical condition does not require that the declarant be unavailable.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(B) Julio's testimony is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted and is thus inadmissible hearsay. Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. [Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)] Julio is attempting to testify to an out-of-court statement made by himself. This statement is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement (that the tanks overheated), because Julio is seeking to prove that overheating of the tanks caused the fire. Therefore, the statement comes within the definition of hearsay. Because no exception to the hearsay rule is applicable, testimony as to the statement is not admissible. It is true, as (C) states, that Julio's testimony is evidence of a fact in issue. However, $(\mathrm{C})$ is incorrect because such evidence, as hearsay, is inadmissible. While Julio can testify as to his present recollection that the tanks overheated, he cannot use a prior out-of-court statement on that issue because the adverse party cannot effectively cross-examine the witness-declarant as to perception, memory, etc., at the time the statement was made. This is the main reason for the rule excluding hearsay. (A) is incorrect because a lack of other evidence about overheating of the tanks would not render admissible this otherwise inadmissible evidence. (D) is incorrect because Julio's testimony is offered to prove its truth, not as a verbal act. When an out-of-court statement is introduced for any purpose other than to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement, the statement is not hearsay. An example of such a statement is a verbal act (or legally operative fact), which is an utterance to which the law attaches legal significance. Evidence of such a statement is not hearsay because the issue is whether or not the statement was made. For instance, in an action on a contract, words that constitute the offer or acceptance are not hearsay, because they are offered only to prove what was said, and not that it was true. Here, Julio's out-of-court statement is not being offered simply to prove that it was made. Rather, the statement is offered to prove that its contents are true; i.e., that the tanks overheated. Thus, the testimony is not evidence of a verbal act.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(A) Frogman's testimony should be admissible because it is relevant nonhearsay based on firsthand knowledge. The testimony is relevant to Gray's age discrimination suit because it is being offered to prove that the Board's motivation in firing Gray was his age. It is not hearsay, even though Frogman is repeating the statement of an out-of-court declarant (Cobb), because it is not being offered to prove the truth of what Cobb was asserting (i.e., that Gray was in fact too old to fit the corporate image). Rather, it is being offered to show its effect on the Board; i.e., it is being offered as circumstantial evidence of the Board's motivation in deciding to fire Gray, which is the critical issue in the case. Finally, Frogman is competent to testify to Cobb's statement since he heard it firsthand, and no other restrictions on the admissibility of relevant evidence are applicable in this case. (B) is incorrect because, as discussed above, the testimony as to Cobb's statement is not hearsay because it is not being offered to prove the truth of that statement. Even if it 

\section{EVIDENCE}

were being offered to prove its truth, it would not be hearsay under the Federal Rules because it qualifies as a vicarious admission by a party-opponent. [Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D)] Cobb made the statement in his capacity as chairman of the board of Macho; hence, it will be admissible against Macho as an admission. (C) and (D) are incorrect because the best evidence rule applies only when the writing or recording is a legally operative or dispositive instrument or the knowledge of the witness comes from reading the document or listening to the recording. The best evidence rule does not apply where, as here, the fact to be proved exists independently of any writing or recording, and the witness testifying to the fact (Frogman) has knowledge of the fact independent of the audiotape or the transcription.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(C) The barograph record is admissible only if it is properly authenticated. Before a writing or any secondary evidence of its content may be received in evidence, the writing must be authenticated by proof showing that the writing is what the proponent says it is. In general, a writing may be authenticated by any evidence that serves to establish its authenticity. One means of authentication under Federal Rule $901(\mathrm{~b})$ is by evidence describing a process or system used to produce a result and showing that the process or system produces an accurate result. Hence, for Akiro's barograph record to be admissible, evidence must be offered that the instrument is accurate and that it was in good working order when the record was produced. (A) is incorrect because past recollection recorded is inapplicable here. Past recollection recorded is an exception to the hearsay rule that applies when a witness testifying about an event has insufficient recollection of it, even after consulting a writing of the event. The writing itself may be read into evidence if a proper foundation has been laid for its admissibility. Here, no witness is testifying-the barograph record is being offered independent of any testimony. (B) is wrong because the hearsay exception for records of regularly conducted activity applies only to records made in the regular course of a business. Although "business" is defined broadly under the Federal Rules to include churches and other not-for-profit organizations, it does not include what Akiro does for a hobby in his backyard. Hence, that hearsay exception is inapplicable. (D) is incorrect because the barograph record is not hearsay. Under the Federal Rules, hearsay is "a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted." A "statement" under the Federal Rules is an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct by a person intended as an assertion. A machine such as the barograph is not making or intending to make an assertion when it creates a record of an event; hence, the record is not a "statement" for purposes of the hearsay rule.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(A) Walter's testimony is admissible only to challenge the credibility of Bob's earlier inconsistent statement. Because the credibility of a hearsay declarant is as much at issue as the credibility of an in-court witness, Federal Rule 806 allows statements of a hearsay declarant to be impeached to the same extent as those of an in-court witness. Thus, a statement of the declarant made at any time that is inconsistent with his hearsay statement may be offered into evidence for impeachment purposes. Here, Bob's hearsay statement (which was admissible as an excited utterance) was testified to by Wilma. Bob's subsequent statement to Walter is inconsistent with his hearsay statement and is therefore admissible to discredit that statement. (B) is wrong because the statement would be hearsay not within any exception if it were offered as substantive evidence. Under Federal Rule 801(d)(1), prior inconsistent statements are only admissible as substantive evidence when they are statements of a witness who is now testifying at trial and were made under oath at a prior trial or deposition. (C) is wrong because the general requirement that an impeached witness be given an opportunity to explain or deny an apparently inconsistent statement does not apply to hearsay declarants. Because hearsay statements are often admissible at trial after the declarant has died or is otherwise unavailable, Rule 806 provides that the declarant need not be given an opportunity to explain or deny statements that are inconsistent with the declarant's hearsay statement. (D) is wrong because the statement is admissible for the purpose of impeachment; hence, it does not fall within the definition of hearsay.

\section{REAL PROPERTY ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(B) Magnolia has a life estate pur autre vie and can be compelled to pay the property taxes. A life estate is an estate that is not terminable at any fixed or computable period of time, but cannot last longer than the life of a particular person. A life estate pur autre vie (for the life of another) is a life estate measured by the life of someone other than the life tenant. Such an estate will be created when the grantor conveys a life estate to $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{A}$ later conveys his interest to $\mathrm{B}$. $\mathrm{B}$ owns an estate measured by A's life; it ends when A dies. Here, Nelson received a life estate in Redacre because the property would go to Dora on Nelson's death. When Nelson conveyed "his interest" to Magnolia, she received a life estate only for the period of Nelson's life. Under the doctrine of waste, the holder of a life estate is entitled to all the ordinary uses and profits of the land, but she cannot lawfully do any act that would injure the interests of the person who owns the remainder. If she does, the future interest holder may sue for damages and/or to enjoin such acts. Permissive waste occurs when the life tenant fails to take reasonable measures to protect the land, such as paying property taxes that are due. A life tenant is obligated to pay all ordinary taxes on the land to the extent of its reasonable value. Thus, Magnolia is obligated to pay property taxes for her period of occupancy. Dora holds a remainder interest in Redacre because she will acquire it when Nelson dies; therefore, she can protect her interest by compelling Magnolia to pay the taxes. (A) is incorrect because Magnolia only received the interest that Nelson had, which was an estate for his life. He did not have the power to convey a life estate for the period of Magnolia's life. (C) is wrong because, as discussed above, a life tenant has a duty to pay such taxes. (D) is incorrect because there was nothing in Orville's conveyance of the life estate to Nelson that prevented him from conveying his interest to another. Despite the general rule against restraints on alienation of property interests, a restraint on the transfer of a life estate that causes it to be forfeited if a transfer is attempted is a valid restraint on alienation. However, any such restraint must be specified in the conveyance itself. Here, no restraint on alienation existed in the conveyance to Nelson; thus, he was free to convey his interest to Magnolia.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(D) Suzanne takes a life estate pursuant to Hiram's will as the eldest grandchild living at Horace's death, but the remainder to Hiram's great-grandchildren is void because it violates the Rule Against Perpetuities. The Rule Against Perpetuities requires that an interest in property, to be valid, must vest, if at all, not later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. In the case of a will, the perpetuities period begins to run on the date of the testator's death, and measuring lives used to show the validity of an interest must be in existence at that time. An interest that violates the Rule is void and is stricken. However, all other interests created in the instrument of transfer that are valid under the Rule are given effect. Here, at the time the interests are created (Hiram's death), Horace's life estate vests immediately. The next life estate (to the eldest grandchild living at Horace's death) will vest, if at all, upon the death of Horace, a life in being at the creation of the interest. Thus, the life estate to such eldest grandchild (which turned out to be Suzanne) is valid under the Rule. However, the gift to Hiram's great-grandchildren may not vest within a life in being plus 21 years. A grandchild born after Hiram's death (who is therefore not a life in being) may survive Horace as the eldest grandchild of Hiram, and may live for 21 years after Horace's death. In that event, the gift over to the great-grandchildren would vest outside of lives in being plus 21 years. It does not matter that the grandchild who actually survived Horace as the eldest, Suzanne, was alive at Hiram's death (and therefore a life in being). The interest is void because there is a possibility, viewed at the time the interest is created, that it 

\section{REAL PROPERTY}

will not vest within the period under the Rule. Therefore, the attempted gift of a remainder to the great-grandchildren is void under the Rule, and is stricken. The failure of this gift leaves a reversion in the testator, Hiram, which will pass to his heirs. (A) is incorrect because it ignores the fact that, despite the invalidity of the attempted gift to Hiram's great-grandchildren, Suzanne's life estate remains valid and takes effect. (B) incorrectly states that title goes to the four grandchildren living at Hiram's death. According to Hiram's will, the only interest to be given to any grandchild was a life estate, to be given to the eldest grandchild living at Horace's death. Thus, of the four grandchildren listed in (B), only Suzanne (as the eldest grandchild living at Horace's death) is entitled to an interest, and then only to a life estate. (C) is incorrect because, as explained above, the remainder to the great-grandchildren is stricken as violative of the Rule Against Perpetuities. Thus, the remainder goes to Hiram's heirs rather than to the great-grandchildren.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(D) The attempted contingent gift to the Boy Scouts' Council is void under the Rule Against Perpetuities. Under the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, an interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years of a life in being. The devise to Ronald gives him a fee simple determinable subject to an executory interest and attempts to give the Boy Scouts an executory interest in fee simple. However, the Boy Scouts' interest is void under the Rule because the camp might be used for noncamping or nonrecreational purposes long after any life in being plus 21 years. Thus, what remains is Ronald's fee simple determinable interest. Since Powell did not otherwise provide who would take if the Boy Scouts' interest failed, he was left with a possibility of reverter. Such an interest is not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities. As Powell's sole heir, Erma took his possibility of reverter, and upon her death, her heir, Harold, took the interest. Thus, Harold has a possibility of reverter and the Boy Scouts have nothing, making (D) correct and (A) incorrect. (B) is incorrect because an executory interest is a future estate of transferees. Harold's interest arises through descent from Powell, the transferor, and so it must be a possibility of reverter rather than an executory interest. (C) is incorrect; remainders, whether vested or contingent, do not follow fees simple, including fees simple determinable, because remainders follow the natural termination of the preceding estate (a life estate) and fees simple do not naturally terminate. Any interest following a fee simple determinable is either a possibility of reverter (if held by or through the transferor) or an executory interest (if held by or through the transferee).

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(A) The nonassignment clause is valid and Miller may enforce it by terminating the lease and regaining possession of the store. Nonassignment clauses in leases are valid and enforceable even though strictly construed, and allow the landlord in most states to refuse to consent to an assignment even if the refusal is unreasonable. If a tenant makes an assignment in violation of a nonassignment clause in the lease, the transfer is not void. However, the landlord may terminate the lease if specifically provided by the nonassignment clause. Alternatively, he may sue for damages if he can prove any. Only choice (A) upholds the validity of the nonassignment clause. Choice (B) is incorrect. While most courts require a landlord to mitigate damages where a tenant unjustifiably abandons the property, this duty does not affect the landlord's power to terminate the lease because of a breach of the lease agreement. Dwight will still be liable to Miller for any damages from the unauthorized assignment, including the cost of evicting Ariel. (C) is incorrect because most states do not require that a landlord's refusal to accept a new tenant be reasonable. Furthermore, the fact that Ariel is operating the same type of business does not mean that Miller has suffered no harm, since she might be a much poorer credit risk than Dwight. (D) is incorrect. As an exception to the general rule that any restriction on the transferability of a legal interest in property is void, a provision in a lease prohibiting the lessee's assignment or subletting of her leasehold interest without the consent of the landlord is given effect in all jurisdictions.

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(D) Dan must pay 10 days' lodging because his notice to terminate will not become effective until then. In the usual case, a hotel guest is treated as a licensee rather than a tenant. Here, however, the court found that the parties created a tenancy because they specifically agreed to a week-toweek arrangement at a special weekly rate. A periodic tenancy arises when the parties do not fix the duration of the tenancy. It continues from period to period and is automatically renewed for another period until terminated by the giving of proper notice. The period is generally based on an express understanding between the parties or an implied understanding based on the payment of rent. Dan's arrangement with the hotel constitutes a periodic week-to-week tenancy because it was of indefinite duration and "rent" was paid each week. To terminate a periodic tenancy of less than one year, a full period in advance of the period in question is required by way of notice. For a week-to-week tenancy, notice at least one full week prior to vacating would have to be given prior to the beginning of the period. Thus, Dan's notice had no effect on his liability for that week's rent and would operate as one week's notice starting at the beginning of the next week. (A) is incorrect. If the parties had expressly agreed that either party could terminate at any time, a tenancy at will would have been created and Dan would be liable for nothing. However, the payment of rent on a regular periodic basis will cause a court to treat the tenancy as a periodic tenancy. (B) is incorrect because it does not take the one week's notice requirement into account. (C) is incorrect because the notice must fix the last day of the period as the date of termination rather than some intervening day. Thus, the notice period does not begin to run until the end of the current week.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(B) Wallace has a valid easement, which was created by express grant, properly recorded, and presumed to be of perpetual duration. It is enforceable against Cyd, the subsequent purchaser of the servient estate, because nothing has occurred to terminate the easement. While an easement may be extinguished by abandonment, mere nonuse does not qualify as abandonment. Rather, there must be a physical manifestation of an intent to permanently abandon (e.g., building a permanent structure blocking access to the easement). Since Wallace did not manifest an intent to permanently abandon, (A) is incorrect. (C) is incorrect because Wallace has an easement created by express grant, not implied by necessity. An easement by necessity arises by implication when the owner of a tract of land sells part of the tract and by this division deprives one lot of access to a public road or utility line. Aside from the fact that Wallace has an express easement and need not resort to one by implication, nothing in these facts indicates that Wallace purchased Woodlot from the owner of Smoothacre or that the paved way through Smoothacre was Woodlot's only access to any public road. (D) is incorrect because the easement was not interfered with for the 15 -year prescription period. For an easement to terminate by prescription, the owner of the servient tenement must so interfere with the easement as to create a cause of action in favor of the easement holder. The adverse use must be open, notorious, continuous, and nonpermissive for the requisite period. The original owner of the servient estate, Arnold, apparently did nothing to interfere with Wallace's easement. Cyd, Arnold's successor, did everything necessary to terminate the easement by prescription, but his adverse use has lasted only six months instead of 15 years. 

\section{REAL PROPERTY}

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(D) Michael's leasing Blackacre to Theresa for 15 years will allow him to acquire title by adverse possession. Title by adverse possession results when the owner of real property does not, within the period set by the statute of limitations, take legal action to eject a possessor who claims adversely to the owner. The owner is thereafter barred from bringing suit for ejectment and title to the property vests in the possessor. For one to obtain title by adverse possession, the possession must be (i) open and notorious (i.e., such as the usual owner would make of the land), (ii) actual and exclusive (i.e., not in conjunction with the true owner or the public at large), (iii) continuous throughout the statutory period, and (iv) hostile. Here, Michael's act of leasing Blackacre is a kind of use that a true owner would make of the property; thus, it is an "actual" possession even though Michael himself is not living on the property. Theresa's occupancy is open and notorious, since Seymour discovered it as soon as he came to look at Blackacre. Michael's possession is exclusive because he has allowed only his tenant to enter onto the property. It is continuous because his tenant has occupied the property throughout the 15 years, and it is hostile because Michael acted without the true owner's permission and in derogation of the true owner's rights. Having satisfied all of the requirements for adverse possession, Michael should be declared to be the owner of Blackacre. (A) is incorrect because a lease to a third party does constitute actual possession by Michael. Leasing the property is a type of use that a true owner would make of the property, and occupancy by the adverse possessor's tenant would give the true owner notice that a trespass is occurring. (B) is incorrect because Seymour's ignorance of the fact that Blackacre was occupied is not an excuse. Theresa's occupancy was sufficiently apparent to put Seymour on notice that a trespass was occurring. His failure to visit the property during the statutory period provides him with no defense. (C) is incorrect because Seymour's abandonment of Blackacre is not sufficient to bestow title by adverse possession on Michael. Michael must satisfy the adverse possession requirements to obtain title.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(B) Bart cannot evict Newt because he is not yet the owner of Springfield. The instrument of conveyance signed by Homer conveyed only a future interest and not a present estate. A future interest is an estate that does not entitle the owner thereof to possession, but it will or may in the future become a present interest. Because Homer's estate is not a life estate, the future interest conveyed to Bart is an executory interest. Furthermore, it is a springing executory interest because it divests the estate of the transferor, Homer (i.e., Homer's fee simple will be cut short if and when Bart receives his degree before age 30). Because Homer has retained his present estate, which is a fee simple subject to the springing executory interests of Bart and Lisa, only Homer would have the power to evict Newt. Bart, as the holder of a future interest, has no right to possession of the property and therefore has no cause of action against another in possession. (A) is incorrect because the language of Homer's conveyance clearly indicates that he is conveying a future interest rather than a present interest. (A) would have been correct if Homer had used the following language in his conveyance: "to my son Bart; provided, however, that if Bart does not receive a college degree by his 30th birthday, title shall pass to my daughter Lisa." Bart would have had a fee simple subject to divestment by Lisa's executory interest. Here, however, Homer expressly stated that Bart's receipt of a college degree was a condition precedent to the transfer of the property. Hence, Bart has only a future interest and not a fee simple of any kind. (C) is incorrect. If Bart had acquired a present possessory interest in the property, nothing would have prevented him from evicting Newt, regardless of his motivation. (D) is incorrect. If Homer had conveyed his present interest in the property, Newt's tenancy would have been terminated by operation of law because it was, at most, a tenancy at will. However, Homer conveyed only a future interest to Bart, so the conveyance had no effect on Newt's tenancy. 

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(A) The court should require specific performance of Partridge and Wren. When a transfer of land is preceded by a contract for sale, the risk of loss to the property during that time interval is imposed on the buyer in most jurisdictions. Thus, despite a loss due to fire or other casualty (assuming it was not due to the fault of either party), the buyer must still pay the contract price at the closing date unless the contract provides otherwise. Consequently, Partridge and Wren were still under a duty to tender the amount due on the property. Their failure to do so puts them in breach of contract, allowing Eagle to obtain specific performance (payment of the balance due on the contract). (B) is wrong because the preferred remedy for Eagle is specific performance. While Eagle could obtain a damage remedy based on the difference between the contract price and the market value of the land on the date of the breach, that would leave him with the task as executor of trying to resell the property. Because land is considered unique, a buyer is entitled to specific performance of the contract. On mutuality of remedy grounds, the seller (Eagle) can also get that remedy. (C) is incorrect because, as discussed above, the destruction of the garage does not allow Partridge and Wren to avoid performing the contract. They bore the risk of loss and could not obtain a refund of the earnest money even if Eagle had not sought to enforce the contract. (D) is incorrect because the contract can be specifically enforced. The reason that the buyer bears the risk of loss is that the doctrine of equitable conversion treats the buyer as the equitable owner of the land once the contract is signed. Hence, Owl's death would not prevent Partridge and Wren from specifically enforcing the contract by requiring Eagle to transfer legal title. Mutuality of remedy requires that this same remedy be available to Owl's executor, who is regarded as being owed a debt of the balance due on the contract. Eagle can therefore require payment of the balance as specific performance of the contract.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(C) The court is likely to rule against Oiler because the covenant providing for the right of first refusal violates the Rule Against Perpetuities. Under the Rule, no interest in property is valid unless it must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after a life in being at the creation of the interest. The Rule applies to rights of first refusal. Thus, if the right might be exercised later than the end of the perpetuities period, it is void. Since the interest ran to both parties' heirs and assigns, there was no limit on Oiler's right of first refusal; therefore, it could easily have been exercised beyond the perpetuities period, and so it violates the Rule. (A) is incorrect. The recording statute quoted by the question is a race-notice statute. Under a race-notice statute, a subsequent bona fide purchaser, such as Cowboy, is protected if he records before the prior grantee. To qualify as a bona fide purchaser, a person must, at the time of the conveyance, take without actual, constructive, or record notice of the prior interest. Since the deed to Astro was recorded, Cowboy had record notice of the right of first refusal because it was in his chain of title. Had the covenant been within the perpetuities period, Cowboy would not have been protected by the recording act. However, since the covenant is void, Oiler has no right to the property. Similarly, (B) is incorrect. The bad faith transaction of Astro and Ranger would not have overcome the covenant had the covenant not violated the Rule. In light of the fact that the covenant is void, however, their bad faith is irrelevant. (D) is incorrect because the covenant runs with the land. The requirements for the burden of the covenant to run are met in this case: The fact that the original covenanting parties intended the right of first refusal covenant to run to their successors is indicated by the use of the language "heirs and assigns." The notice requirement was fulfilled by recording the deed. The horizontal privity requirement is satisfied by the fact that Oiler and Astro shared an interest in the land independent of the covenant, i.e., as grantor and grantee. The necessary vertical privity is also present, because Ranger and Cowboy held the entire durational 

\section{REAL PROPERTY}

interest held by Oiler when the covenant was made. Last, the covenant runs with the land because it "touches and concerns" the land; i.e., it diminishes the landowner's right with respect to Cattlefork.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(B) The court should partition Forestacre into two separate tracts. A court will presume that the devise to Pelt and Dash gave them a tenancy in common in Forestacre. Hence, each of them has the right to possess all portions of the property; neither of them has the right to exclusive possession of any part. However, any tenant in common has a right to judicial partition of the property, either in kind or by sale and division of the proceeds. When co-tenants are squabbling and cannot come to any agreement, the remedy of partition terminates the co-tenancy and divides the common property. Since Pelt and Dash cannot agree on the use of Forestacre by members of the hunting club, the court will probably partition the property. (A) is wrong because, even though there is no indication that Dash has ousted Pelt, i.e., wrongfully excluded him from possession of the property, Pelt is entitled to the remedy of partition because the parties cannot agree on the use of the property. (C) is wrong because Torrens did not own Forestacre at the time he attempted to convey the property in trust. While the instrument Torrens executed was in writing and properly identified the trustees and an appropriate beneficiary, Torrens had already conveyed away in fee simple his interest in the property; thus, he did not have the power to create a trust of Forestacre. (D) is wrong despite the fact that Pelt is entitled to possession and use of all of Forestacre to the same extent as Dash. Since the co-tenants cannot agree on this particular use of the land by members of the hunting club, a court will grant whichever tenant is before it the remedy of partition.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(B) Dave will prevail only against Carla because only Carla has committed an actionable breach of the covenant against encumbrances. A grantor making a conveyance by general warranty deed generally makes five covenants for title, and warrants against title defects created both by herself and by all prior titleholders. The covenant of seisin, the covenant of right to convey, and the covenant against encumbrances are present covenants and are breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance. The covenant for quiet enjoyment and the covenant of warranty are future covenants and are breached only upon interference with the possession of the grantee or his successors. Unlike the future covenants, the present covenants do not "run" with the grantee's estate and cannot be enforced against the covenantor by successive grantees in most jurisdictions. Here, because the party holding the judgment lien has not taken any action to enforce it, there is no disturbance of possession and the future covenants have not been breached. Since the only covenant that has been breached was the covenant against encumbrances, only Dave's grantor, Carla, is liable. (A) is incorrect because most jurisdictions hold that a covenant against encumbrances is breached even if the grantee knew of the encumbrance, particularly if it is an encumbrance on title, such as a mortgage or lien, rather than a physical encumbrance such as an easement. (C) is incorrect even though it is true that Brenda will not be liable because she conveyed by special warranty deed, which covenants only that the grantor herself did not create any title defects. As discussed above, Allen is not liable to Dave because any future covenants he made have not been breached. (D) is incorrect because, as discussed above, neither Allen nor Brenda has breached any covenant owed to Dave, regardless of their knowledge of the lien. On the other hand, Carla has breached her covenant against encumbrances despite her ignorance of the judgment lien.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(C) Christie owns Blackacre free of the mortgage because Brittany's status as a bona fide purchaser without notice brings the "shelter rule" into play. In general, a person who takes from a bona fide purchaser will prevail against any interest that the transferor-bona fide purchaser would have prevailed against, even if the person taking the property has actual or record notice of the prior interest. Hence, Brittany's status as a bona fide purchaser without notice "shelters" Christie from Maritime Bank's interest, and (C) is correct. (A) is incorrect because Christie's "sheltered" status as a transferee of a bona fide purchaser makes the fact that the recording act does not directly protect donees irrelevant. (B) is incorrect because a pure notice recording statute requires actual or constructive notice at the time of the conveyance. When Brittany conveyed to Christie, Maritime Bank had not yet recorded. (D) is incorrect because mortgagees for value are treated as "purchasers" under the recording act.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(A) Darlene's ownership of Copperacre is subject to Yukon's interest because Yukon's interest was first in time. The common law rule that priority is given to the grantee who was first in time still applies unless operation of the jurisdiction's recording statute changes the result. The statute in this question is a race-notice statute, under which a subsequent bona fide purchaser is protected only if she records her interest before the prior grantee does. While Darlene is a bona fide purchaser, she must still win the race to the recording office to prevail over Yukon's prior interest. Since neither party has recorded in this fact pattern, Darlene will take the property subject to Yukon's prior interest. (B) is wrong because Yukon's option is treated as an interest in land just like his leasehold interest, regardless of the fact that it cannot yet be exercised. (C) is wrong because Darlene probably would prevail if she were to record now. Under the recording statute, it is irrelevant that Darlene became aware of Yukon's interest at a later point; at the time of the conveyance to her, she did not have notice of his interest and therefore qualifies as a bona fide purchaser. Had she recorded when she first encountered Yukon, she would have prevailed. Even if she were to record now, she could still prevail if Yukon does not record first. (D) is incorrect because it states the result under a notice statute. In contrast to a notice statute, the race-notice statute in the question would still permit Yukon to prevail even though he failed to record before Darlene purchased the property, as long as Darlene does not record before he does.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(A) Unless Tully pays off the entire loan, First Bank can foreclose on Sweetacre. When a mortgagor sells his mortgaged property and gives a deed, the grantee takes subject to the mortgage, which remains on the land. A mortgage containing a "due-on-sale" clause allows the lender to demand full payment of the loan if the mortgagor transfers an interest in the property without the lender's consent. Under federal law, due-on-sale clauses are generally enforceable. Here, First Bank apparently did not consent to the transfer and Burt did not pay off the mortgage. The mortgage remained on Sweetacre and will allow First Bank to foreclose on Sweetacre unless Tully extinguishes the mortgage by paying off the entire loan. (B) is incorrect because First Bank cannot require Tully to assume the mortgage, which would make Tully personally liable on the loan (i.e., make him liable for the balance of the loan if the bank forecloses and the foreclosure sale does not bring in enough to pay off the loan balance). However, First Bank can foreclose even if Tully does not agree to assume the mortgage. While the original mortgagor remains primarily and 

\section{REAL PROPERTY}

personally liable, if the mortgagor has not paid off the mortgage and the grantee (Tully) does not pay, the mortgage may be foreclosed because it remains on the land. (C) is incorrect because there is no indication that Tully signed an assumption agreement. The due-on-sale clause will allow the bank to foreclose but will not make Tully personally liable for any deficit after the foreclosure sale. (D) is incorrect. While some states refused to enforce these clauses unless the lender's security was endangered by sale to a poor credit risk, federal statute now makes due-onsale clauses enforceable even if the lender is using it simply as an opportunity to raise the interest rate when the property is sold.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(B) TNB can require either Able or Brett to pay the deficiency. When a mortgage is foreclosed and the proceeds of the foreclosure sale are insufficient to satisfy the mortgage debt, the mortgagee can bring a personal action against the mortgagor for the deficiency. The mortgagor remains personally liable on the mortgage loan regardless of any subsequent transfers of the mortgaged property. Hence, Able remains liable to TNB for the deficiency because he was the original mortgagor. Brett is also liable for the deficiency because he "assumed payment of" the mortgage. When a grantee signs an assumption agreement, promising to pay the mortgage loan, he becomes primarily liable to the lender (who is a third-party beneficiary of the assumption agreement), while the original mortgagor becomes secondarily liable as a surety. Thus, TNB can seek judgment against either Able or Brett for the deficiency, making (B) correct and (A) incorrect. (C) and (D) are incorrect because Carly is not liable for the deficiency. When a mortgagor sells property and conveys a deed, the grantee takes subject to the mortgage, which remains on the land (unless the proceeds of the sale are used to pay off the mortgage). However, a grantee who does not sign an assumption agreement does not become personally liable on the loan. Instead, the original mortgagor remains primarily and personally liable. Here, Carly only took "subject to the mortgage," without assuming it. Thus, she cannot be required to pay the deficiency.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(C) Casbank should have its mortgage fully satisfied from the proceeds of the foreclosure sale, and the remainder should go toward satisfying Brubank's junior interest. As a general rule, the priority of a mortgage is determined by the time it was placed on the property. When a mortgage is foreclosed, the buyer at the sale will take title as it existed when the mortgage was placed on the property. Thus, foreclosure will destroy interests junior to the placing of the mortgage but will not discharge senior interests, which remain on the property. However, where a landowner enters into a modification agreement with the senior mortgagee that makes the mortgage more burdensome, the junior mortgage will be given priority over the modification. In particular, if a junior mortgage is placed on the property and the senior lender later makes an optional advance while having notice of the junior lien, the advance will lose priority to the junior lien. (An optional advance is one that the senior lender is not contractually bound to make.) Here, the senior mortgage of Brubank was modified by the additional advance after creation of the junior mortgage with Casbank; hence, the increase in the debt to Brubank will not have priority over Casbank's interest. Therefore, the proceeds of the foreclosure sale will be applied first to satisfy the $\$ 15,000$ mortgage of Casbank that is being foreclosed, and the balance of $\$ 3,000$ will go toward the $\$ 15,000$ modification of Brubank's mortgage. This leaves a $\$ 12,000$ deficiency, for which Augustus might be liable, and leaves the original $\$ 20,000$ mortgage of Brubank, which remains on the property in the hands of the foreclosure sale buyer. (A) is wrong because Brubank's senior interest on the property is not affected by Casbank's foreclosure action; since Augustus is not in default on that mortgage, Brubank is not entitled to recover foreclosure proceeds for it. (B) is incorrect because the foreclosure proceeds are not divided proportionally between the interests affected by the foreclosure; they are first applied to fully satisfy the foreclosed mortgage, and whatever is left over is applied toward any junior interests in order of priority. (D) is wrong because Brubank's additional advance is junior to the Casbank mortgage and is wiped out by its foreclosure; hence, the balance of the proceeds after Casbank's mortgage is satisfied will be paid to partially satisfy Brubank's junior interest.

\section{TORTS ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(C) If Dietz did not know he was striking a person, he did not have the required intent for battery. To establish a prima facie case for an intentional tort such as battery, plaintiff must prove (i) an act by defendant, (ii) intent, and (iii) causation. The intent of the actor that is relevant for purposes of intentional torts is the intent to bring about the consequences that are the basis of the tort. An actor "intends" these consequences when his goal is to bring them about or when he knows with substantial certainty that they will result from his actions. The intent required for battery is an intent to bring about harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person. [Restatement (Second) of Torts $\S 13(a)$ ] If Dietz did not know that he was striking a person, he could not have intended or known that a harmful or offensive contact with the person would result. Therefore, he will not have the intent required for battery. (A) is incorrect because the intent required is not an intent to cause harm to the person, but rather an intent to bring about the harmful or offensive contact. ("Offensive" contact is contact that the plaintiff has not expressly or impliedly consented to.) Thus, as long as Dietz at least knew that he was bringing about an offensive contact with Pansy, he will be liable for battery even though he had no desire to harm Pansy. (B) is incorrect because Dietz's mental illness does not preclude him from possessing the requisite intent for battery. As long as he was capable of intending the consequences of his conduct, i.e., intending to bring about the harmful or offensive contact, his inability to understand that his act was wrongful is irrelevant. (D) is incorrect because the defense of self-defense is only available when a person has reasonable grounds to believe that he is being attacked or is about to be attacked. This is an objective test-how the situation would have looked to a reasonable person under the circumstances. The facts here make it clear that a reasonable person would not have believed that he was about to be attacked. Dietz therefore will not be able to successfully claim self-defense.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(D) Paul will prevail because Donnalou had the intent to commit a battery. To establish a prima facie case for battery, plaintiff must establish (i) an act by defendant that brings about harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person, (ii) intent on the part of the defendant to bring about harmful or offensive contact to plaintiff's person, and (iii) causation. The harmful or offensive contact may be either direct or indirect; i.e., it is sufficient if defendant sets in motion a force that brings about harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person. Here, all of the elements are present for a battery case against Donnalou. She acted by placing the drug in Paul's juice knowing that he would drink it. While she did not expect Paul to have a severe reaction to the drug, she did intend for it to affect him; i.e., she intended an offensive contact. Paul can establish causation not only for the initial reaction but also for the injuries from the car crash, because his ingestion of the drug was a substantial factor in bringing about those injuries. Thus, Paul can establish a prima facie case for battery against Donnalou, and Donnalou has no legitimate defenses that will prevent Paul from recovering for his injuries. (A) is incorrect because Dr. Pillpush's negligence does not break the causal connection between Paul's injuries from the auto accident and Donnalou's tortious act. Even though the accident would not have occurred but for the doctor's negligence, Donnalou's conduct was the primary factor in bringing about Paul's injuries. (B) is incorrect because Donnalou's lack of intent to harm Paul is irrelevant. As long as she intended that Paul ingest the drug, she intended an offensive contact. Thus, she is liable for battery even though she did not intend to harm Paul. (C) is incorrect. Unlike in negligence cases, the unforeseeability of additional forces that contribute to plaintiff's injury in an intentional tort case does not make them superseding forces that break the causal connection between the initial wrongful act and the ultimate injury. Even if the automobile accident could not have reasonably 130. TORTS

been foreseen, Donnalou will be liable because her conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(C) Steve can recover $\$ 18,000$ from Randy for conversion. A conversion is an interference with plaintiff's possessory rights in a chattel that is so serious as to warrant that the defendant pay full value for the chattel. Here, Randy's permission to use the boat had long since expired when the boat was severely damaged by the tree. While Randy would not have been responsible for that damage had it occurred while he was still rightfully in possession of the boat, the combination of the wrongful detention and the severe damage amounts to a conversion. Hence, Steve is entitled to recover damages for the fair market value of the boat at the time and place of conversion, in effect creating a forced sale of the boat. (A) and (B) are wrong because Steve can recover more than the actual damage to the boat and damages for dispossession; those remedies are appropriate for trespass to chattels, which is a less serious interference with plaintiff's possessory rights in a chattel. (B) and (D) are wrong because Steve is not liable for the damage to Randy's garden when he went to retrieve the boat. When a chattel is located on the land of a wrongdoer, the owner is privileged to enter upon the land and reclaim it in a reasonable manner. Unlike an entry onto the land of an innocent party, reasonable entry onto the land of a wrongdoer is completely privileged; i.e., the chattel owner does not have to pay for any actual damage caused by the entry.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(D) Mommy will lose because she will not be able to establish a prima facie case for negligent infliction of emotional distress. An action for negligent infliction of emotional distress requires plaintiff to show that defendant's conduct created a foreseeable risk of physical injury to plaintiff, and that the emotional distress caused by this conduct also resulted in some physical injury to plaintiff. Here, the first element is established because the negligence of the theater employee created a foreseeable risk that Mommy would be injured by biting down on the coin, but the second element is not established because Mommy's nightmares and loss of sleep that night do not amount to an actionable physical injury, and she suffered no other injury by biting the coin. Note that if she had suffered physical injury by biting the coin, she would have a prima facie case against the theater for negligence. She then would have been able to recover for her emotional distress as a "parasitic" element of her physical injury damages. (A) is incorrect because Dizzie's negligence only establishes the first element of the case for negligent infliction of emotional distress; the element of physical injury is not established. (B) is incorrect because emotional distress alone is not a sufficient injury where the defendant's conduct was only negligent. If Dizzie instead had purposely put the coin in the popcorn with knowledge or reckless disregard of the likely effect of his conduct, Mommy's emotional distress probably would be sufficient for establishing a prima facie case of intentional infliction of emotional distress. (C) is wrong because the element of emotional distress in this tort does not depend upon foreseeability or a reasonable person standard; only the initial threat of physical injury need be foreseeable. Had Mommy otherwise established a prima facie case by proving physical injury, the fact that a reasonable person would not have suffered similar distress is irrelevant.

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(A) Hound could not recover his economic losses from the injury to his dog unless Publectric was negligent. If Publectric was negligent, Hound could recover any property damage caused by the negligence, including whatever decline in the dog's value Hound is able to prove. (B) is incorrect because the fact that the guardrail meets typical industry standards does not preclude a finding of negligence. If adherence to industry standards does not prevent an unreasonable risk of harm, defendant may be in breach of its duty of ordinary care. (C) is incorrect; the fact that the dog escaped from Hound's yard would only be relevant if it indicated contributory negligence on Hound's part. In this case, Hound frequently walked the dog on his lawn without a leash and had no advance warning that the dog would suddenly bolt after a squirrel; his conduct is not so lacking in due care as to amount to contributory negligence. (D) is wrong because that option does not take into account the duty of care to avoid injury to property. Although a lesser degree of care may be required where the defendant's conduct poses a risk of harm only to property and not to persons, the same general rules of negligence apply. Hence, if Publectric's conduct creates a risk of injury to property that is deemed unreasonable (based on the magnitude of the risk and the utility of the conduct), it may incur liability even though it created no risk of injury to persons.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(B) MMMA has breached its duty of care to Norton if it had reason to know of the danger. An owner or occupier of land owes a duty of care to make the premises reasonably safe for its invitees. For an owner of a place of public accommodation who gathers the public for profit, the duty extends to protecting its patrons from injury from third persons where the owner knew or should have known of the danger. Both Martha and Norton are business invitees of Modern Mall because Martha is a potential customer of the business, even though she was not planning to buy anything, and Norton is accompanying Martha. Thus, if MMMA had reason to know of any danger to Norton from criminal acts of third persons, MMMA has breached its duty to Norton. Norton should have little difficulty establishing actual cause, proximate cause, and damages, the other elements of his prima facie case. (Assuming that MMMA had reason to know of the danger of a criminal act against Norton, the act is foreseeable and thus not a superseding intervening force that would cut off the causal connection.) Hence, MMMA is likely to be found liable to Norton. (A) is incorrect because owners of land, even those opening their premises to the public for profit, are not strictly liable to their customers for injuries from third persons. MMMA must have been negligent for it to be liable to Norton. (C) is incorrect because a criminal act of a third person is a superseding force only if it is not foreseeable. If MMMA had reason to know of the danger of a criminal act against Norton, it was negligent in failing to take steps to eliminate the danger, and this negligence created a foreseeable risk that Norton would be harmed by a third person. (D) is incorrect because Norton was accompanying Martha, who was a potential customer of the business, and is therefore an invitee as to all areas of the mall that were open to the public, including its restrooms.

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(B) The fact least helpful to the city's defense of Penquist's lawsuit is the identity of the workers who blocked the exit ramp. Under vicarious liability rules, a principal will be liable for the tortious acts of an independent contractor if the duty is nondelegable on public policy grounds; included is the duty of a possessor of land to keep its premises safe for its invitees. If the workers were negligent in leaving the ramp blocked without providing another means of exiting, the fact that they were not city employees would not absolve the city of liability; hence, their identity would be of no help to the city's defense. (A) is incorrect because if Penquist was aware of an alternate route, he may have been contributorily negligent in exiting down the entrance ramp. A plaintiff's contributory negligence may be established by violation of an applicable statute. However, as with a statutory duty imposed on defendant, plaintiff's violation of the statute may be excused if compliance was beyond plaintiff's control. If no other means of exiting the garage were known 

\section{TORTS}

to Penquist, he may be excused for violating the traffic statute; however, if he knew of an alternative exit, the city will probably be able to establish contributory negligence on his part by his violation of the statute. (C) is incorrect because whether the city collects fees and makes a profit in operation of the garage will be considered by the court in determining whether the jurisdiction's governmental immunity applies. Where municipal immunity still exists, courts have limited its scope by differentiating between "governmental" and "proprietary" functions of the municipality. If the municipality is performing a function that might as well have been provided by a private corporation, the function may be construed as a proprietary one and no immunity will attach. The inference that a function is proprietary will be strengthened where the city collects revenues by virtue of providing the service. Hence, the fact that the city is not collecting revenues or making a profit in operating the garage will make it less likely that the function will be deemed to be proprietary and more likely that it will be deemed to be governmental and thus immune; in other words, it will be more helpful rather than less helpful in the city's defense. (D) is incorrect because Totten's conduct under these circumstances would be deemed a superseding force that breaks the causal connection between any negligence on the part of the city and Penquist's injury. Assuming that the city workers were negligent, the fact that an independent intervening force caused the injury generally would not cut off the city's liability, because its negligence created a foreseeable risk of that harm occurring. However, where this foreseeable harm is caused by an unforeseeable crime or intentional tort of a third party, most courts would not hold the city liable, treating the crime or tort as a superseding force. Here, while blocking the exit ramp created a foreseeable risk that someone might collide with Penquist, it was not foreseeable that his enemy would take that opportunity to commit an intentional tort against him. Because Totten's conduct was unforeseeable under the circumstances in choice (D), the city would be relieved of liability for any negligence in blocking the ramp.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(D) If Zarkov had reason to know of Ming's violent propensity, he could be liable for his own negligence in not attempting to search for Ming or alert the authorities. Under principles of vicarious liability, the tortious conduct of one person may be imputed to another person when a special relationship exists between the tortfeasor and the other person. However, a parent is not vicariously liable at common law for the tortious conduct of her child. The statute given in the question does not change this result; it merely establishes that Zarkov would be liable for Ming's conduct to the same extent as if he were Ming's parent. Given the absence of vicarious liability in this situation, the only liability that Zarkov might face is for his own negligence in not preventing the beating. If Zarkov had reason to know that Ming had a propensity to commit violent acts, Zarkov owed a duty to persons who might be injured by Ming, and this duty was breached by Zarkov's inaction after Ming was reported missing. Whether Zarkov's negligence can be shown to be the actual cause of Gordon's injury is not conclusively established by the facts; given the short interval between when Ming ran away and when he was discovered missing, and the long interval between the discovery and the beating a few blocks away from the institute, Gordon probably can prove actual cause. Proximate cause can also be established because Ming's intentional tort was foreseeable; it was the very conduct that Zarkov had a duty to take precautions against. Hence, given the factual assumption in choice (D), Zarkov probably will be liable for Gordon's injuries. (A) is incorrect because whether or not Ming would be liable for administering the beating has no effect on Zarkov's liability for his own negligence. (B) is wrong because the statute merely makes those standing in loco parentis liable to the same extent as parents. Because parents would not be liable in the absence of reason to know of their child's violent propensity, Zarkov also would be liable only under those circumstances. (C) is incorrect even though its statement of law is accurate. While Zarkov cannot be found vicariously liable for Ming's acts, he may be liable for his own negligence under the circumstances stated in choice (D).

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(C) The court should grant Shortstop's motion for a directed verdict because Jason has not established a prima facie case of negligence on Shortstop's part. Jason has established that Shortstop owed a duty to him and that he has suffered harm from the fire caused by the short in the wiring. However, he has not established that Shortstop breached any duty to him. While breach of duty is ordinarily a question for the trier of fact, plaintiff's failure to offer any evidence on that element of the prima facie case will permit a directed verdict for defendant. Under certain circumstances, the fact that a particular injury occurred may itself establish or tend to establish a breach of duty owed, permitting the trier of fact to infer defendant's liability. This is the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur ("the thing speaks for itself"). However, for the doctrine to apply, plaintiff must show that (i) the accident causing his injury is the type that would not normally occur unless someone was negligent; (ii) the negligence was attributable to defendant; and (iii) the injury was not attributable to plaintiff. The second requirement can often be satisfied by showing that the instrumentality causing the injury was in the exclusive control of the defendant. Here, however, the wiring was exposed to work done by other contractors on an immediately adjacent chimney and hot water pipe, and in putting up the walls, and Jason has offered no evidence that the cut in the outer sheath of the wiring was present when Shortstop finished its work. Instead, the fact that the wiring had been approved by the building inspector suggests that the wiring was intact when Shortstop finished. Given these facts, Jason has not presented evidence that the negligence was attributable to the defendant. Since res ipsa loquitur does not apply and no other evidence of breach of duty was established, Shortstop's motion for a directed verdict should be granted. (C) is therefore correct and (A) and (B) are incorrect. (B) is also incorrect because Jason's motion for a directed verdict would be denied even if he had established res ipsa loquitur. Establishing res ipsa loquitur merely creates a permissible inference of negligence; it does not create a presumption of negligence. Where the res ipsa loquitur element has been proved, plaintiff has established a prima facie breach of duty on defendant's part and no directed verdict may be given for defendant. However, it does not require defendant to present evidence to rebut a presumption. The trier of fact is free to accept the inference of negligence that has been created and find for the plaintiff or reject the inference of negligence and find for the defendant, even if the defendant offers no other evidence on the issue. Thus, the court would not grant Jason's motion for a directed verdict even if he had established res ipsa loquitur. (D) is incorrect because Shortstop is not strictly liable for the short in the wiring. Jason's failure to offer some evidence of negligence on the part of Shortstop will allow Shortstop to prevail.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(B) Hospital Suppliers would be liable to Paul in a strict products liability action if it could have installed a safety latch on the footrest without incurring unreasonable additional cost or unreasonably impairing the table's utility. Under section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, a commercial supplier of a product may be liable to any foreseeable plaintiff who was injured by a product that was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to users. In making this determination, many courts have considered one of the principal factors to be whether the product could be modified to make it less dangerous without making it unreasonably expensive or without unreasonably impairing its utility, which is the condition stated in choice (B). (A) is not as good an answer as (B) because the fact that the $\mathrm{x}$-ray table is defective does not establish by itself a breach of the manufacturer's duty. The defect must make the product unreasonably dangerous to users and the defect must have existed when the product left defendant's control for 

\section{TORTS}

defendant to be strictly liable. (C) is wrong because an intermediary's ordinary negligence is not a superseding cause that would relieve the manufacturer from liability. Here, the injury was caused by both the failure of the footrest and the improper tightening of the straps. The latter occurrence is ordinary foreseeable negligence that would not supersede whatever liability Hospital Suppliers is judged to have for the failure of the footrest. (D) is incorrect because the fact that the table was not in the exclusive control of Hospital Suppliers is irrelevant. Exclusive control is a means of showing an element of res ipsa loquitur, a doctrine for proving breach of duty in a negligence action. In a strict products liability action, Hospital Suppliers will be liable for an unreasonably dangerous defective condition as long as the table was expected to, and did in fact, become operational without substantial change in the condition in which it was supplied.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(A) If a hospital employee was negligent in strapping Paul to the table, the hospital is vicariously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. This doctrine imposes liability on an employer for the tortious conduct of its employee occurring within the scope of the employment relationship. Here, strapping Paul to the table was one of the employee's tasks. Since this task was performed negligently and this negligence was one of the causes of Paul's injuries, the hospital would be liable. $(\mathrm{B})$ is wrong because the failure to make a reasonable inspection of the footrest is not the negligent conduct suggested by the facts; rather, it was the failure to strap Paul in securely that probably was negligent. (C) is incorrect because the hospital will be liable even if Paul cannot identify which specific hospital employee was negligent. Through the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, Paul can establish breach of duty just by the fact that Paul fell off the table after he had been strapped in; in other words, an inference of negligence is established because the accident causing his injury is the type that would not normally occur unless someone was negligent. The other two elements required for res ipsa loquitur are that plaintiff was free of fault, which is easy to show in this case, and that the negligence was attributable to the defendant; i.e., that this type of accident ordinarily happens because of the negligence of someone in defendant's position. This requirement often can be satisfied by showing that the instrumentality that caused the injury was in the exclusive control of the defendant. If Paul were suing the nurses or technicians individually, this requirement would prevent him from using res ipsa loquitur in most jurisdictions because he could not establish which individual party was negligent. However, the hospital will be liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior regardless of which of its employees was negligent, because the hospital, through its employees, did have exclusive control over the $x$-ray table. (D) is incorrect because Doctors' Hospital could still lose even if the injury to Paul was caused by a defect present at the time the x-ray table was purchased, if the defect could have been easily discovered through a reasonable inspection.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(B) Mac's is strictly liable to Pedro if Mac's sold a defective tire to Sandra. The question does not indicate what theory Pedro is using in his products liability action, so you should analyze the facts under a strict liability theory because it is the easiest theory for a plaintiff to establish. In a strict liability action based on a defective product, plaintiff must prove that (i) defendant was a commercial supplier owing a strict duty, (ii) the duty was breached because the product was supplied in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to users, (iii) the defect was the actual and proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries, and (iv) plaintiff suffered damages. Here, Mac's is a commercial supplier because it is a retailer of the tires, and therefore owes a strict duty to any user or foreseeable bystander; Pedro need not have purchased the tire from Mac's to recover. If the tire was defective when it was placed into commerce by the manufacturer, it would be unreasonably dangerous, i.e., dangerous beyond the expectation of the ordinary consumer, and Mac's would be in breach of its strict duty by selling it. Pedro can establish actual cause by showing that, but for the defect, the tire would not have suddenly blown out and the car would not have crashed. Proximate cause can be shown even if Sandra, the original purchaser, was negligent in not discovering the defect before selling the car to Pedro, because the negligent failure of an intermediary to discover a defect is not a superseding cause that would cut off the supplier's strict liability. Upon proof of the final element, damages, Pedro can recover from Mac's on a strict liability theory. (A) is incorrect because the fact that the tire blew out for no apparent reason is not sufficient to establish that the tire was defective when it was placed in commerce, which is a necessary element to impose strict liability on commercial suppliers. While the fact that the tire blew out suggests that it may have been defective, Pedro must present some evidence that the blowout was not caused by improper use or maintenance by either Sandra or him. (C) is incorrect because the care taken by Mac's in distributing tires from a reputable manufacturer, while it would be a defense in an action based on negligence, is not a defense in an action based on strict liability. Because strict liability may be one of the theories Pedro is using, $(\mathrm{C})$ is not the best choice. Similarly, (D) is incorrect because even if Pedro's exceeding the speed limit was contributory negligence, it would not be a defense to a strict liability action in a jurisdiction retaining traditional contributory negligence doctrines. The fact that it was widely known in the tire industry that users would exceed posted speed limits indicates that Pedro's misuse of the tires was reasonably foreseeable; hence, it is a type of ordinary negligence that is not a defense in a strict liability action.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(C) The court should deny Gasmask's motion if it determines that Gasmask's storage of chemicals was an abnormally dangerous activity, making Gasmask strictly liable for any harm caused by the chemicals. Canyon City can bring a private nuisance action against Gasmask for the substantial and unreasonable interference with the use of its water. Nuisances may be based on intent, negligence, or strict liability. A strict liability standard for engaging in an ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous activity would apply where the activity (i) involves a risk of serious harm to persons or property; (ii) cannot be performed without risk of serious harm no matter how much care is taken; and (iii) is not a commonly engaged-in activity by persons in the community. Whether an activity is abnormally dangerous is a question of law that the court can decide on a motion for a directed verdict. Since Canyon City has presented no evidence of negligence on Gasmask's part, the only way that Canyon City can survive Gasmask's directed verdict motion is if the court finds that a strict liability standard applies, as suggested by (C). Choice (A) is incorrect. While no evidence of a breach of duty owed in negligence has been shown, Canyon City has presented enough evidence to establish breach of Gasmask's absolute duty to make the storage safe, if the court finds that Gasmask was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity. Canyon City has a cause of action for the breach of duty because its use of the water table adjacent to the storage site makes it a foreseeable plaintiff. (B) is incorrect because the fact that Canyon City drilled its wells after Gasmask stored its chemicals would not bar Canyon City from recovering and would have no effect on Gasmask's motion. This defense, called "coming to the nuisance," is generally rejected by the courts. (D) is incorrect because, as discussed above, whether the elements making an activity abnormally dangerous are present is a question of law for the court rather than a question of fact.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(C) Primrose will prevail because Daffodil's violation of the statute resulted in Primrose's injuries. The applicable standard of care in a negligence action can be established by proving the applicability 

\section{TORTS}

to that action of a statute providing for a criminal penalty. If this is done, the statute's specific duty will replace the more general common law duty of care. For the statutory standard to be applicable, plaintiff must show that (i) he is within the class intended to be protected by the statute, (ii) the statute was designed to prevent the type of harm that the plaintiff suffered, and (iii) the statute clearly defined the standard of conduct expected. Here, the OADA provision applies because Primrose is a minor purchasing a large quantity of model airplane glue, the serious injury he suffered from sniffing the glue was one of the harms that the statute was designed to prevent, and the statute clearly prohibited the transaction that took place between Primrose and Daffodil. The effect of establishing a violation of the statute is that a conclusive presumption of duty and breach of duty is established. Primrose should then be able to establish that Daffodil's sale of the glue was the actual cause and proximate cause of Primrose's injuries, completing the prima facie case of negligence on Daffodil's part. (A) is incorrect because Primrose's assumption of the risk is not a defense under these circumstances. The facts indicate that the state has retained the common law tort defense of assumption of the risk. Under this defense, a plaintiff will be denied recovery in a negligence action if he either expressly or impliedly knew of the risk of injury and voluntarily proceeded in the face of the risk. However, courts refuse to permit an assumption of risk defense in some situations because of public policy considerations. When a statute applies and is enacted to protect a class, members of that class will not be deemed to have assumed any risk. Here, even though Primrose was aware of the danger when he voluntarily sniffed the glue, the statute was enacted to protect minors such as Primrose from the dangers of glue sniffing. Thus, Daffodil cannot rely on assumption of risk as a defense. (B) is incorrect because minors such as Primrose who were experimenting with glue sniffing were a primary target of the OADA provision. (D) is incorrect because the statute does not provide for a reasonable mistake to excuse its violation. If the common law duty of reasonable care were applicable here, the reasonableness of Daffodil's mistake would be relevant. However, the statute's specific duty replaces the more general duty of reasonable care, and violation of a statutory standard will only be excused where compliance would cause more danger than violation or would be beyond defendant's control. Neither situation is indicated here, so the statute applies.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(A) Donald is jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of Pluto's damages that Pluto himself was not responsible for, but can obtain contribution from Mickey in proportion to Mickey's fault. Comparative negligence jurisdictions allow a plaintiff to recover some percentage of his damages even though he was contributorily negligent in causing the accident. "Pure" comparative negligence allows a plaintiff some recovery no matter how great his negligence was. Most comparative negligence jurisdictions retain the doctrine of joint and several liability, which makes each of several tortfeasors liable to the plaintiff for the entire amount of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled. However, if one tortfeasor does have to pay the plaintiff the entire judgment, the rule of contribution allows the paying tortfeasor to recover the excess over his share from the nonpaying tortfeasor. If contribution is based on comparative fault, the nonpaying tortfeasor is required to contribute an amount in proportion to his relative fault. Here, Pluto suffered $\$ 100,000$ in damages but was $30 \%$ at fault, allowing him a net recovery of $\$ 70,000-\$ 100,000$ minus $30 \%(\$ 30,000)$. He can recover the entire $\$ 70,000$ from Donald because the jurisdiction retains the doctrine of joint and several liability. However, under a system of contribution based on comparative fault, Donald can compel Mickey to pay him $\$ 40,000$ as contribution because Mickey was $40 \%$ at fault in causing the $\$ 100,000$ of damages incurred by Pluto. (B) is incorrect. If Donald did only pay $\$ 40,000$ to Pluto, he could compel Mickey to pay $\$ 10,000$ as contribution (because Donald's proportional share of the damages is only $\$ 30,000$ ). However, because Donald is jointly and severally liable, Pluto can collect up to $\$ 70,000$ from him. (C) is incorrect because Donald is liable for more than his proportional share of the damages if the jurisdiction provides for joint and several liability. (D) is incorrect because a pure comparative negligence jurisdiction allows recovery no matter how great plaintiff's negligence is compared with defendant's. (D) probably also would be incorrect in a "partial" comparative negligence jurisdiction that only allows plaintiff to recover if he is less at fault than defendant. Most of these jurisdictions use a "combined comparison" approach when several tortfeasors are involved, comparing plaintiff's negligence with the total negligence of all of the defendants combined. Because Pluto was only $30 \%$ at fault and Donald and Mickey together were $70 \%$ at fault, Pluto could recover against Donald even in a partial comparative negligence jurisdiction.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(C) In the absence of joint and several liability, Donald is liable only for the portion of Pluto's damages for which he was responsible. As discussed in the answer to the preceding question, joint and several liability makes each of several negligent actors liable to the plaintiff for the entire amount of damages to which plaintiff is entitled. Because the jurisdiction has abolished this rule, Donald is liable to Pluto for only $30 \%$ of his damages $(\$ 30,000)$, because Donald was $30 \%$ at fault in causing the accident. (A) is incorrect because the jurisdiction has abolished joint and several liability. Had it been retained, (A) would be correct because common law contribution rules require all tortfeasors to pay equal shares regardless of their respective degrees of fault (i.e., Donald would ultimately have to pay $\$ 35,000$ even though he was only $30 \%$ at fault). (B) is incorrect because Donald is liable only for $\$ 30,000$, because he was only $30 \%$ at fault in causing the accident. (D) is incorrect because, as discussed in the answer to the preceding question, a pure comparative negligence jurisdiction allows recovery no matter how great plaintiff's negligence is when compared with defendant's.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(B) The Journal will be liable if it was negligent as to truth or falsity because the statement was regarding a matter of public concern. Supreme Court decisions based on the First Amendment now impose a fault requirement in defamation cases involving public figures or matters of public concern. Where the defamation involves a matter of public concern but the plaintiff is not a public figure, the plaintiff must show that the defendant permitted the false statement to appear, if not through malice, at least through negligence as to its truth or falsity. Here, the defamatory statement was contained in a newspaper article about a contentious public meeting on a controversial issue; thus, its content, form, and context indicate that a matter of public concern was involved. The other elements required to establish defamation of a private person on a matter of public concern are also present here: the statement was false and defamatory to Carla (given her beliefs), was published in the newspaper, and caused her mental anguish, which is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of actual injury. (A) is incorrect because it is not sufficient for Carla to establish only the elements of common law defamation for her to prevail. Because this statement involves a matter of public concern, she must also show either (i) negligence as to truth or falsity and actual injury, or (ii) actual malice (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity). (C) is incorrect. Carla does not have to show knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to truth or falsity because she is not a public official or public figure. While a person may be deemed a public figure where she voluntarily assumes a central role in a particular public controversy (e.g., a prominent community activist), merely voicing one's opinion at a public meeting does not make one a public figure, even though the matter is one of public concern and the subject of a newspaper article. (D) is incorrect because the qualified privilege for reports of public proceedings only excuses accurate reports of statements that were false when made; it does not excuse inaccuracies in the reporting of statements, which is what happened here.

\section{Question 1}

Oswald owned an old, unoccupied, and extremely run-down building in Hooverville. The walls were unstable and beginning to buckle. Oswald knew of the building's condition, but he did not want to spend the money needed to repair it and hoped that the Hooverville Redevelopment Commission would want his land to build a shopping mall.

Timmy was a driver for U-Pump-It Tanker Lines, a concern that operated tanker trucks that delivered gasoline to filling stations. U-PumpIt's rules required drivers to park only in legally designated parking areas. After completing his deliveries for the day in Hooverville, Timmy stopped for a cup of coffee. He did not want to spend time trying to find a parking place on a side street, so he parked in front of Oswald's building, which was located on a through street. The area in front of Oswald's building was clearly marked, "No Parking At Any Time." Timmy walked to the Emporium Restaurant, where he ordered coffee and the daily special.

Hooverville was located in an area subject to minor earthquake activity. Just as Timmy began his lunch, a quake jolted Hooverville. The quake was not strong enough to cause damage to structurally sound buildings, but was sufficient to cause the walls of Oswald's building to collapse. The building fell on top of the U-Pump-It truck, causing the truck to roll over on its side. Gasoline leaked from the truck and began streaming down the street. Elvira, a pedestrian walking two blocks away, lit a cigarette and casually tossed a match in the street. The stream of gasoline had just reached that street and the match caused the gasoline to ignite. The flames spread to a nearby commercial building. An explosion occurred, causing many windows in a neighboring apartment building to be blown inward. Flying glass was propelled into Bonnie's apartment. Bonnie suffered multiple cuts and a serious eye injury from the flying glass.

Bonnie brings a negligence action against UPump-It Tanker Lines. If the court finds in favor of U-Pump-It, it will be because: (A) The court follows the Cardozo view regarding foreseeable plaintiffs.

(B) Timmy was acting outside the scope of his employment when Bonnie was injured.

(C) Oswald was the legal cause of Bonnie's injuries because his building was in an unreasonably dangerous condition.

(D) The company had a rule against illegal parking on streets.

\section{Question 2}

Olivia and Scarlet were roommates who both attended a prestigious fashion design school. When Olivia had received her acceptance letter from the school, she splurged and purchased a new Scandervan 2001 sewing machine for $\$ 1,000$ so that she would be more than adequately equipped for her design assignments. One day when Olivia was at class, Scarlet loaned Olivia's sewing machine to Violet, whose own machine lacked the fancy options of the Scandervan 2001. Scarlet had loaned Olivia's Scandervan 2001 to other design students on several prior occasions. Unfortunately, Violet, who was not familiar with the delicate Scandervan 2001, caused extensive damage to the machine when she tried to create a cutting edge design by sewing silverware on a dress. It would cost $\$ 400$ to repair the sewing machine.

If Olivia sues Scarlet for the damage Violet caused to the sewing machine, what will be the result?
(A) Olivia will recover $\$ 1,000$.
(B) Olivia will recover the fair market value of the sewing machine.
(C) Olivia will recover $\$ 400$.
(D) Olivia will recover nothing, because Scarlet did not damage the machine and Violet's conduct was not intentional. 

\section{Question 3}

Orbison owned Rockacre, but was badly in need of ready cash. He conveyed Rockacre to Presley, who put the deed in his guitar case and took off for a three-week tour of the Orient. Orbison knew that Presley had left town, and Orbison still found himself strapped for money. He offered to sell Rockacre to Madonna for $\$ 5,000$. Although Madonna had heard Presley say he had bought Rockacre, Madonna thought $\$ 5,000$ was a terrific price for the property. She paid Orbison $\$ 5,000$ and received a deed from him, which she promptly recorded. Madonna subsequently conveyed Rockacre to Fats for $\$ 15,000$. Fats knew nothing about Presley's deed and Fats promptly recorded the deed from Madonna. Two weeks later, upon his return from the Orient, Presley recorded his deed to Rockacre. A month after that, Fats conveyed Rockacre to Chubby for $\$ 17,000$. Chubby knew that Presley held a deed to Rockacre, but paid Fats $\$ 17,000$ anyway. Chubby immediately recorded and filed an appropriate action against Presley and against Fats to determine ownership of Rockacre. Assume that Rockacre is situated in a state with the following statute:

No conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land is valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof whose conveyance is first recorded.

The court will most likely rule that:
(A) Presley has superior rights to both Fats and Chubby.
(B) Fats has superior rights to both Presley and Chubby.
(C) Chubby has superior rights to both Presley and Fats.
(D) Chubby has superior rights to Fats, but Presley has superior rights to Chubby.

\section{Question 4}

In which of the following situations is the offered evidence most likely to be admitted? (A) In Paula's action against David for assault, David offers the testimony of Walter, a surprise witness who, it was just discovered, witnessed the altercation between Paula and David; when questioned by the judge, David's counsel agrees to permit a continuance following Walter's testimony so that Paula will have time to prepare for cross-examination of Walter.

(B) In Peter's negligence action against Dolores arising from an accident in which a 1994 Camaro struck Peter while he crossed Main Street at a crosswalk, Peter offers the testimony of Winchell, the owner of a garage, who will state that Dolores arranged to have the brakes of the subject 1994 Camaro relined and adjusted the day after the accident; Dolores stipulated in her responsive pleadings that she was the owner of the 1994 Camaro.

(C) In Patrick's action for personal injuries against Don arising from a collision between the two while both rode in a bicycle race, Patrick offers a videotape showing a surgeon resetting his broken leg, in which it was necessary to rebreak the leg while Patrick was anesthetized.

(D) In Penelope's defamation action against Delbert, Penelope offers the testimony of Wanda, who will state that when she heard Delbert describe Penelope as "the biggest shyster in Middleville," she understood him to mean that Penelope was an incompetent lawyer; Wanda is the eleventh person Penelope has called to interpret the quoted statement.

\section{Question 5}

Twin Falls has a city ordinance that makes it unlawful for any group of individuals or organizations in excess of 20 persons to demonstrate, march, or picket in the city's civic center without first posting a bond with the police department and receiving a permit. The permit procedure takes at least one working day, and a "parade" permit costs $\$ 10$. The requirement for a license is that each demonstration in excess of 20 persons have one parade marshal for each 20 persons who must be responsible for insuring that the demonstration remains on the city sidewalks, does not block traffic, and does not become noisy or unruly. The ordinance, in addition to making a violation a misdemeanor, authorizes the police department to terminate any demonstration if "any person in the demonstration, without provocation, uses, in the presence of other persons not a party to the demonstration, annoying, disturbing, opprobrious words and abusive language in such a manner as tending to cause a breach of the peace."

YAAF (the Young Americans Against Fascism) brings suit in the state court to enjoin the city from preventing their scheduled demonstration on Memorial Day without a permit, and to enjoin the city from using this ordinance to require them to have a permit.

YAAF's strongest contention for finding the provisions of this statute unconstitutional is that:

(A) The city's civic center is a place where demonstrations of this type normally occur, and the city cannot prevent citizens from demonstrating there.

(B) There is no showing by the city that YAAF's demonstrators are likely to become disruptive or unruly.

(C) The ordinance is overbroad and unduly vague.

(D) The First and Fourteenth Amendments ensure the right of association in public places without interference.

\section{Question 6}

Carol owed June $\$ 90,000$, which was due on January 1. On January 15, Carol offered to pay June $\$ 80,000$ if June would agree to accept the amount in full satisfaction of the $\$ 90,000$ debt. June agreed and Carol paid $\$ 80,000$ to June.

If June then sues Carol for $\$ 10,000$, June will: (A) Win, because Carol had an obligation to pay $\$ 90,000$ on January 1.

(B) Lose, because of June's agreement to accept $\$ 80,000$.

(C) Lose, because there was an accord and satisfaction.

(D) Lose, because June agreed to the $\$ 80,000$ after the January 1 due date.

\section{Question 7}

Parafun, Inc. manufactured and sold parachutes for use by sport skydivers. The corporation's product development committee selected a design for a parachute submitted by Silk, one of Parafun's three professional designers. The chute was placed on the market, with the warning, "This parachute should be discarded after 150 jumps." Parafun's market researchers had established that the usual practice among sport skydivers was to discard a parachute after 100 jumps.

After the design had been approved and the product was successfully manufactured and marketed, Silk took several of the parachutes to an independent stress analysis laboratory. The scientists tested the chutes and concluded that there was a $1 \%$ failure rate on the chutes for jumps 100 through 150 , because the center of the parachute might tend to collapse because of a design defect. Silk did not report this problem to his superiors at Parafun, because he feared he would be fired.

Several months after Silk received the testing report, Airborne, a sport skydiver, used one of the chutes designed by Silk and manufactured and sold by Parafun. Airborne's use was the 115 th jump for the chute. When Airborne leaped from the airplane, the chute opened properly, but halfway down, the center of the chute collapsed inward. Airborne hurtled to the ground to his death. An investigation established that Silk knew of the design defect.

If Parafun is charged with manslaughter in a common law jurisdiction, the verdict should be: 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

(A) Guilty, because Silk was Parafun's employee and he designed the instrumentality of death.

(B) Guilty, because Airborne died as a result of the failure of a product manufactured and sold by Parafun.

(C) Not guilty, because a corporation cannot be found guilty of manslaughter.

(D) Not guilty, because there was only a $1 \%$ chance of parachute failure.

\section{Question 8}

Just before going on an expedition to the Amazon, Farley gave his brother, Milton, a power of attorney to sell his house, which stated:

My brother, Milton, is specifically empowered to sell and convey all, or any part, of the real property owned by me as of this date.

Several weeks later, Milton sold Farley's house to Glenda and conveyed to her a customary deed containing covenants of title. A year later, when Farley returned from the expedition, he was served with a complaint by Glenda, who was suing him for breach of covenant because it turned out that Farley's former wife owns onehalf the house that Milton had sold on behalf of his brother.

In this suit, Glenda should:

(A) Prevail, because Farley, through his attorney-in-fact, Milton, had covenanted with regard to the title of the property.

(B) Prevail, if in fact Farley's former wife has filed a claim against Glenda for her interest in the house.

(C) Not prevail, unless the power to "sell and convey" is construed to include the power to execute a usual form of deed used to convey real property. (D) Not prevail, because Farley did not make any specific covenants with regard to the sale of this house.

\section{Question 9}

Patrice sued David on a breach of contract theory. Winston testified for Patrice. On crossexamination, which of the following questions is the trial judge most likely to rule improper?

(A) "Weren't you convicted last year of forgery?"

(B) "Isn't it true that you and Patrice have been best friends for many years?"

(C) "Isn't it true that you are known in the community as an alcoholic?"'

(D) "Didn't you cheat your business partner out of a large amount of money last month?'

\section{Question 10}

Arthur's hobby was restoring classic cars, and he frequently attended shows at which people with similar interests would gather to display their handiwork, compare techniques and information, and view products of manufacturers who catered to such hobbyists. At one such show, Arthur was examining a 1947 Pontiac "Stretch" Roadster when the owner, who was standing nearby, indicated that he was trying to sell the car. Bud, who stated that he had restored the Pontiac himself, told Arthur that (I) the car was restored using nothing but genuine Pontiac parts or parts that Bud had handmade himself. He said that (II) "this is the finest restoration of a 1947 'Stretch' Roadster in the United States, and one of the two best in the world."' As they were discussing price, Bud pointed out that (III) "this car has the original 'rearing horse' grille that was installed by the dealer on 1947 'Stretch' Roadsters." Arthur agreed to purchase the car for a considerable sum, and had it transported to his home. Later, he discovered that Bud had not been entirely truthful about the restoration. In his action for deceit, Arthur establishes that Bud knew, when he made statements I, II, and III, above, that each was false. Assuming that all the other elements of deceit are proven, which of the three statements will support Arthur's claims?
(A) I only.
(B) I and II.
(C) I and III.
(D) I, II, and III.

\section{Question 11}

Astro developed a new synthetic liquid that could safely double the output of electrical power plants. He built a manufacturing plant unlike any other in the world capable of producing this liquid. A byproduct of the production of the liquid was a hazardous chemical that was not biodegradable in the environment. Astro buried the waste chemical in a depression on his land. Before doing so, Astro secured expert opinion, based on soil analysis, that led him reasonably to believe that the earth beneath the disposal site was impermeable, and that there was no danger of contaminating the underground waters. The chemical, nonetheless, seeped through the underlying soil strata, and was carried by the flow of percolating water to a well used by Herder to water his sheep, which he raised on an adjacent property. The chemical rendered the water in the well unfit for consumption by sheep.

If Herder's sheep were harmed by drinking from the contaminated well, and Herder asserts a claim against Astro for damages to the sheep, which of the following facts, if established, would best aid Astro's case? Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules.

(A) Many companies converted their power plants so that they could utilize the synthetic liquid developed by Astro.

(B) Herder did not do what a reasonable person would have done to prevent harm to his sheep after he learned that the well was contaminated. (C) If he had exercised ordinary care, Herder would have discovered the contamination before his sheep were harmed.

(D) Astro's plant was in place and in operation before Herder purchased his property.

\section{Question 12}

The legislature of the state of Westcoast enacted a statute authorizing all state agencies having legal departments or employing lawyers to subscribe to a computerized legal research service provided by LawComp, Inc. A contract was duly entered into between the state and the corporation. Before LawComp could begin installation of the necessary equipment in state offices, it was revealed that Westcoast's state university system had exhausted its budgeted resources and would not be able to operate without additional money. The legislature then repealed the statute authorizing use of the computer legal service and allocated the funds thereby released to the university.

LawComp brings an action against the state to enforce the contract. The trial court should rule that the statute repealing authorization for LawComp's services is:
(A) Invalid, because it violates the constitu- tional prohibition against impairment of contracts.
(B) Valid, because the legislature has constitu- tional power to repeal its own enactments.
(C) Invalid, because the state is equitably estopped to renounce a valid bid it has accepted.
(D) Valid, because the sovereign may not constitutionally be sued without its own consent.

\section{Question 13}

As Sandra, a newspaper reporter, was walking to her home, she saw undercover officer Cole chasing Tim. Cole yelled, "Don't let him get away. I'm a police officer and he's just mugged a man!" Sandra immediately put out her leg and tripped Tim. When Tim fell, he broke his glasses and badly gashed his cheek.

If Sandra was sued by Tim for battery, she would have:

(A) No valid defense unless she had other reasons to believe Cole was a police officer besides his statement.

(B) A valid defense if Sandra believed that Cole had grounds to arrest Tim.

(C) A valid defense if she actually witnessed the crime.

(D) No valid defense if a felony had not in fact been committed.

\section{Question 14}

The citizenry of East Rabbit's Foot had experienced a tremendous increase in the incidence of begging in the downtown area. In response, the city council enacted an ordinance that required anyone soliciting for charitable contributions of any sort in any public place to wear an identity card issued by the local police department. Identity cards could be obtained by filling out an affidavit providing identification and address information about the applicant and further affirming that the applicant was not soliciting for personal use and belonged to a recognized charitable organization.

George, a member of Airbreathers Against Tobacco ("AAT"), wishes to solicit contributions by similarly minded persons for use in his organization's campaign against public smoking. He does not want to comply with the identity card ordinance. He comes to you for legal advice and asks the advisability of challenging the ordinance in federal court.

You should inform George that the ordinance is probably:

(A) Unconstitutional, because it violates the First Amendment's prohibition of government infringement of the right of free speech. (B) Unconstitutional, because it prevents religious organizations from obtaining contributions from their members, and thus interferes with the free exercise of religion.

(C) Constitutional, because it represents a reasonable balancing of the state's police power interest in protecting its citizens from fraud and annoyance against the right of people to seek charitable contributions.

(D) Constitutional, because preventing fraud in the solicitation for charitable contributions is a compelling interest.

\section{Question 15}

Marty was driving his auto on a public street of Duffyville on his way home from a party. His wife, Dolly, occupied the passenger seat. Two police officers, Dragby and Casey, noticed that Marty's car was weaving and generally being driven in an erratic manner. They pursued the vehicle and curbed it. When Marty emerged from the driver's seat, he was obviously inebriated, and the officers wrote out a drunk driving citation, and insisted that Marty accompany them to the station house. Marty accompanied Casey in the squad car, and Dragby drove Marty's car to the local precinct with Dolly in the passenger seat. Dolly walked into the station house with Marty.

As Marty was being booked, Dragby took a standard police search form with him and began searching the car. Beneath the passenger seat he found Dolly's purse. He opened the purse and found a plastic zip-lock bag containing a small amount of marijuana. Dolly was charged with possession of drugs. At Dolly's trial, her attorney moved to suppress the admission of the marijuana seized from Dolly's purse into evidence.

Should the court rule favorably on the motion?

(A) Yes, because when conducting a search incident to an arrest the police may not open a closed container. (B) Yes, because the police lacked probable cause to search Dolly's purse.

(C) No, because the search was incident to the lawful arrest of Marty.

(D) No, because the marijuana was discovered during the course of a valid inventory search.

Questions 16-17 are based on the following fact situation:

Sam was a famous auto racer and builder of racing cars. He and Bob signed a contract for sale of one of Sam's hand-built race cars for $\$ 25,000$, the price to be paid and the car to be delivered one week later.

The day after the contract was signed, Sam called Bob and told him that Sam's wife, Winnie, who had a half interest in the race car, would not go along with the sale at $\$ 25,000$. Winnie would agree to a sale for $\$ 40,000$.

16. If Winnie in fact has a half interest in the racing car:

(A) There is no enforceable contract because the car cannot be sold unless both owners convey title.

(B) There is an enforceable contract only if Bob was unaware of Winnie's interest when he signed with Sam.

(C) There is an enforceable contract regardless of whether Bob was aware of Winnie's interest at the time he signed.

(D) The contract is discharged by prospective inability of performance.

17. Assume for purposes of this question only that there was an enforceable contract between Sam and Bob. Bob fails to tender $\$ 25,000$ to Sam on the date set for delivery and Sam does not deliver the car. On these facts:
(A) Sam can recover from Bob for breach of contract.
(B) Bob can recover from Sam for breach of contract.
(C) Neither can recover until one of the parties tenders performance.
(D) The contract is terminated.

\section{Question 18}

When she died, Clara left a valid holographic will that contained the following provision:

I want my only child, Truman, to have my house when I die and to live there as long as he wants. After that, I want it to go to my grandchildren.

At the time of Clara's death, Truman was married to Dina, and they had a married son, Sam. Both Truman and Dina moved into the house, but about six months later, they separated and Dina moved out.

The following year, Truman and Sam were involved in an airplane crash in which Truman was immediately killed. Several weeks later, Sam died, leaving his young widow, Tanya. Dina brings a suit against Tanya claiming an interest in the house as Truman's widow. There is no statute in this jurisdiction that governs the issue of the right of an estranged spouse to inherit property from a decedent spouse, but if Truman is found to own property at the time of his death, it is possible that Dina could inherit one-half as his surviving spouse.

In this suit, Dina should most likely:

(A) Prevail, because Clara's will gave Truman a fee simple interest in the property.

(B) Prevail, because the devise to Clara's grandchildren in her will is invalid as it violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.

(C) Not prevail, because Sam had a vested remainder interest subject to open, which became indefeasibly vested. 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

(D) Not prevail, because Sam had a contingent remainder interest by reason of Clara's will, and the contingency occurred.

\section{Question 19}

Prole was the chief operating officer of the Squidco Division of Octopus Corp., a privately held manufacturing and marketing firm. The Squidco plant was the major employer in Middletown, and Prole was a respected figure with a good reputation in the community. He served on the boards of several Middletown charities and was otherwise active in civic activities.

Prole was suddenly fired by Dante, the executive vice president of Octopus Corp., prompting rumors about the financial health of Squidco. A reporter from the Middletown Herald interviewed Dante, and asked Dante why Prole had been dismissed. Dante said: "Prole was fired because Prole was a bad manager and Squidco Division lost money because of Prole's stewardship." Dante's statement was printed in the Middletown Herald, and was picked up by business-oriented publications.

If Prole sues the Middletown Herald for defamation, which of the following statements with regard to damages is correct?
(A) To prevail, Prole must plead and prove pecuniary damages, such as an inability to find a position with another company.
(B) To prevail, Prole must show evidence of actual injury, such as mental distress.
(C) Damages are presumed because the written repetition of a slander is characterized as libel.
(D) Damages are presumed if Prole is not deemed to be a public figure.

\section{Question 20}

In a medical malpractice action, Dr. Zorba was called as an expert witness by the plaintiff and testified that the surgical procedure utilized by the defendant was so new and experimental as to constitute negligence under the accepted standard of practice in the relevant medical community. On cross-examination by defendant's counsel, the following occurred: Counsel: "Dr. Zorba, is Modern Surgical Procedures by Weston a reliable authority in your area of specialty?" Dr. Zorba: "Yes." Counsel: "Did you rely upon the treatise in reaching the conclusion that my client was negligent?" Dr. Zorba: "I did not." Defense counsel now proposes to read a passage from the treatise stating that the surgical procedure at issue is widely accepted by responsible medical practitioners. Plaintiff's counsel objects.

How should the court rule?

(A) For defendant, but it should also caution the jury that the evidence may only be considered in impeachment of Dr. Zorba.

(B) For defendant.

(C) For plaintiff, because Dr. Zorba did not rely upon the treatise in forming his expert opinion.

(D) For plaintiff, because the passage from the treatise is inadmissible hearsay.

\section{Question 21}

Congress enacted a law requiring all civil service employees to retire at age 75 , except when such employees are employed by the armed services. Civil service employees of the armed services are required to retire at age 65 . Portman is an employee of the Department of the Army; he is 65 years old. He files suit in the federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that would prevent the Army from requiring him to retire before age 75 .

Portman's strongest argument in support of his contention that the statute's provisions regarding civil service employees of the armed services are invalid is that this provision:

(A) Denies him the privileges and immunities of national citizenship. (B) Denies him a property right without just compensation.

(C) Is invidious discrimination on the basis of age in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

(D) Is not within the enumerated powers of Congress under Article I, Section 8.

\section{Question 22}

Velma entered into an argument with her neighbor Diana over the height of the bushes on Velma's property. Diana claimed that the bushes were so high that when she attempted to pull out of her own driveway, she was unable to see if traffic was approaching from the south. Diana demanded that Velma cut the bushes down to half their present height. When Velma refused, Diana, in a fit of anger, slapped Velma. Velma reached into her purse, drew out a pistol, and fired a shot at Diana but missed. Just as Velma cocked the pistol to fire another shot, Diana grabbed a shovel and hit Velma over the head, killing her instantly. Diana was charged with the murder of Velma. At trial, Diana testified that she hit Velma because she believed that Velma would have shot and killed her if she did not.

If the jury believes Diana, it should find her:

(A) Guilty of murder, because she did not retreat.

(B) Guilty of murder, because she was the original aggressor in the encounter and had not withdrawn.

(C) Not guilty of murder, because Velma was the first to resort to deadly force.

(D) Not guilty of murder, because she had no opportunity to premeditate.

\section{Question 23}

Alpha gratuitously conveyed his interest in Greekacre to Beta by quitclaim deed. Beta promptly recorded. Six months later, Alpha conveyed his interest in Greekacre to Gamma for $\$ 50,000$. Alpha gave Gamma a warranty deed, which Gamma promptly recorded. As between Beta and Gamma, who has the superior right to title to Greekacre?

(A) Beta, regardless of the type of recording statute.

(B) Gamma, regardless of the type of recording statute.

(C) Beta, because she recorded prior to Gamma recording.

(D) Gamma, because he took by warranty deed rather than quitclaim deed.

\section{Question 24}

Daisy is on trial for fraud. One item of critical evidence in this trial is a check for $\$ 10,000$ that purportedly was signed by her. Daisy has denied that she signed the check in question. The prosecutor calls Julius, the landlord of the apartment building in which Daisy resided for three months before her arrest. Julius intends to testify that it is Daisy's signature on the check, and he bases his opinion of the authenticity of her signature on the ground that he saw her sign the lease to his apartment.

The trial court should find this testimony:

(A) Admissible, because there was only a short period of time between when Julius saw her sign the lease and the time of trial.

(B) Admissible, because any lay person can testify to the authenticity of another's signature, if that witness has previously seen that person's signature.

(C) Inadmissible, because Julius has only seen the signature once and is not acting as a handwriting expert.

(D) Inadmissible, because the testimony is inherently unreliable.

\section{Question 25}

After a bomb explosion in an airport locker, Detective Jones received some information from 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

Carlos, an informant who had given him reliable information several times in the past, that Karl was a member of a radical group that took credit for the bombing. Carlos told Jones that, three months before, he had been in Karl's apartment and on that occasion had seen what appeared to be some sticks of dynamite. Reasonably believing that Carlos's information established probable cause, Jones prepared an affidavit for a search warrant. After the warrant was issued, Jones and a group of police raided Karl's apartment. No evidence connecting Karl with the bombing was discovered, but in the search of his apartment the police discovered several grams of cocaine.

At his trial for possession of narcotics, Karl's motion to suppress the evidence would probably be:

(A) Denied, because Carlos was a reliable informant and Jones reasonably believed that Carlos's information was accurate and that the warrant was properly issued.

(B) Granted, because in fact the police did not discover any evidence linking Karl to the bombings and, therefore, the seizure of the cocaine was fruit of the poisonous tree.

(C) Granted, if the court determines that the information supplied by Carlos to Jones concerned information too remote in time to justify a claim of probable cause at the time Jones requested the search warrant.

(D) Granted, because the search warrant was not issued for the purpose of searching Karl's apartment for illegal drugs.

\section{Question 26}

The state of Alpine has a Fair Employment Act that provides a remedy for victims of employment discrimination. The Act requires complainants to bring charges before the Alpine Fair Employment Commission within 180 days of the occurrence of alleged unlawful employment practices. The Commission then has 120 days to convene a factfinding conference to obtain evidence, ascertain the parties' positions, and explore settlement possibilities. Larson was discharged from his job with Widget Corp. purportedly because of a physical handicap unrelated to his ability to perform his job. Larson filed a timely complaint, alleging unlawful termination of employment, as required by the statute. However, through inadvertence, the Commission scheduled the factfinding conference for a date five days after expiration of the 120 -day statutory period. At the conference, Widget moved that the charge be dismissed for lack of a timely conference. The Commission denied the motion. Widget petitioned the Alpine Supreme Court. The court held for Widget, stating that the failure to comply with the 120 day requirement deprived the Commission of jurisdiction to consider Larson's charge. On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, Larson argues that his right to due process will be violated if the Commission's error is allowed to extinguish his cause of action.

Which of the following best describes the viability of Larson's due process claim?
(A) The claim fails, because Larson had no protected property interest in his job.
(B) The claim fails, because the Alpine legisla- ture, having conferred on claimants a remedy for claims of unfair employment practices, has the prerogative to establish limiting procedures for such claims.
(C) The claim succeeds, because Larson had a protected property interest in the remedy.
(D) The claim succeeds, because of the funda- mental unfairness of leaving Larson with- out a remedy.

\section{Question 27}

Deborah was at work when her husband called her and said, "You lazy procrastinator, you were supposed to be working in the front yard this weekend while I did the backyard. Ned just tripped over those roots I told you to take out. He's really been badly hurt and I'll bet he sues us for all we're worth." Deborah then told her secretary, Walter, "Ned just got hurt because 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS 149.}

I forgot to do my yard work." On returning home, however, Deborah discovered that Ned had tripped over roots from his own tree in his own yard. Ned disagreed and sued Deborah and her husband. At trial, Ned called Walter to testify as to Deborah's statement to him.

Walter's testimony will be:
(A) Excluded, because Deborah had no first- hand information when she made her statement to Walter.
(B) Excluded, because it is inadmissible lay opinion.
(C) Admitted, because it is not hearsay.
(D) Admitted to impeach Deborah's expected testimony as to the result of her own investigation.

\section{Question 28}

The legislature of State Red recently enacted a statute that defined first degree murder as murder with premeditation and deliberation, or a homicide in the commission of arson, rape, robbery, burglary, or kidnapping. The statute defined second degree murder as all other murder at common law.

In which of the following situations is defendant most likely to be guilty of first degree murder?

(A) Believing that his neighbor, Paul, had stolen his lawn mower, defendant walked over to his neighbor's house and punched him in the nose, intending to injure him. As a result of the blow, Paul fell back, hit his head, and died.

(B) After leaving a bar in a highly intoxicated state, defendant attempted to drive home. While so doing, he struck Oscar, who was legally crossing the street in a marked crosswalk. Oscar died instantly.

(C) Infuriated over having caught Mary having an affair with defendant's husband, defendant bought a shotgun and shot and killed Mary as she was leaving her house on her way to work.

(D) Immediately after being punched by Betty, defendant in a rage took a knife and stabbed and killed Betty.

\section{Question 29}

Filmont designed and constructed a playground for children. Shortly thereafter, Filmont dedicated the property to the city of Oakville, to be used as a public park. Ken, a 10-year-old resident of Oakville, was playing at the park when he fell off the monkey bars, breaking his leg. On his behalf, Ken's parents filed suit against Filmont and Oakville, on the grounds of negligence in the design of the monkey bars. At the trial, Filmont was granted a directed verdict, because Oakville now owns the park. Ken's parents appealed the granting of the directed verdict as to Filmont.

The appellate court will most likely hold that:

(A) The decision to grant the directed verdict should be upheld, because Filmont was relieved of liability when he dedicated the park to Oakville.

(B) The decision to grant the directed verdict should be upheld, because Filmont designed and constructed the park in the public interest.

(C) The decision to grant the directed verdict should be overturned if plaintiffs introduced evidence that Filmont dedicated the park to Oakville in an effort to avoid liability for the park's negligent design.

(D) The decision to grant the directed verdict should be overturned, because Filmont's liability for negligence was not affected by the dedication of the park to Oakville.

\section{Question 30}

Drew was tried for the July 21 murder of Victor. Drew called Warren to testify to an alibi. On cross-examination of Warren, the prosecutor 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

asked, "Weren't you on the jury that acquitted Drew of another criminal charge?"'

The best reason for sustaining an objection to this question is that:
(A) The question goes beyond the scope of direct examination.
(B) The probative value of the answer would be substantially outweighed by its tendency to mislead.
(C) The question is a leading question.
(D) Prior jury service in a case involving a party renders the witness incompetent.

Questions 31-32 are based on the following fact situation:

Mary's doctor informed her that she had a rare blood disease that was almost always fatal. He further informed her that there was no treatment known to medical science for this disease. Out of desperation, Mary consulted Quack, who claimed to have a cure for the blood disease. Mary entered into an agreement with Quack under which Quack promised to treat Mary for the blood disease. However, no price was given for the treatment. After two months of treatment, Mary did not appear to have improved at all. Mary's father, Stu, went to see Quack and told Quack that if Quack would cure Mary of the blood disease, Stu would pay Quack $\$ 25,000$. Four months later, after weekly sessions with Quack, Mary again went to see her doctor. This time her doctor told her that she appeared to have recovered completely from the blood disease, because all tests for the disease proved negative; and that, in his opinion, she was completely cured.

31. Assume for the purposes of this question only that Mary refused to pay Quack anything. Quack brings suit against Mary for services rendered. Quack will:

(A) Recover whatever amount Quack shows is his normal fee for the treatment. (B) Recover a reasonable price for his services.

(C) Not recover, because no price term was contained in the original contract.

(D) Not recover, because Quack cannot prove that he was the cause of Mary's recovery.

32. Assume for the purposes of this question only that Stu refuses to pay Quack the $\$ 25,000$. Quack brings suit against Stu. Quack will:

(A) Recover nothing, because Stu's promise constituted no legal detriment to him.

(B) Recover nothing, because Quack had a preexisting duty to Mary under their prior agreement.

(C) Recover the reasonable value of his services, because they are less than $\$ 25,000$.

(D) Recover $\$ 25,000$, because Stu was bargaining for Mary's recovery.

\section{Question 33}

The state of West Dakota has the following statute:

No conveyance or mortgage of an interest in land is valid against any subsequent purchaser for value without notice thereof whose conveyance is first recorded.

Judy, a West Dakota resident, owned several parcels of land there, including Steppeacre. Judy conveyed Steppeacre to Keith. Keith placed the deed in a safe deposit box but did not record the instrument before departing on an extended visit to Adak, a chic resort island in the Aleutian chain. Six months after Keith departed, Judy conveyed Steppeacre to Clyde, who promptly recorded his deed. Clyde had heard from several sources that Judy had sold Steppeacre to Keith, but he was sure that Judy would not sell him property she had already sold to someone else.

Six months after Clyde took possession of Steppeacre, Keith returned from Adak, tanned and rested. When he went to visit Steppeacre he found Clyde there.

Keith now sues Clyde in ejectment. Who owns Steppeacre?

(A) Keith, because his deed from Judy came earlier than Clyde's.

(B) Clyde, because he recorded first.

(C) Keith, because Clyde is not protected by the recording act.

(D) Clyde, because his recording cured any possible defect of his knowing of the earlier sale.

\section{Question 34}

State Blue has a statute making it a crime to operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated. State Blue has another statute providing that a blood alcohol level of 10 raises a presumption of intoxication. State Blue police spotted Billy Bob's pickup weaving from lane to lane on the highway and they stopped the truck. Billy Bob took a breathalyzer test that indicated a $.12$ blood alcohol level, and so Billy Bob was charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated.

At trial, at the close of all the evidence, and over Billy Bob's objection, the judge instructed the jury: "If you are convinced that, at the time Billy Bob was pulled over, his blood alcohol level was 10 or greater, you must presume that he was intoxicated."

Billy Bob was convicted, and he is appealing on the ground that the judge's instruction was improper. The appellate court should:

(A) Affirm, because the judge may instruct the jury on the law, and he merely cited the state statute. (B) Reverse and remand, because the jury should have been left to draw its own conclusion without the judge's instruction.

(C) Reverse and remand, because the presumption might lead the jury to believe that the prosecution did not have to meet its burden of proving Billy Bob guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

(D) Reverse and remand, because the instruction was substantially more prejudicial than probative.

\section{Question 35}

Capitol City, West Carolina, has a city ordinance that prohibits the distribution of pamphlets "on public sidewalks or other public areas when foot traffic is sufficiently heavy and the manner of distribution of the pamphlets causes obstruction of the foot traffic so as to result in spillover onto public streets where vehicular traffic creates a danger to human life."' The West Carolina state fair is held at fairgrounds whose entrances lie along a busy multilane street. Roger, who was distributing pamphlets advocating repeal of the federal milk price support program during Dairy Day at the state fair, attracted a crowd of about 10 farmers and children outside the fairgrounds entrance at which he stood, but most of the few fairgoers entering the fair at that late afternoon time simply ignored him. When one of the dairy farmers became irate and threatened to "knock his block off," Roger was arrested by a fair security guard and subsequently prosecuted under the city ordinance.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the city ordinance and Roger's prosecution?
(A) The ordinance is void on its face and void as applied to Roger.
(B) The ordinance is valid on its face but void as applied to Roger.
(C) The ordinance is valid on its face and valid as applied to Roger. 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

(D) The ordinance is void on its face but valid as applied to Roger.

\section{Question 36}

Woody is on trial for embezzlement. He does not take the stand. Which of Woody's previous convictions is most likely to be admitted into evidence against him?
(A) A 7-year-old conviction for arson, a felony.
(B) A 12-year-old conviction for embezzle- ment, a felony.
(C) A 6-month-old conviction for disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor.
(D) A 2-year-old conviction for felonious sexual assault.

\section{Question 37}

Cyrus and Myrtle are adjoining landowners. On Myrtle's property there is a natural freshwater spring. Cyrus asked Myrtle if it would be possible to build an irrigation ditch from the spring to his property in order to provide water for his cattle. Since the spring supplied more than enough water to meet Myrtle's needs, she agreed, provided that Cyrus construct the ditch in such a manner that it would need the least maintenance possible, because Myrtle did not wish to be continually bothered by Cyrus's coming on her land. Cyrus constructed a concrete irrigation ditch from the spring to the land. The cost of construction of the ditch was $\$ 25,000$. The only maintenance required on the ditch was a semiannual cleaning. Three years later, Myrtle informed Cyrus that her water needs had increased and that she could no longer allow Cyrus to take water from the spring. In addition, Myrtle did not allow Cyrus on her land to do the semiannual cleaning, resulting in the blocking of the ditch.

Cyrus wishes to keep water flowing through the irrigation ditch to his land. Which of the following would be his strongest argument? (A) Cyrus owns a valid easement appurtenant to Myrtle's property.

(B) Because Myrtle has allowed Cyrus to construct the irrigation ditch, Myrtle would be estopped from preventing Cyrus from coming onto her land.

(C) Cyrus, although a licensee, has expended such a substantial sum of money in constructing the irrigation ditch that Myrtle may not terminate Cyrus's license now.

(D) Cyrus, although a licensee, may continue to enter Myrtle's property to clean and maintain the ditch until he is able to acquire another source of water.

\section{Question 38}

Delbert had his laptop computer stolen from his office during a recent holiday weekend. He went to Alice's computer resale shop to find a replacement and saw what he mistakenly thought was his computer. He questioned Alice, who told him that someone had just sold her the computer a few days ago, but she refused to give him any information on the seller and would not let him inspect it more closely. That night, after the shop was closed, Delbert forced open the back door and took the computer. Alice's clerk, who lived in an apartment above the shop, heard someone breaking in and called the police. Delbert was apprehended a block away from the building.

If Delbert is charged with burglary in a jurisdiction retaining the common law criminal offenses, which of the following facts will be most relevant in determining his guilt or innocence?
(A) His mistake as to the identity of the com- puter was not reasonable.
(B) He was unaware that there was an apart- ment above the shop and did not believe that anyone lived in the building.
(C) He realized that the computer was not his before he carried it out.
(D) None of the above facts are relevant. 

\section{Question 39}

Seth owned Slateacre, a rental property in Rock City that generated steady income. After Seth's second child was born, Seth properly executed a will containing the following disposition of Slateacre: "To Truman in trust to pay the educational expenses of my children, but if any of them do not graduate from Rockville University by the age of 30 , then for the benefit of Rockville University's scholarship fund for residents of Rock City." When Seth died, he had three children, all preschoolers. The jurisdiction in which the parties and property are located retains the common law Rule Against Perpetuities.

Is the gift in trust to Rockville University valid?

(A) Yes, because the gift is a valid charitable trust.

(B) Yes, because the doctrine of cy pres is applicable.

(C) No, because the gift is not for a valid charitable purpose.

(D) No, because the gift violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.

\section{Question 40}

Harriet observed an automobile accident that took place across the street from her house. She noticed at the time that the green car, which was driven by Def, did not come to a complete stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection to strike the yellow car driven by Plee after Plee's car had already entered the intersection. Plee sued Def for damages and injuries, but the trial did not take place until almost three years after the accident. Plee wanted Harriet to testify on his behalf against Def, but Harriet's recollection of the accident was very fuzzy. The night before she was scheduled to testify, Harriet consulted her diary, in which Harriet had noted that Def's car ran the stop sign and entered the intersection after Plee's car was already in the intersection. Plee's attorney called Harriet to the stand, and she testified regarding Def's failure to observe the stop sign and Def's entrance into the intersection after Plee.

On cross-examination, Def's attorney asked Harriet if she had consulted any materials to prepare for her testimony. Harriet admitted that her recollection of the accident had been fuzzy and that she had consulted her diary the night before her testimony. Def's attorney immediately moved that Harriet's testimony be stricken from the record.

The court should rule that:

(A) Harriet's testimony is admissible if, after reviewing her notes, she had an independent recollection of the event.

(B) Harriet's testimony is admissible, because the contents of her diary are protected under the work product rule.

(C) Harriet's testimony should be stricken, because her diary was not made available to the opposing party prior to trial.

(D) Harriet's testimony should be stricken, because it is not the best evidence.

\section{Question 41}

In which of the following situations is the defendant most likely to be convicted of burglary?

(A) Unreasonably mistaking Walter's briefcase for his own, Defendant removes the briefcase from Walter's office and takes it home, placing it in his hall closet.

(B) Believing that it is not illegal to take a relative's property, Defendant enters his brother's home through an unlocked door while his brother is sleeping and takes his $\$ 2,000$ television set. Defendant later sells the set at a flea market. 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

(C) When Leon refuses to pay back the $\$ 25$ he borrowed from Defendant two weeks ago, Defendant enters Leon's apartment and removes $\$ 25$ from his wallet, believing that he is recouping the loan.

\section{Question 42}

Owens owned Goldacre in fee simple. In 1985, Owens executed a deed conveying Goldacre "to Private School for the life of my wife Wilma, and then to my children, their heirs and assigns, in equal share, provided, however, that School shall use the premises for educational purposes only." School then erected a temporary building on Goldacre and conducted certain classes within the building. In 2000 , one of School's former students informed the principal of School that a geological survey of the area had indicated that there were valuable minerals beneath the surface of Goldacre. School, badly in need of money, granted to Mine Co. a right to remove the minerals from a one-acre portion of Goldacre upon the payment of a percentage of the value of the minerals removed. From 2000 to 2004, Mine Co. conducted mining operations on the one-acre portion of Goldacre. School had continued to conduct classes in the temporary building located on Goldacre. In 2004, while Owens and Wilma were still alive, both of Owens's children filed suit against School and Mine Co. seeking damages for the removal of minerals since 2000 , an injunction preventing further acts of removal, and all other appropriate remedies.

Which of the following would be the most likely result?

(A) School and Mine Co. should be enjoined, and damages should be recovered, but impounded for future distribution.

(B) The children should succeed, because the interest of School terminated with the first removal of minerals from Goldacre. (C) The injunction should be granted, but damages should be denied because Owens and Wilma are not parties to the action.

(D) Damages should be awarded, but the injunction should be denied.

\section{Question 43}

Moss, a state legislator, was the chairman of a committee that disbursed funds to schools in the state for various projects. A portion of the funds that were used were received from the federal government as part of a federal revenue sharing plan. Moss was charged with a violation of federal law when he and his committee made a $\$ 10,000$ grant for textbooks to a private school for whites only. Moss's defense is that his action as chairman of this committee was in the course of his legislative duties, and thus, immune from federal interference.

The best argument that would support Moss's constitutional claim is:

(A) If the state law authorizes Moss's action, he cannot be prosecuted for violation of a federal law.

(B) The Tenth Amendment forbids the federal government from restricting the state's rights regarding the education of minor children within the state.

(C) The doctrine of federalism prevents the federal government from interfering with a member of the state's legislature in the performance of his legislative duties.

(D) As long as the private school is not a parochial school, federal law cannot limit a state's rights regarding the education of minor children within the state.

Questions 44-46 are based on the following fact situation:

Stone operated a newsstand on leased space in an office building. On March 15, Quinn purchased the office building and told Stone that he wanted to negotiate a new lease. During the negotiations, Stone and Quinn orally agreed that Stone would have the exclusive right to sell newspapers and magazines in the office building. Quinn prepared a written lease outlining the Stone-Quinn agreement, but forgot to include the agreement that Stone would have exclusive rights in the office building. Stone was given a copy of the lease to read, but Stone merely glanced over the lease because he assumed it reflected his agreement with Quinn. Stone then signed the lease, which included a merger and integration clause. On March 30, Quinn leased space to Jacobs for the establishment of a drug store to be run by Jacobs. The Quinn-Jacobs lease did not prevent Jacobs from selling newspapers or magazines. As a result of the competition, Stone lost substantial profits in his business.

44. Stone brings suit to reform the contract to reflect his exclusive right to sell newspapers and magazines in the office building. The most likely result of this suit is that:

(A) Stone will prevail.

(B) Stone will prevail only if he can prove a mutual mistake.

(C) Stone will not prevail because of the application of the parol evidence rule.

(D) Stone will not prevail because the mistake on his part was unilateral.

45. Assume for purposes of this question only that Stone's prior lease had given him the exclusive right to sell newspapers and magazines in the office building. Assume further that Stone told Quinn that he wanted the new lease to be the same as the old lease, and that Quinn had handed the new lease to Stone and represented it to be the same as the old lease, knowing that this was not true. Stone signed the lease without reading it because Quinn told him that there was no reason to read the new lease. If Stone sues Quinn, Stone could obtain:

(A) Rescission.

(B) Reformation. (C) Novation.

(D) Repudiation.

46. If Stone sues Quinn for misrepresentation, any statements made by Quinn before the lease was signed:

(A) Would be barred by the parol evidence rule.

(B) Would not be barred by the parol evidence rule.

(C) Would be admitted if the lease was proved to be an incomplete agreement of the parties.

(D) Would not be admitted because they occurred prior to the signing of the lease.

Questions 47-48 are based on the following fact situation:

Walter purchased a new power boat with an inboard engine from City Marine. The boat was manufactured by Watersports, Inc. Later that summer, Walter was using his boat on the lake to tow some of his friends while they waterskied when he found himself near the end of the lake where the large dam that had formed the lake was located. Several hundred feet from the dam were large pylons bearing signs warning boaters to stay at least 50 yards away. Between the pylons and the dam, about 100 feet from the pylons, was a partially submerged chain link fence covering the underwater pipes that drew water to run the hydroelectric generating turbines.

Walter decided to show off by weaving his boat in and out of the warning pylons. As he rounded the last of them, the steering mechanism of his boat jammed, and it and Walter were propelled into the chain link fence. Tom, who was skiing behind the boat, was pulled into one of the pylons. Both Walter and Tom were severely injured. The jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules. 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

47. Walter brings an action for damages against City Marine on a theory of strict liability in tort. Who will prevail?

(A) City Marine, if it properly inspected the boat before selling it to Walter.

(B) City Marine, if Walter is found to have been negligent in weaving in and out of the pylons.

(C) Walter, if he can show that the steering failed due to a defect present when the boat left the manufacturer.

(D) Walter, because the steering mechanism failed while he was operating the boat.

48. If Tom brings a negligence action against Watersports, Inc., and it is found that the steering failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the boat, will he recover for his injuries?
(A) No, because he did not purchase the boat.
(B) No, if Walter is found to have been negligent in weaving in and out of the pylons.
(C) Yes, if the defect in the steering mechanism could have been discov- ered by Watersports, Inc. in the exer- cise of reasonable care.
(D) Yes, unless the defect in the steering mechanism could have been discov- ered by City Marine in the exercise of reasonable care.

On September 15, 50 boxes arrived from Seller. Each box was labeled, "Widgetsone gross." On finding that one of the boxes contains 143 widgets, Buyer considered whether to:

I. Seek cover.

II. Immediately sue for breach.

III. Reject the entire shipment of widgets.

Which of the above can Buyer do?
(A) I. and III. only.
(B) I. and II. only.
(C) III. only.
(D) I., II., and III.

\section{Question 50}

Olman expected the value of property near Middletown to increase substantially. To buy a tract known as Blueacre, Olman secured a $\$ 10,000$ mortgage on Blueacre from Exbank. After completing the purchase, Olman wished to make certain improvements on Blueacre. To finance them, Olman took out a $\$ 2,000$ second mortgage on Blueacre from Wybank. Both mortgages were promptly and properly recorded. Before Olman made a payment on either mortgage, the federal government announced that it would begin storing nuclear waste products in the Middletown area. The value of property, including Blueacre, plummeted. Olman did not pay either Exbank or Wybank. Exbank brought a proper action to foreclose, notifying both Olman and Wybank. Purch bought Blueacre at the foreclosure sale for $\$ 6,000$, the property's fair market value.

Assuming there are no special statutes in the jurisdiction regarding deficiency judgments, Olman owes:
(A) $\$ 5,000$ to Exbank and $\$ 1,000$ to Wybank.
(B) $\$ 4,000$ to Exbank and $\$ 2,000$ to Wybank.
(C) Nothing to Exbank and $\$ 2,000$ to Wybank.
(D) \$4,000 to Exbank and nothing to Wybank. 

\section{Question 51}

Donald was convicted of burglary after a jury trial at which the prosecution established that Donald broke into Shelley's house at night by cutting open a window screen and climbing into a bedroom, then was frightened into leaping out the same window when Shelley, who was lying in bed in that same bedroom, produced a revolver from beneath her pillow. Donald testified in his own defense that he entered the house merely to use the telephone, and thus lacked the requisite intent for the entry to constitute burglary. The trial court, after instructing the jury on the elements of burglary, said, "If you find that by a fair preponderance of the evidence Donald has shown that he intended to use the telephone when he entered Shelley's home, then you must find him not guilty."

If Donald appeals his conviction, will he likely obtain a reversal?

(A) Yes, because the trial court's instruction permitted the jury to use the wrong standard of proof, in that they were told to find by a preponderance rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.

(B) Yes, because the trial court's instruction placed the burden of proof upon Donald.

(C) No, because any error in instructions was harmless, since it is more likely than not that the jury would have convicted him anyway.

(D) No, because the trial court is permitted to comment upon the evidence.

\section{Question 52}

The city of West Rabbit's Foot, which lies astride a major interstate highway, recently passed a referendum declaring itself to be a "nuclear free zone." The referendum included a provision making criminal any importation of specified nuclear materials into the city limits. The law was immediately challenged in federal court by an interstate trucking firm which regularly transported prohibited nuclear materials through West Rabbit's Foot on the highway. The case ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court, which held in a 5-4 decision that the challenged ordinance was constitutional because the city had a rational basis for concluding that the citizens of West Rabbit's Foot would be safer if the prohibited materials were kept outside of town, and because the ordinance did not unduly burden interstate commerce. Many other towns and cities throughout the nation considered similar enactments after the Supreme Court decision was announced. You are a lobbyist hired by the trucking industry to persuade Congress that a federal statute prohibiting the state regulation of interstate transportation of nuclear materials must immediately be enacted. Congress member Bluster has tentatively agreed to sponsor such legislation, but wants to know whether such a federal statute would pass constitutional muster.

You should advise Bluster that the proposed statute would probably be held:

(A) Unconstitutional, since the Supreme Court has already ruled that local governments may prohibit specified nuclear materials from crossing their borders.

(B) Unconstitutional, because the disparate treatment of interstate versus intrastate carriers of nuclear materials would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(C) Constitutional, because Congress has plenary power to regulate interstate commerce.

(D) Constitutional, because the Supremacy Clause requires that state enactments bow to conflicting federal legislation.

\section{Question 53}

Shelley lived in a house on a large corner lot. A few hundred feet down the street was a convenience store used by many people in the neighborhood, and everyone would take a short cut across Shelley's front yard rather than staying on the sidewalk that bordered her lawn. 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

The heavy foot traffic was starting to wear a path through her lawn, and everyone left soft drink cans and candy wrappers strewn all over her front yard. Shelley therefore decided to build a fence around her front lawn, and hired Jack, a local contractor, to do the work. The next afternoon, Jack started the job by surveying the property and digging post holes. After he had completed that task, he left to do another small job in that area, leaving behind a wheelbarrow with a shovel leaning against it. When Shelley noticed that Jack had left the wheelbarrow and shovel in her front yard, she called his office and spoke to his wife. Jack's wife said that he was on another job in the area and must have intended to pick up the wheelbarrow and shovel on his way back. Shelley said that was fine, and left to go to her weekly bridge club meeting. Later that evening, Jack, who had finished the other job, returned to his office without stopping at Shelley's house.

Eric, who owned a house down the street from Shelley, was walking to the convenience store to pick up a six-pack of beer. Because it was summer, it was still quite light, although it was 7 p.m. When he came to Shelley's house he took his usual short cut. A police car with siren wailing went by on the main street just as Eric was walking by the wheelbarrow, and as he followed the police car with his eyes, he tripped over the shovel leaning against the wheelbarrow and fell, breaking his arm.

Is Shelley liable to Eric for his broken arm and related damages?

(A) No, because she did not create the condition that harmed him.

(B) No, because the danger to which he was exposed was open and obvious.

(C) Yes, because she was aware of the condition that harmed him.

(D) Yes, because she knew that he frequently cut across her lawn on the way to the convenience store.

\section{Question 54}

Fred, a licensed real estate broker, and Tom, a homeowner, entered into a written listing agreement in which, among other things, Tom promised to pay Fred a commission of $6 \%$ of the selling price of Tom's home if Fred obtained a buyer ready, willing, and able to purchase it. Tom's home was listed in a service made available to real estate professionals, with an asking price of $\$ 80,000$.

Murray, looking for a home to buy, went to Fred's real estate office and was shown Tom's home. He submitted a written offer to purchase the home for $\$ 80,000$, but Tom rejected this offer by, according to its terms, not accepting it within a stated period. Tom did not want to sell to Murray because, given the amount Murray had intended to borrow, Tom would have had to take back a second mortgage for a portion of his equity, and he did not consider Murray a good credit risk.

Murray brings an action against Tom for specific performance, seeking to compel him to sell the home. What is the probable outcome of this litigation?

(A) Tom will win, because no writing or writings constitute a memorandum sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.

(B) Tom will win, because Murray's remedy at law is adequate.

(C) Murray will win, because he is a thirdparty beneficiary of the agreement between Tom and Fred.

(D) Murray will win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.

\section{Question 55}

Both Kenton and Evan owned their own homes on large tracts of land next to each other in the country. Evan, a physics teacher at the local college, was also a model rocket enthusiast. On many occasions he would launch one of his rockets from the back area of his property, and although none of Evan's rockets ever came near Kenton's property, Kenton was understandably upset. Kenton complained to Evan several times about his hobby and the fact that Evan stored flammable fuels in his house. Once, Kenton complained to the county sheriff, whereupon Evan was charged with violating a local ordinance that prohibits the improper storage of flammable liquids on residential property. He was given a warning and told that he must have proper storage permits and facilities if he intended to keep the fuels for his model rockets on his property. Although Evan obtained the proper permits to build underground storage tanks for his fuels, he continued to store them in 55gallon drums in a shed located on the edge of his property farthest away from Kenton.

Eventually, Kenton brought a suit based on public nuisance against Evan. If Kenton is seeking an injunction against Evan to prevent his storing flammable liquids on his property and his launching model rockets, the defense by which Evan most likely would prevail is that:
(A) He obtained a permit from the city to build storage tanks for the fuels.
(B) There is no showing that Kenton suffered any special damage.
(C) This is not a residential neighborhood.
(D) There is no specific ordinance that prohib- its Evan from launching model rockets on his own property.

\section{Question 56}

Harry and Wilma were going through a divorce proceeding and were contesting the value of their house. Harry, a real estate agent familiar with property values in the area, had personally prepared an appraisal shortly before commencement of the divorce proceedings. The appraisal document stated that the house was worth $\$ 200,000$. Nora, a next-door neighbor of Harry and Wilma's, had seen this appraisal document. During settlement negotiations, Harry maintained that the house was worth $\$ 180,000$. When negotiations proved to be fruitless, the parties proceeded to trial. At trial, Wilma called Nora to testify as to the value placed on the house in the appraisal document. Nora's only knowledge as to the house's value comes from having read the document. Harry's attorney objects.

May Nora testify as to the value stated in the appraisal document?

(A) Yes, because she has personal knowledge of the contents of the document.

(B) Yes, if Harry has destroyed the document.

(C) No, because the appraisal document is the best, and thus the only admissible, evidence.

(D) No, because Nora's testimony would be inadmissible hearsay.

\section{Question 57}

During a gang shootout in City, Joe looked for Egbert among the combatants because he wanted to kill him. He spotted Ira, who resembled Egbert. Believing Ira to be Egbert, Joe shot at Ira and missed. The bullet passed through a window and killed Gladys, who was asleep on her sofa.

Joe may properly be convicted of:

I. Attempted murder of Egbert.

II. Attempted murder of Ira.

III. Murder of Gladys.
(A) I. and II. only.
(B) II. only.
(C) II. and III. only.
(D) None of the above. Questions 58-60 are based on the following fact situation:

Justin is being tried for the murder of Harvey, which occurred during the course of the robbery of Harvey's house.

58. A witness to the robbery and murder had aided the police artist in making the composite picture by which Justin was identified. This witness disappeared before trial, and the prosecutor now wants to offer the sketch into evidence. The sketch is:
(A) Inadmissible, under the best evidence rule.
(B) Inadmissible, as hearsay not within any exception.
(C) Admissible, as a record by a public employee.
(D) Admissible, as a prior identification.

59. Justin took the stand in his own defense. His attorney asked him about the robbery and murder, and Justin denied committing the crimes. His attorney asked him what he said to the police when he was first arrested and he said, "I told them I knew nothing of the crimes because I was in Seattle at the time." This answer should be:
(A) Stricken, because it is self-serving.
(B) Stricken, because it is hearsay.
(C) Admissible, because Justin can com- petently testify to statements he made himself.
(D) Admissible, as a prior consistent statement.

60. On cross-examination of Justin, the prosecution asks Justin whether he was convicted of fraud within the previous year. This question is:
(A) Improper, because fraud is not proba- tive of a tendency to commit violence.
(B) Improper, unless the proper founda- tion was laid.
(C) Proper, because fraud is a form of stealing, and so it will tend to show that Justin could commit robbery.
(D) Proper, because it tends to show that Justin would lie.

\section{Question 61}

In which of the following situations is the named defendant most likely to suffer a criminal conviction that would be upheld on appeal?

(A) Byron, who admits to an undercover operative that he regularly snorted Jack Daniels whiskey until last Christmas, is prosecuted under a law effective January 1 of this year that makes it a felony for anyone to snort any alcoholic beverage.

(B) Chadwick, when asked by an off-duty police officer to sell two Super Bowl tickets for five times their face value, loudly proclaims, "I couldn't do that, stranger, because scalping is a felony in this state!" Chadwick, who is unaware that the buyer is a police officer, then whispers to the buyer, "But if you make it six times face value, you've got a deal, buddy." Also unknown to Chadwick, effective the previous week, it is no longer a criminal offense in that state to scalp tickets to sports events. Chadwick is prosecuted for attempted scalping.

(C) State law makes it a misdemeanor to place water in a container that has held chlorine bleach. Duncan, whose car has overheated in the desert, walks several miles to a deserted gas station that has running water and fills an old chlorine bleach container with water to carry back to his car. On the way back, he is picked up by the highway patrol who notice the bleach container and ask what is inside. When Duncan answers, "Water," he is arrested for violation of the misdemeanor statute.

(D) Ed, sitting at a bar whose bartender is an undercover police officer, says to the officer, "God, I'd like to kill my wife. If there was any way I thought I could do it and not get caught, I'd blow her away in a second." Ed is prosecuted for violating a statute that proscribes intent to murder.

\section{Question 62}

Congress enacted a statute, over the President's veto, that granted Congress the power to compel the President to remove United States troops from foreign territory when such troops have for 60 days been engaged in hostilities and there has been no formal declaration of war. The statute also provided that Congress may force the President to withdraw the troops before the 60 days have elapsed if Congress passes a joint resolution to that effect.

Which of the following statements best describes the likely result of judicial review of the constitutional validity of this statute?

(A) The statute is a valid exercise of Congress's authority under the war power.

(B) The statute is constitutionally suspect as an infringement on the President's exclusive power, as commander in chief, over matters relating to war.

(C) The statute is a valid exercise of Congress's foreign relations powers.

(D) The statute is constitutionally suspect, because the joint resolution is not subject to a presidential veto.

\section{Question 63}

Due to intense foreign competition in the domestic market and other adverse economic conditions, the domestic manufacturers of horse liniment formed a trade association, the American Horse Liniment Institute ("AHLI"), whose main purpose was to lobby Congress for tariff protection and for grants-in-aid to modernize their plants, which everyone agreed were less efficient than those of their Asian and European competitors.

Congress passed legislation providing some degree of protection from foreign competition and appropriating \$200 million for grants-in-aid to domestic horse liniment manufacturers. However, because of concern about inefficiencies in the industry, the legislation was amended to allow the Secretary of Commerce to deny grants to horse liniment manufacturers who failed to meet certain "management efficiency standards" outlined in the legislation.

Lum \& Bagel Co., a liniment manufacturer and a member of AHLI, petitioned the Secretary of Commerce for a \$15 million grant, the amount to which Lum \& Bagel would be entitled under the legislation, based upon the number of its employees and plants and upon its average production of horse liniment over a 10-year period. The Secretary of Commerce refused to award funds to Lum \& Bagel, because she determined that Lum \& Bagel was making no attempt to improve its management efficiency. Lum \& Bagel filed suit against the Secretary of Commerce, asserting that the power granted to the Secretary was unconstitutional.

Is the legislation constitutional?

(A) Yes, because the Secretary of Commerce, as a representative of the executive branch, may be granted regulatory authority.

(B) Yes, because the executive branch, represented by the Secretary of Commerce, shares power with Congress in the field of foreign commerce.

(C) No, because there was an improper delegation of legislative power.

(D) No, because the executive branch may not impound funds appropriated by Congress.

\section{Question 64}

Strobe, the owner of Goldacre, decided to sell her property and move to another state. She told her friends to "spread the word" that she wished to sell. After one week, Strobe received in the mail a written offer, signed by Briggs, to purchase Goldacre for $\$ 50,000$. The written offer was legally sufficient to form a written contract for the sale of Goldacre. Strobe called Briggs and said that the offer was acceptable, but that she did not want to sign it at that time because she wanted to "make sure the paper was legal." The next day Strobe visited her attorney, gave him the written offer from Briggs, and asked him to prepare a formal contract for the sale of Goldacre on the same terms and conditions as those in the written offer. When the attorney had finished, Strobe signed the contract prepared by her attorney and mailed it to Briggs. Later that day, before Briggs had received the contract, Norris called Strobe and offered to buy Goldacre for $\$ 60,000$, which Strobe accepted immediately over the phone. Strobe called Briggs and told him that she had received a higher offer from Norris that she had accepted. Strobe then signed a written contract to sell Goldacre to Norris. When Norris received the contract he signed it and then promptly and properly recorded it, and sent Strobe the specified down payment. Briggs received the written contract from Strobe the next day. The recording statute in the jurisdiction provides:

Any conveyance of an interest in land, other than a lease for less than one year, shall not be valid against a subsequent purchaser for value, without notice thereof, whose conveyance is first recorded.

In an appropriate action brought by Briggs against Strobe and Norris for specific performance and to quiet title, Briggs will:

(A) Win, because the written offer satisfies the Statute of Frauds.

(B) Win, because the contract of sale satisfied the Statute of Frauds. (C) Lose, because he never entered into a binding contract with Strobe.

(D) Lose, because the recording statute protects Norris.

Questions 65-66 are based on the following fact situation:

In 1998, Jane sold Wes her resort hotel for $\$ 250,000$. Wes paid $\$ 100,000$ down and agreed to pay the balance in equal monthly installments over the next 15 years.

Jane's eldest son, Luke, started law school in 1999 and, because Jane wanted to help him with his educational and living expenses, she sent a letter to Wes instructing him to send Luke $\$ 500$ a month from the money he owed to Jane until Jane instructed him otherwise.

Wes was unable to raise the capital he needed to expand the hotel, and in 2000 he sold the resort to Funco in exchange for Funco's agreement to assume all his obligations and to provide him with a long-term contract to be the hotel's manager. Funco agreed with these terms and assumed the contract Wes had with Jane.

In 2002, when Luke had completed law school, Jane's other son, Zack, was getting married. Jane knew Zack could not afford to buy a house so Jane told Zack that she would instruct Wes and Funco to send the full installments to Zack so he could buy a house if Zack agreed that Jane could have the funds back if she ever needed them. Zack agreed, and Jane wrote a letter to Wes informing him of this agreement and instructing him that the full payment should now go to Zack. Zack was given a copy of this letter.

In 2003, Funco wanted to get out of the resort business, and it sold the hotel and all the obligations back to Wes. About this same time, Jane promised her sister's daughter, Susan, that if she wanted to go to Europe for several months to study art, Jane would pay her expenses. Susan agreed, and Jane sent another letter to Wes telling him to send the monthly installments to Susan until Jane told him otherwise. Wes did so. Several months later Jane died, leaving all her cash (and the balance due on the note from Wes) to Zack.

65. Luke sued Wes, claiming he was entitled to receive $\$ 500$ per month from 2002 until all sums due to Jane had been paid. How would a court hold?

(A) Judgment for Wes, because Luke was only a gratuitous assignee and had no protected rights against Wes.

(B) Judgment for Luke, because he had changed his position in reliance upon Jane's agreement.

(C) Judgment for Wes, because Jane had the right to stop making payments to Luke at anytime.

(D) Judgment for Luke, because his rights were vested when Wes was instructed to make the payments to him.

66. If Zack were to sue Funco to recover the sums paid to Susan, how would a court hold?

(A) Judgment for Zack, because he was a creditor beneficiary, had notice, and had changed his position in reliance on the contract.

(B) Judgment for Zack, because he was a donee beneficiary and had assented to the agreement.

(C) Judgment for Funco, because Zack's rights had not vested before being extinguished by the subsequent assignment.

(D) Judgment for Funco, because Zack was only an incidental beneficiary of its agreement with Wes.

Questions 67-68 are based on the following fact situation:

Leftacre and Rightacre are adjoining 50-acre parcels of land. For many years, Leftacre and Rightacre have been thriving dairy farms. In 1959, McWilliams, the owner of Rightacre, purchased Leftacre. She continued to operate both parcels as separate dairy farms. In 1979, McWilliams sold Rightacre to Stone, who promptly and properly recorded the deed. Since Rightacre had no direct access to a public road, McWilliams wrote into the deed, "Stone, his heirs and assigns shall have the right to use the existing dirt path along the eastern border of Leftacre for ingress and egress to Rightacre." The dirt path, which connected with a public road on the northern boundary of Leftacre, was wide enough for motored vehicle traffic and had been graded for that purpose. In 1994, Sandberg purchased Leftacre from McWilliams. In 2002, Stone died, leaving a will that devised all his interest in Rightacre to O'Toole.

67. For this question only, assume the following facts: In 2003, Sandberg decided to subdivide Leftacre into lots for singlefamily residences. Since no street in the proposed subdivision will align with the dirt path mentioned in the 1979 deed from McWilliams to Stone, O'Toole will be without ingress and/or egress to Rightacre. $O$ 'Toole instituted an appropriate action to enjoin the blocking of the dirt path. The most likely result is that judgment will be for:

(A) O'Toole, because the owner of the servient tenement cannot obstruct an express easement.

(B) O'Toole, because O'Toole has a way by necessity.

(C) Sandberg, because there has been a significant change in conditions and circumstances.

(D) Sandberg, because the appropriate remedy for $\mathrm{O}^{\prime}$ Toole is damages, not injunction.

68. For this question only, assume the following facts: In 2003, O'Toole decided to subdivide Rightacre into several lots for 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

single-family residences. O' Toole notified Sandberg that he, O'Toole, will spend the money to improve the dirt path into a private driveway by paving it and doubling its width to 24 feet. He will also provide appropriate drainage for such an improved driveway by means of ditches on either side of the pavement. Sandberg had ceased using Leftacre as a dairy farm five years earlier, and it has been vacant ever since. Sandberg instituted an appropriate action for a declaratory judgment to establish that O'Toole cannot so improve the dirt path. If Sandberg prevails in such an action, it will be because:
(A) The proposed improvement exceeds the scope of an easement by necessity.
(B) The proposed improvement consti- tutes a burden that exceeds the scope of an express easement.
(C) The servient owner has the obligation for maintenance of an easement for right-of-way, and hence can control the nature of its improvement.
(D) The proposed subdivision so changes the nature of the use of the dominant tenement that any easement has been abandoned.

\section{Question 69}

I. Jane Pease files suit on behalf of herself and taxpayers nationwide to challenge the federal government's spending so much money on military weaponry instead of using the funds for social programs.

II. The "Save Our Wildlife" group files suit to block further oil drilling in the nation because such drilling is contrary to the public's interest in preserving wildlife.

III. The "End Nuclear Power Now Society" files suit challenging a state law that requires disclosure of the Society's membership, alleging that the law infringes on its members' freedom of association.

IV. Luigi Vercotti files suit to challenge exclusionary zoning practices by Carson City, alleging that the challenged zoning made it too expensive for him to buy a home in Carson City.
(A) I. only.
(B) II. and III. only.
(C) III. only.
(D) III. and IV. only.

\section{Question 70}

Concerned with the rising amount of organized crime activity in this country, Congress enacts the Stop Organized Crime Act ("SOCA"), which enumerates certain activities, and states that in addition to any crimes these activities currently constitute, they will henceforth constitute the criminal act of intentional furtherance of the goals of organized crime. Among the enumerated activities is the interstate distribution of cocaine. For purposes of this question, you are to assume that the Act is constitutional and otherwise valid in all respects.

Dalton is arrested by federal agents after having driven a truck containing cocaine from Florida to Illinois, where he delivered his illicit cargo to Thomas. At trial, Dalton is convicted of interstate distribution of cocaine, as well as of a violation of SOCA.

Dalton may be sentenced:
(A) Under either statute, but not both.
(B) Under both statutes.
(C) Only under the statute that carries a lesser maximum sentence.
(D) Only under the statute that carries a greater maximum sentence. 

\section{Question 71}

Egbert has died without having executed a will, and his rather substantial estate must be distributed by the probate court. The jurisdiction's applicable statute provides that where a decedent leaves neither issue nor spouse, nor parents, his estate goes to his brothers and sisters and their descendants. Egbert was never married, had no children, and both of his parents are dead. Tamara, whose birth certificate was destroyed by fire, seeks to establish that she is the daughter of Egbert's only sibling, Ethel, now also deceased.

Tamara offers into evidence the statement in a trust instrument recorded pursuant to statute in the office of the county recorder (in which the original is kept). The instrument was executed by Egbert's father, Ethelbert, and recited that certain specified real property conveyed by Ethelbert into the trust should be held for the benefit of "my devoted son Egbert and my beloved daughter Ethel and her loving daughter Tamara." The document actually offered is an enlarged print photocopy of microfilm records, authenticated by an employee of the county.

The trial court should:

(A) Exclude the evidence, because it is not the best evidence.

(B) Exclude the evidence, because it is inadmissible hearsay not within any recognized exception.

(C) Admit the evidence, because it is a record of a document affecting an interest in property.

(D) Admit the evidence, because it constitutes a past recollection recorded.

Questions 72-73 are based on the following fact situation:

Parker was a guest at Hotel, located about 200 miles from his home. After Parker had spent two nights at Hotel, he received a call at 5 a.m. from his wife, who told him that their child had just been rushed to the hospital and was in critical condition. Parker decided to hurry home. He called the airport and reserved space on the next flight out, scheduled to leave at $6: 15$ a.m. Parker packed and rushed to the lobby. However, it happened that a number of guests were checking out early that morning, and thus there was a long line ahead of him and only one cashier on duty. Parker hoped that the line would move quickly, but when he heard the first guest in line arguing with Stockton, the desk clerk, over a $25 \notin$ telephone charge, he realized that he would never make it to the airport in time if he continued to wait in line. The hotel had no express check-out service available, so he left without paying his bill and flew home.

As soon as Parker's child was out of danger, he wrote a letter to Hotel, apologizing for his swift departure and enclosing payment for two nights' lodging; he also added an extra $\$ 25$ "to cover any inconvenience and billing expense" he may have caused. Meanwhile, Stockton discovered that Parker had left without paying. On Hotel's behalf, Stockton signed a complaint with the state police, charging Parker with theft of services. The police went to the appropriate magistrate, and a warrant was sworn out for Parker's arrest. The day after Parker left Hotel, Hotel received Parker's letter and payment. However, no one notified the police that Parker had paid his bill. Three days after Parker left Hotel, the state police, armed with a warrant, came to Parker's office and arrested him. Despite Parker's objections, he was taken to jail. Although he repeatedly told the police that he had paid his bill and suggested that they call Hotel, they refused to do so. After holding Parker for 18 hours, the police called Hotel. The manager told the police, "Yes, we got Parker's check two days ago, but we were too busy to call you." The police, with apologies, released Parker. Parker sued Hotel and the state police for false imprisonment.

72. In Parker's action against Hotel, who will prevail?

(A) Hotel, because Hotel reasonably believed that Parker stole services. 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

(B) Hotel, because the police were not employees of Hotel.

(C) Parker, because Hotel failed to promptly notify the police that Hotel had received Parker's check.

(D) Parker, because Hotel failed to have an adequate number of cashiers on duty when Parker wanted to check out.

73. Will Parker prevail in his action against the police?
(A) Yes, because of Parker's protestations of innocence.
(B) Yes, because Parker had not stolen services.
(C) No, because the police acted pursuant to a valid warrant.
(D) No, because Hotel had reasonable grounds for signing a complaint against Parker.

\section{Question 74}

The Federal Endangered Species Act imposes criminal penalties for killing certain specified animals that have been determined by Congress to be of importance to the tourism industry in the region in which the animal is located. Among the animals protected are the Puce Bandicoots of the Great Spotted Valley area of the state of Wilderness. The state of Wilderness classifies Puce Bandicoots as varmints that may be destroyed at will by anyone with a general hunting license.

Rancher, who possesses a valid state of Wilderness general hunting license, regularly shoots and kills Puce Bandicoots that prey upon his artichoke plants.

If Rancher is prosecuted under the federal statute, and challenges the constitutionality of the law, which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument in support of the federal statute?
(A) The commerce power.
(B) The Necessary and Proper Clause.
(C) The police power.
(D) The power to regulate federal lands.

\section{Question 75}

Manfred recently moved from an apartment to a house with a large yard. Fortunately, Manfred worked as a checkout clerk at Gardenshop, a nursery and garden supply concern, and was eligible for a discount on a lawn mower. Lately, he had been eyeing a fancy new model of power mower, but even with his discount, it was out of reach. When Manfred's neighbors began complaining about his yard, Manfred decided that he would simply take his dream mower. Gardenshop had so many, they would never miss it, he reasoned. The next day, he took a mower from the Garden Equipment Department and hid it behind some crates on the loading dock. He planned to take the mower home with him that night because he was scheduled to close the business for that day. At the end of the day, however, Manfred became afraid that he would be caught. He returned the mower to the Garden Equipment Department and went home as usual.

Manfred has most likely committed:
(A) Larceny.
(B) Attempted larceny.
(C) Embezzlement.
(D) No crime.

Questions 76-77 are based on the following fact situation:

Zelda, a paving contractor with an excellent reputation in the community, entered into a written contract with Norman to pave the parking lot behind his new store. The contract contained no provision regarding assignment.

A few days after they entered into the contract, Zelda realized that scheduling difficulties would make it impossible for her to complete the job in the time Norman needed to have the job done. Instead of running the risk of being in breach of contract, she assigned the job to one of her competitors, Kurt, whom she regarded as being almost as good as she, and who agreed to do the job for the contract price.

76. With regard to this assignment by Zelda, which of the following statements is true?
(A) The assignment is valid only if Norman agrees to accept performance by Kurt.
(B) Zelda breached her contract with Norman by assigning it to Kurt with- out his prior consent.
(C) Norman must accept performance by Kurt.
(D) The assignment is valid, even if Norman objects, as long as Zelda supervises the performance of the contract by Kurt.

77. Assume for the purposes of this question only that Kurt paved the parking lot under the contract, but Norman did not realize that Kurt was substituting for Zelda until the job was half complete. Upon learning that, Norman let Kurt complete the job. If Kurt fails to perform the job in accordance with the original terms of the agreement between Zelda and Norman, Norman:
(A) Has a cause of action only against Kurt for damages.
(B) Has a cause of action against Kurt and Zelda for damages.
(C) Has no cause of action against Kurt, because he and Kurt are not in privity of contract.
(D) Has no cause of action against Zelda, because he accepted performance from Kurt.

\section{Question 78}

Developer owned a large tract of land that she had surveyed by a licensed surveyor and then subdivided into numerous lots. At the time of the survey, the surveyor drove wooden stakes into the ground to mark the boundaries. The surveyor then made a plat of the survey and recorded the plat in the County Recorder of Deeds Office.

On June 1, Andrew purchased Lot 20 in the tract from Developer. Prior to purchase, Developer had shown Andrew the wooden stakes, and Andrew accepted such stakes as marking the boundaries of Lot 20 . After taking possession of Lot 20 , Andrew built a house thereon and enclosed it with a fence.

On September 5, Bruce purchased Lot 21 from Developer. Lot 21 was adjacent to Lot 20. After taking possession of Lot 21, Bruce hired a licensed surveyor to survey Lot 21 . This surveyor discovered that, according to the recorded plat, Andrew's fence extended two feet onto Lot 21. Upon learning this, Bruce demanded that Andrew remove his fence. Andrew refused.

If Bruce sues Andrew, who will prevail?
(A) Andrew, because he bought his lot first.
(B) Andrew, because the surveyor's stakes are controlling.
(C) Bruce, because the recorded plat controls.
(D) Bruce, because the adverse possession period has not run.

\section{Question 79}

During Dan's prosecution for burglary, the prosecution calls Teddy to the stand, and the following takes place: Prosecutor: "After Dan left the room, what did Roger say to you, if anything?" Previous evidence has established that Roger and Dan had agreed, prior to the time Dan left the room, to burglarize a jewelry store. Defense counsel: "Objection!" Court: "Overruled."' Teddy then testifies about what Roger said.

If defense counsel wishes to complain about the court's ruling in this matter on appeal, what more should she do before the trial concludes? 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

(A) Nothing.

(B) Ask the court for the reasons that the objection was overruled.

(C) Restate the objection for the record, stating the grounds therefor.

(D) Request the trial court to order the prosecution to make an offer of proof.

\section{Question 80}

Davis is arrested and tried for battery. At trial, the prosecution offers evidence that shows Davis punched Verne in the stomach. In which of the following situations is Davis most likely to be not guilty of battery?

(A) Davis was heavily intoxicated and was attempting to swat at a fly when he punched Verne.

(B) Davis, who had just awakened from a deep sleep, was not fully aware of what was happening and mistakenly thought Verne was attacking him.

(C) Davis was suffering from an epileptic seizure and had no control over his motions.

(D) Davis, angered by something Verne had said, punched him in retaliation.

\section{Question 81}

Dag lost about $\$ 500$ while playing poker with several persons at Vance's house. When Dag accused Vance of cheating, Vance asked him to leave. Dag became abusive and refused to leave, so Vance and a couple of other players forced him to go.

Angry and determined to get back his money, Dag went to his home and got his gun. He put his pistol into his coat pocket and headed back to Vance's house intending to shoot Vance if he did not give back the $\$ 500$. But, because Vance knew that Dag had a reputation for being violent, after the altercation at the house Vance had called the police. Just as Dag was about to step onto Vance's property, the police pulled up and stopped him. They frisked him, and finding the pistol in his pocket, arrested him.

A state statute prohibits entry onto the property of another with the intent to commit violence thereon.

If charged with attempt under this statute, most likely Dag will be found:

(A) Not guilty, because this is an "attempt" statute, and there cannot be an attempt of an attempt.

(B) Not guilty, because it would be an attempt to convict a person for a guilty mind.

(C) Guilty, because Dag was trying to enter the property and he had the necessary state of mind.

(D) Guilty, because the statute was designed to protect the public from violence, and Dag is dangerous.

\section{Question 82}

The state of Eastern Seaboard enacted a sales tax on specified items purchased within the state. The General Services Administration ("GSA") of the United States Government purchased from a dealer in Scrodtown, the largest city in Eastern Seaboard, 100 new automobiles for use by federal agencies operating within the state.

Must GSA pay the sales tax applicable to the new auto purchase?

(A) No, unless Congress has consented to such a tax.

(B) No, because the tax unfairly discriminates against interstate commerce.

(C) Yes, because the tax is nondiscriminatory.

(D) Yes, because there is a rational basis for the tax and it does not appear to be a disguised penalty. 

\section{Question 83}

Lonny owned Gold Acre, a 40-acre tract of land improved with a one-story house. Lonny leased Gold Acre to Truman for a 15-year period. After five years had expired, the government condemned 15 acres of the property for road construction and allocated the compensation award to Lonny and Truman according to the respective interest so taken. It so happened, however, that Truman had used the 15 acres taken by the government to store vehicles necessary in Truman's work. Truman knew of no other place nearby where he could store the vehicles. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction where the property is located, nor any provision in the lease relating to the condemnation. Truman quit possession, claiming that he could no longer live in the premises if he could not park the vehicles needed in his work close to where he lived. Lonny brought suit against Truman to recover rent.

The most likely result of this suit is that Lonny will:

(A) Prevail, because the relationship of landlord and tenant was unaffected by the condemnation, thus leaving Truman still obligated to pay rent.

(B) Prevail, because of the implied warranty on the part of the tenant to return the demised premises in the same condition at the end of the term as they were at the beginning.

(C) Not prevail, because there has been a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by Lonny's inability to provide Truman with possession of the whole of the property for the entire term.

(D) Not prevail, because there has been a frustration of purpose that excuses Truman from further performance of his contract to pay rent.

\section{Question 84}

Tyrone challenged Dennison to an automobile race from Smalltown to Littleburg, a distance of 11 miles. The only road that ran between the two cities was Highway 17, a two-lane country road. At the 7-mile mark, Tyrone attempted to pass Dennison by pulling into the lane to the left of the center line. At that moment, Pryor's car came into view, heading directly at Tyrone's vehicle. Tyrone applied his brakes and attempted to pull back into the lane to the right of the center line. In so doing, Tyrone lost control of his vehicle and collided with Pryor's car. Dennison's car, having already passed Pryor's car, was not involved in the collision. Pryor brings suit against Dennison for damages suffered in the collision.

Which of the following would be Dennison's best course of action?

(A) Seek dismissal of the claim, because Dennison did not cause Pryor's damage.

(B) Seek indemnity from Tyrone, if Pryor recovers a judgment against Dennison.

(C) Ask the court to limit his liability to onehalf of Pryor's damages.

(D) Seek contribution from Tyrone, if Pryor recovers a judgment against Dennison.

\section{Question 85}

State A, suffering from a severe loss of tax revenues due to an initiative that cut state sales taxes in half, enacted legislation that ended costof-living increases in all state employees' pensions.

If a state organization of employees brought suit against the appropriate state official in the federal court to reinstate the increase, the most likely result will be that:

(A) The employees' organization will prevail, because the statute violates the prohibition against the impairment of the obligations of contracts by a state.

(B) The employees' organization will prevail, if it can show that the statute violates the state's constitution. (C) The employees' suit will be dismissed, because the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a state's citizens from suing a state official for official acts in a federal court.

(D) The employees' organization will not prevail, because the state always has the power to amend its own legislation.

\section{Question 86}

Jeff lived in Arkanzona, a state where gambling was illegal. Nevertheless, Jeff gambled on a regular basis. Unfortunately, Jeff had a string of bad luck and needed a loan. Jeff asked his friend Steve to lend him $\$ 5,000$ to bet on a football game. Jeff claimed that the heavily favored Sabrebacks would lose the game because the game was fixed, and thus he could make a fortune by betting $\$ 5,000$ against them. Steve, not wanting to miss out on a good deal, agreed to lend Jeff $\$ 2,500$ if Jeff would bet the other $\$ 2,500$ for Steve. Jeff agreed, took Steve's $\$ 5,000$, and placed the bet. Jeff's tip paid off and Jeff won on 4-to-1 odds. He gave Steve his $\$ 5,000$ back but refused to tender any winnings.

If Steve sues Jeff to recover the winnings due under the contract, who will prevail?

(A) Steve, because he fully performed his part of the bargain.

(B) Steve, because the court will not allow Jeff to unfairly profit from his illegal contract.

(C) Jeff, because the contract was illegal and the court will not enforce an illegal contract.

(D) Jeff, because the contract was illegal and the court will only act to put the parties in the status quo ante, and Steve already has his money back.

\section{Question 87}

Doris was at a restaurant eating lunch when she looked up and saw another woman take Doris's coat off the coat rack and walk out the door with it. Doris quickly left and followed the woman. She saw the woman enter a house where she apparently lived. Later, when Doris knew that the woman was not at home, Doris opened a window in the woman's house, climbed in, and got her coat out of the front closet. When she put the coat on, however, she noticed for the first time that in fact it was not her coat. But, because it was so cold outside, Doris decided to wear this coat home and to return it the next day. The following day Doris changed her mind and decided to keep the coat.

Doris is guilty of:
(A) Larceny.
(B) Burglary.
(C) Both larceny and burglary.
(D) Neither larceny nor burglary.

\section{Question 88}

Paula's friend Roberto told her that she could use his lakeside cabin for the weekend. Roberto gave Paula instructions on how to find his cabin, but once Paula arrived at the lake, she found that all the cabins looked very similar. Paula rechecked Roberto's instructions and then entered the cabin that she thought belonged to Roberto. In fact, the cabin belonged to Otto.

After Paula unpacked her luggage, she realized that the cabin was quite cold. Thus, she gathered some wood from the woodpile and started a fire in the fireplace. Unbeknownst to Paula, the fireplace flue was blocked and so an explosion ensued; Paula was injured by the explosion. Otto had known that the flue was blocked, but he had not gotten around to having the problem fixed.

If Paula sues Otto for her injuries, who will prevail?

(A) Paula, because Otto knew that the flue was defective.

(B) Paula, because Otto had a duty to warn of the defect. (C) Otto, but only if he had no reason to anticipate that anyone would be in the cabin.

(D) Otto, because he owed no duty to Paula.

\section{Question 89}

On Halloween night, Darryl, who is 12 years old, dressed up as a bandit by wearing dark clothes and a pair of panty hose over his head and went trick or treating. Darryl carried a toy gun that looked like a real firearm. Darryl's method of operation was to go up to a house and ring the bell. When the person answered, he pointed his toy gun at the person's face and said, "Your money or your life," and then shouted, "Trick or treat!" At the fifth house he went to, Darryl began his routine, but before he could say "trick or treat," Patty, the elderly homeowner, screamed and slammed the door in Darryl's face. Still shaken by the experience, Patty suffered a heart attack five minutes later.

Has Patty a cause of action against Darryl?

(A) Yes, for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

(B) Yes, for assault.

(C) No, because Darryl is only 12 years old.

(D) No, because Patty should have known that the gun was a toy since it was Halloween.

\section{Question 90}

The jurisdiction in which Dawn lives follows the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. If Dawn conveys her property to "Clara, her heirs and assigns, as long as the premises are used for noncommercial purposes, then to Grant, his heirs and assigns," Dawn's interest in the property, if any, is:
(A) Nothing.
(B) A reversion in fee simple absolute.
(C) A possibility of reverter.

(D) A right of entry based on a condition subsequent.

Questions 91-92 are based on the following fact situation:

The Drug Control Act is a federal law that seeks to control those substances that are dangerous to the health of the population in general. The statute provides substantial penalties for violations of the Act. The Food and Drug Administration has conducted a substantial number of tests on a new drug called Gelutan. The results of the studies show that the drug might have dangerous side effects when taken regularly, and the Food and Drug Administration now seeks to prohibit its distribution under the Drug Control Act.

91. Drugco, a major pharmaceutical company that desires to market Gelutan, sues to have the statute declared unconstitutional. The most likely result in this suit is that the statute will be declared to be:

(A) Constitutional, as a proper exercise of the general welfare power.

(B) Constitutional, as a proper exercise of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.

(C) Unconstitutional, because it interferes with the right of privacy of Gelutan users.

(D) Unconstitutional, because it deprives Drugco of property without just compensation.

92. Assume for the purposes of this question only that, after further tests, Gelutan is cleared for use in a limited manner as an over-the-counter drug, but only if the drug is produced in pill form. Assume further that Congress, as an extension of the Drug Control Act, enacts an additional provision that levies a one cent per pill tax on Gelutan. This provision is:

(A) Constitutional, under the Supremacy Clause. 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

(B) Constitutional, because it is a proper exercise of congressional power to raise revenue.

(C) Unconstitutional, because the pills are not being sold in interstate commerce.

(D) Unconstitutional, because it interferes with state sovereignty.

\section{Question 93}

In which of the following cases would a leading question least likely be permitted over objection?

(A) When asked on direct examination of a disinterested witness.

(B) When asked on direct examination of a minor.

(C) When asked on cross-examination of an expert witness.

(D) When related to the name, address, or occupation of the witness.

\section{Question 94}

On November 7, Margo agreed with Oscar to paint his house for $\$ 10,000$, payment to be made upon completion of the job. On November 14, while the job was still incomplete, Margo told her paint supplier, Percy, that if he would give her the paint she needed, she would have Oscar pay to him directly the $\$ 3,000$ for paint that she owed him. Percy agreed, and Margo sent Oscar a letter setting forth this agreement.

On December 1, Margo had completed the job, but Oscar refused to pay Percy any money. In a suit by Percy against Oscar, what would be Oscar's best defense?

(A) Percy had already supplied the paint before the agreement, and therefore he had not relied on Oscar's promise.

(B) Percy was not an intended beneficiary of the agreement between Oscar and Margo. (C) Margo had not painted the house in a proper, workmanlike manner.

(D) Margo attempted to assign her rights before completion and an assignment to receive money before personal services are performed is inoperable.

\section{Question 95}

Dennis got into a fight with his former roommate Tom over some money that Dennis claimed Tom owed for some long distance telephone calls. When Tom refused to pay the money, Dennis took two tickets that Tom had purchased for the All Star game, intending to give them back to Tom the day after the game. Dennis is charged with larceny.

Most likely Dennis will be found:

(A) Not guilty, because he intended to return the tickets to Tom.

(B) Not guilty, because he believed that Tom owed him money.

(C) Guilty, because he intended to deprive Tom of the value of the tickets.

(D) Guilty, because the intent to return is not a good defense.

\section{Question 96}

Seth was one of a group of persons who were engaged in a demonstration against the discriminatory practices of a private club. During the demonstration, Seth threw a bomb containing highly toxic gas through the window of the club. At the time he threw the bomb, he knew that the club's president, Larsen, was inside the building. Unknown to Seth, Carver, the club's treasurer, was also inside.

Seth is charged with attempted murder of both Larsen and Carver. At trial, Seth testified that the reason he threw the bomb was that he wanted to make sure that nobody would be able to use the club, and that he did not intend to hurt anyone. Presuming that the jury believes Seth, he can be convicted of the attempted murder of:
(A) Larsen.
(B) Carver.
(C) Both Larsen and Carver.
(D) Neither Larsen nor Carver.

Questions 97-98 are based on the following fact situation:

Maude's will left her farm in Rural County to her two grown children, Lisa and Louis. The will stated that the farm passed to the children "jointly, as tenants in common." Lisa and Louis, having had no interest in farming, had long since moved to Paree, a large city located about 150 miles from the farm. However, after Maude's death, Louis had second thoughts about living on the farm. His children were becoming disciplinary problems in school, and remembering some of his strict but kindly teachers in the Rural County schools, he decided to move back to the farm. Thus, Louis and his family moved into Maude's home. Louis rented various parts of the land to sharecroppers. Louis regularly sent half of any profits from the farm to his sister.

97. Assume that Lisa dies, survived only by her daughter Estelle. By will Lisa left all of her property to Estelle. Louis, however, refuses to pay any of the profits of the farm to Estelle and claims an exclusive interest in the farm. If Estelle sues Louis, how will a court most likely rule?

(A) For Louis, because he actively managed the use of the farm and Lisa never showed any interest in it.

(B) For Louis, because he survived Lisa, the other joint tenant.

(C) For Louis, because the unities of time, title, and interest have been destroyed by Lisa's death.

(D) For Estelle, because she inherited her mother's interest. 98. If Estelle sues not only for the profits from the farm but also seeks an accounting for the years that Louis had exclusive possession of the farm, how will a court most likely rule on this issue?
(A) An accounting will be granted since Louis occupied or controlled more than half of the land.
(B) An accounting will be granted since Louis ousted Lisa from possession.
(C) No accounting will be granted since Lisa had the right to use the property but chose not to do so.
(D) No accounting will be granted if Louis has held the property for the statutory period required for adverse posses- sion.

\section{Question 99}

In July of last summer George, a grape grower, contracted with Walter's Winery to deliver " 500 tons of premium quality pinot chardonnay grapes grown on my ranch Grapeacre in Grape County." The price was to be $\$ 1,000$ per ton and delivery was to be on or before September 15. In August of the same year, George entered into an identical contract with Vinnie's Vintner Co. to sell 300 tons of premium quality pinot chardonnay grapes.

George completed his harvest by September 10 and had 800 tons of premium quality grapes. On September 11, an unexpected rain ruined 400 tons, and George notified Walter and Vinnie on that day that he would only be able to deliver 250 tons to Walter and 150 tons to Vinnie. On September 14, Vinnie purchased an additional 150 tons of premium quality pinot chardonnay grapes from Godfrey, one of several other available sources for premium quality pinot chardonnay grapes. These grapes along with the 150 tons from George gave Vinnie the 300 tons he needed.

On September 15, what is Walter's Winery's legal position with regard to George's failure to 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

deliver the 500 tons of grapes required by his contract?

(A) If Walter has given George a written notice of termination, Walter will have the right to refuse to accept the 250 tons of grapes but will have no cause of action for damages against George.

(B) Even if Walter has given George a written notice of termination, Walter must accept the 250 tons of grapes and will have no cause of action for damages against George.

(C) Since Vinnie's purchase establishes that it is possible for George to perform by obtaining additional grapes from other available sources, Walter may accept the 250 tons from George and recover damages for George's failure to deliver the balance of the amount specified by the contract.

(D) Since George's contract with Walter was entered into before his contract with Vinnie, George is bound to deliver the entirety of his grape crop to Walter.

\section{Question 100}

A statute in State B stated that directors of orphanages, homes for the developmentally disabled, and similar institutions stand in loco parentis to the children under their charge. Dieter, a mentally disabled 11-year-old child, had been abandoned by his parents and lived in the Miserere Home, a State B residential facility for the developmentally disabled operated by the Sisters of Hope, a religious order. Sister Mary Smith was the director of the facility. The Miserere Home had no fence around it, because children who lived there were not considered to be dangerous. Dieter wandered away from the premises and was gone for 36 hours before he was found by the police and returned to Miserere. When Dieter was away from the facility, he beat up Paul, a five-year-old boy. Paul's parents filed suit against Sister Mary on Paul's behalf.

Assuming that no other liability statute applies, who will prevail? (A) Paul, because under the statute Sister Mary has the responsibilities and duties of a parent.

(B) Paul, because Sister Mary is strictly liable for Dieter's acts.

(C) Sister Mary, because parents are not vicariously liable for the intentional torts of their children.

(D) Sister Mary, unless she knew that Dieter had dangerous propensities.

\section{Question 101}

The state of North Pacific contains major deposits of natural gas. In an effort to support this industry, and at the same time save its citizens substantial sums for the cost of heating their homes and businesses, the legislature enacted a substantial tax on out-of-state suppliers of natural gas. In addition, the state required state licensed public utilities to buy no less than $75 \%$ of their natural gas needs from sources within the state as long as their needs could be met. Muni-Power, an out-of-state supplier, brought suit against North Pacific challenging this statute.

The best constitutional argument Muni-Power could make is that the statute violates:

(A) The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(B) The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(C) The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

(D) The Commerce Clause.

\section{Question 102}

Paul sues Daniel for personal injuries that Paul suffered as a result of a battery committed on Paul by Daniel. Daniel's defense is that it is all a case of mistaken identity. Daniel admits that Paul was beaten up, but claims he had nothing to do with Paul's injuries. At trial, Daniel testified in his own behalf that on the date that Paul suffered his injuries, Daniel was on an extended vacation in England, 2,000 miles away from the place where the battery occurred. Paul's attorney did not cross-examine Daniel regarding that testimony. In rebuttal, Paul's attorney calls Walter, who is willing to testify that one week after Paul suffered his injuries, Daniel said to Walter, "I haven't been out of the country in five years."

Walter's testimony is:

(A) Admissible as a statement against interest by Daniel.

(B) Admissible as a prior inconsistent statement of Daniel.

(C) Admissible as an admission by Daniel.

(D) Inadmissible, because Daniel was not given an opportunity to comment on the statement prior to Walter's testimony.

\section{Question 103}

In which of the following circumstances would Defendant most likely be guilty of common law murder?

(A) Defendant and Nate are having an argument, and Nate punches Defendant. Mistakenly believing that Nate intends to stab him, Defendant shoots him.

(B) At a Fourth of July celebration, Defendant fires a pistol, and the ricocheting bullet hits and kills $\mathrm{Al}$.

(C) While hunting, Defendant sees a movement. Although he cannot see what moved, he believes it to be a deer and fires into the bush. In fact, the movement was caused by George, and George is killed by the bullet fired by Defendant.

(D) During a robbery, Defendant accidentally drops a grenade. It goes off and a customer is killed. Questions 104-105 are based on the following fact situation:

Pitts purchased a new Stratton Spitfire sportscar manufactured by the Stratton Corporation from a local dealership. While Pitts was driving home from the dealership, she stopped at a red light. She was struck from behind by a truck driven by Drago, who had negligently failed to stop. On impact, the door on the driver's side of the car flew open because of a defective latch. Pitts fell out the open door and was injured. Pitts fell even though she was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the impact because the seatbelt buckle was also defective and failed to hold Pitts. Assume that a local ordinance requires all automobiles to be equipped with door latches that will not open on impact, and that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules.

104. If Pitts asserts a claim against Drago, Pitts will:

(A) Prevail, unless Stratton was negligent in the manufacture of the car that Pitts was driving.

(B) Prevail, because Drago's negligent driving was a cause in fact of the collision.

(C) Not prevail, because the door latch on Pitts's car violated a local ordinance.

(D) Not prevail if Pitts would not have been injured but for the failure of the seatbelt buckle.

105. If Pitts asserts a claim against Stratton, will Pitts prevail?
(A) Yes, unless Pitts could have discov- ered either of the defects.
(B) Yes, because the car she was driving was dangerously defective.
(C) No, because Drago's negligent driving was the cause of Pitts's injuries.
(D) No, unless Stratton knew or had reason to know of either of the defects.

\section{Question 106}

State B's legislature passed a statute that required every used car sold in the state to be tested prior to sale to determine whether it was in compliance with a set of strict exhaust emission standards that were also included in the legislation. Used cars would have to be brought up to standard and pass the emissions test prior to sale. Certain persons in the state object to the legislation because one of its results will be to raise the average price of used cars in State B. Only cars to be sold for junk are exempt from the statute.

Among the following, who would be most likely to have standing to raise a constitutional challenge to the legislation?

(A) A State B resident who was thinking about selling used cars in State B.

(B) A State B resident who was thinking about buying a used car in State B.

(C) An out-of-state dealer in used cars who had a contract to sell cars to a large dealer in State B.

(D) An out-of-state manufacturer who might be required to indemnify its dealers in State B for costs arising from the statute.

\section{Question 107}

The state of North Freedonia has long had a reputation for growing the biggest and tastiest potatoes in the country. Growers of potatoes in North Freedonia recently began spraying Bugoff onto their crops to prevent the spread of the Potato Maggot, an insect that can destroy young potato plants. Bugoff is manufactured exclusively by Growit, Inc., at its plant in South Freedonia. When the plant is producing Bugoff it emits a fine, sticky, harmless mist as a byproduct. The mist drifts over Clampett's property which is adjacent to Growit's plant. Although Growit uses the best technology available, it is unable to prevent the release of the mist. Clampett brings suit against Growit on the theory of private nuisance to enjoin the production of Bugoff at the South Freedonia plant. Which of the following facts, if established, will be most helpful to Growit's defense?
(A) Growit commenced the manufacture of Bugoff at the South Freedonia plant three years before Clampett acquired the land adjacent to the plant.
(B) Federal, state, and local agencies approved the design of the plant and equipment used to produce Bugoff.
(C) The principal users of Bugoff are State and Federal Departments of Agriculture.
(D) Bugoff is the only pesticide that can safely and effectively kill the Potato Maggot, which, if not controlled, would destroy North Freedonia's potato crop, its principal product.

Questions 108-109 are based on the following fact situation:

While Doug was driving Olivia's car, he hit Peter in a pedestrian right-of-way. Peter sued both Doug and Olivia, alleging that Doug had negligently driven the car and that Olivia had negligently permitted an unfit driver to use her car.

108. Peter calls Walter as his first witness. Walter testifies that within the last several months he is aware of three instances in which Doug has engaged in reckless driving. Both Doug and Olivia object to the admission of this evidence. The objection should be:
(A) Sustained, because Doug's character is not in issue.
(B) Sustained, because specific evidence of misconduct is not admissible to establish evidence of character.
(C) Overruled as to the case against Olivia, but sustained as to the case against Doug.
(D) Overruled, because the evidence goes to the issue of Doug's criminal negli- gence. 109. As part of her defense, Olivia calls her husband Harry to testify for her. Harry offers testimony that Olivia rarely loans her automobile to anybody, but that when she does loan it, Olivia invariably checks to see whether the driver is careful and law abiding. Peter objects to the admission of this evidence. His objection should be:
(A) Sustained, because there is no evi- dence to corroborate Harry's testi- mony.
(B) Sustained, because it seeks to prove conduct in conformity with the char- acter evidence.
(C) Overruled, because Olivia's character is in issue.
(D) Overruled, because it tends to estab- lish Olivia's habit.

Questions 110-113 are based on the following fact situation:

Owner and Builder executed a contract providing that Builder was to construct a residence on a specified location according to plans and specifications drawn up by Architect. The total contract price was $\$ 500,000$. The lot on which the residence was to be built was located on the seashore in Palm Beach, Florida and there was an existing woodframe structure that had to be demolished before the residence could be built. Owner contracted with Designer to furnish the interior of the residence after Builder completed construction, but no date was included in either contract for completion of the home. The contract between Owner and Builder stated that construction would begin within two weeks after the existing structure was demolished and the rubble removed from the lot. The contract between Owner and Builder was signed November 12, and the contract between Owner and Designer was signed November 11.

110. Assume for the purposes of this question only that the day after the preexisting structure is demolished and the rubble removed, a severe storm causes gigantic waves that erode the seashore so that Owner's lot is now under water. Must Builder still perform the contract?

(A) No, the contract is void because the subject of the contract was destroyed through no fault of the parties.

(B) No, Builder is discharged of his obligation because of impossibility of performance.

(C) Yes, if Owner obtains an alternative lot within a reasonable period of time.

(D) No, the contract is void because of mutual mistake.

111. Assume for the purposes of this question only that after Builder has completed 5\% of the residence, a severe storm causes gigantic waves that demolish the construction but leave the lot undamaged. Must Builder still perform the contract?

(A) No, the contract is void because the subject of the contract was destroyed through no fault of the parties.

(B) No, Builder is discharged of his obligation because of impossibility of performance.

(C) Yes, but he is entitled to a quantum meruit recovery for the work done prior to the destruction of the construction.

(D) Yes, Builder must perform the original contract without any compensation for the destruction of the construction.

112. Assume for the purposes of this question only that after Builder has completed $60 \%$ of the residence, a severe storm causes gigantic waves that partially erode the lot but leave the construction undamaged. Builder determines that it will cost an additional $\$ 1.2$ million to repair the lot by shoring and construction of a seawall so that the residence can be constructed according to the plans of Architect. Without the additional lot repair work, the residence cannot be constructed at all. Must Builder perform the contract?
(A) No, if the increased costs of construc- tion would bankrupt him.
(B) No, the contract is void because of mutual mistake.
(C) No, Builder is discharged of his obligation because of impracticability of performance.
(D) Yes, but he may bring an action against Owner for the increased costs of construction.

113. Assume for the purposes of this question only that after the contract was signed by the parties and after the preexisting structure has been demolished but before the rubble has been removed, the Florida Coastal Commission declares the land including Owner's lot part of a natural wilderness area, requiring that all residences constructed therein be single story and have plans approved by the Coastal Commission. The original plans called for a three-story, castle-like structure totally incompatible with the Commission's guidelines for residences in a wilderness area. Must Builder perform the contract?

(A) No, the contract is void because of mutual mistake.

(B) No, and he may recover his lost profits in an action against Owner.

(C) No, Builder is discharged of his obligation because of supervening illegality.

(D) Yes, if Owner and Architect supply new plans approved by the Coastal Commission.

\section{Question 114}

In 1951, Owner conveyed Blackacre to Brian for "so long as Blackacre is used solely for residential purposes. Should Brian ever use Blackacre for any other purpose, the interest in Blackacre shall revert to Owner and his heirs." Brian used Blackacre as his personal residence for 20 years, but in 1971, he began operating a bar on Blackacre. Owner knew that Brian was operating a bar on Blackacre, but he took no action.

In 2000, the aged Brian decided to get out of the saloon business. Brian closed his business and once again began to use Blackacre solely as his personal residence. Also in 2000, Owner died, survived by his son and only heir, Stephen. In 2002, Stephen laid claim to Blackacre.

The jurisdiction in which Blackacre is located has a seven-year adverse possession statute and another statute that bars enforcement of possibilities of reverter 55 years after their creation.

May Stephen validly claim title to Blackacre?

(A) Yes, because less than 55 years has elapsed since the creation of the possibility of reverter.

(B) Yes, because the adverse possession period began to run when Brian returned the property to residential status, and Brian has not held for the requisite seven years.

(C) No, because the adverse possession period began to run in 1971, and Brian has held the property for more than the requisite seven years.

(D) No, because Owner did not assert his possibility of reverter; thus, no cause of action arose in Owner or his heirs.

\section{Question 115}

One night when Bob was very drunk, he took one of his rifles, loaded it, and fired a bullet through his front door. Unknown to him, at the time he fired the rifle, someone was driving by the house. The bullet went through the front door, through the window of the car, and killed the driver.

Bob was convicted of murder and appeals. He contends that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of murder.

The court of appeals should rule that the evidence is:

(A) Sufficient to prove that the killing was intentional.

(B) Sufficient to prove that the killing was done with malice aforethought.

(C) Insufficient, because Bob did not know that the driver was driving by his house and therefore he could not have acted intentionally.

(D) Insufficient, because at most Bob's conduct constituted gross negligence and involuntary manslaughter.

Questions 116-117 are based on the following fact situation:

Commercial fishing, primarily for salmon and tuna, in the waters of the Pacific Ocean along the state's western boundary, has long been one of Washington's major industries. To protect the fishing industry, which was being harmed by the too rapid depletion of the fish in the waters of the state's coast, and to promote the general welfare of the state's citizens, the state legislature enacted statutes for the first time requiring licenses for commercial fishing. To receive a license, the applicant must pay a $\$ 500$ fee and establish by acceptable evidence that he has been engaged in commercial fishing in the waters of the state of Washington (including ocean waters within three miles of its coastline) since January 1, 1995. A limited number of special licenses are available for those who do not meet the requirements of the regular licenses, and these special licenses are expressly reserved for citizens who have resided in Washington for at least three years prior to the date of the application. 116. $\mathrm{Ng}$, a legally admitted alien who has been residing in the state of Washington for 10 years, brings suit in federal court to enjoin enforcement of the licensing statute as to himself and all other similarly situated noncitizen legal residents of the state of Washington. Which of the following doctrines will probably be determinative of his claims?
(A) The powers reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.
(B) The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(C) The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitu- tion.
(D) The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

117. Limpett is a commercial fisherman residing in northern California. He frequently takes his fishing boat up the coast. His favorite spot is approximately two miles off the coast of Washington. If Limpett challenges the constitutionality of the Washington statutes, the court should find the statutes:
(A) Constitutional, because Congress has not enacted legislation regarding the subject matter of the statutes.
(B) Constitutional, because economic and social regulations are presumed valid.
(C) Unconstitutional, because less restric- tive means are available.
(D) Unconstitutional, because Congress has exclusive power to regulate for- eign commerce, which includes commercial ocean fishing.

\section{Question 118}

Oliver, who owned the Rocking O Ranch in fee simple, died and left the property to his daughter, "Melinda, her heirs and assigns; but if 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

my son, Oliver Jr., is living 25 years from the date of my death, then to Oliver Jr., his heirs and assigns." At the time of Oliver's death, Oliver Jr. was one year old. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction.

The grant in the will to Oliver Jr. is:

(A) Valid, because the interest vests, if at all, within a life in being.

(B) Valid, because it grants Oliver Jr. a reversionary interest.

(C) Invalid, because the will grants Melinda the complete interest in the property, so there is nothing to be left to Oliver Jr.

(D) Invalid, if this jurisdiction does not recognize a testator's ability to convey a possibility of reverter by will.

Questions 119-121 are based on the following fact situation:

Fred is arrested and charged with the burglary of Sam's warehouse.

119. At trial, prosecution offers evidence that when Fred was arrested, shortly after the crime had been committed, he had a large amount of cocaine hidden in the trunk of his car. This evidence should be:

(A) Admitted to prove Fred's propensity to commit crimes.

(B) Admitted to prove Fred's general bad character.

(C) Excluded because such evidence may be offered only to rebut evidence of good character offered by the defendant.

(D) Excluded because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

120. At the request of the police investigating the burglary, the night watchman at Sam's Warehouse who had seen the thief leaving the premises wrote out a description of a person who bore a strong likeness to Fred. However, the night watchman died of a heart attack before Fred was arrested and brought to trial. The prosecution attempts to offer the description written out by the night watchman into evidence. The description is:
(A) Admissible as a past recollection recorded.
(B) Admissible as an identification of a person the night watchman knew committed the crime in question.
(C) Inadmissible as hearsay not within an exception.
(D) Inadmissible as an opinion of a nonex- pert.

121. On cross-examination of Fred, the prosecution asked Fred whether he had been convicted of fraudulent business practices six months earlier. This question is:
(A) Proper to show that Fred is a bad character.
(B) Proper to show that Fred is inclined to lie.
(C) Improper because the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
(D) Improper because the conviction has insufficient similarity to the crime charged.

\section{Question 122}

Dennis was charged with larceny. His principal defense was that he had no intent to permanently deprive the victim of her property. The judge instructed the jury that the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Dennis was guilty of larceny and that the evidence tended to show that Dennis had taken some jewels belonging to the victim; but if they believed that Dennis had proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he did not intend to keep the jewels, but to return them, they should find him not guilty. Dennis was convicted of larceny. He appeals the conviction, contending that the judge erred in his instructions to the jury.

Dennis's conviction will probably be:

(A) Affirmed, because the jury has the power to ignore Dennis's testimony if they do not believe him.

(B) Affirmed, because Dennis had failed to rebut the State's evidence tending to show that he intended to keep the jewels.

(C) Reversed, because the judge cannot comment at all on the evidence.

(D) Reversed, because the instructions put some of the burden of proof on Dennis.

\section{Question 123}

At the intersection of First and Main Streets, a large truck owned by Ace Meat Packing Co. collided with a car driven by Sam. At the time of the accident, Wilber, the driver of the truck, said to Sam, "The accident was my fault; I wasn't paying any attention. Don't worry, my company will make it right."' The subsequent investigation of the accident by Ace revealed that Wilber had been drinking on the day of the accident. Wilber was fired.

Sam brings an appropriate action against Ace for damages resulting from the accident. Wilber has disappeared. Sam seeks to testify as to what Wilber said at the time of the accident.

The evidence is:
(A) Admissible, as an admission by an employ- ee of the defendant.
(B) Admissible, as an excited utterance.
(C) Inadmissible, because Wilber is no longer employed by Ace.

(D) Inadmissible, unless Ace authorized Wilber to speak on its behalf.

\section{Question 124}

Alice owned Lot A, and Barry owned the adjacent Lot B. Both lots were located in State Red, which has a 20 -year adverse possession statute. In 1970, Alice married and left State Red to reside in State Blue. Alice did not return to view the property during her period of residence in State Blue. In 1971, Barry built a driveway on Lot B. The driveway extended three feet over onto Lot A. Barry mistakenly believed that this three-foot strip of land was his property. Barry regularly used the driveway and continued to use it when Alice, having been widowed, returned to State Red in 2002 . Alice discovered the encroachment upon her return.

If Alice consults you as to her rights against Barry, how should you advise her?

(A) Alice has no action against Barry, because Barry's title to the three-foot strip has been established by adverse possession.

(B) Alice has no action against Barry, because her prolonged absence from State Red establishes a presumption of abandonment of her rights in the property.

(C) Alice has an action against Barry, because Alice had no knowledge of Barry's encroachment.

(D) Alice has an action against Barry, because Barry mistakenly thought the three-foot strip was his.

\section{Question 125}

Carter, a nonunion carpenter, went to work on a construction project that was involved in a labor dispute. Every morning when he arrived at work, he would be accosted by the picketers who would try to persuade him not to continue to work. One morning while Carter was trying to get to work, one of the union workers, John, stopped Carter at the gate and told him that he shouldn't go to work. When Carter insisted that

John get out of the way, John said, "Try to make me, scab!" Carter, intending to frighten John, swung his hammer at him. The head on the hammer, however, was defective and it flew off, hitting John in the face.

John sues Carter for battery. Most likely he will:

(A) Prevail, because he was struck by the hammer head.

(B) Prevail, unless he intended to provoke Carter.

(C) Not prevail, because the negligence of the manufacturer of the hammer was the direct cause of the injury.

(D) Not prevail, if a reasonable person would have been angered by what John had said.

\section{Question 126}

Dr. Wally, a local physician who was prominent in the community and beloved by his patients, died suddenly of a heart attack. Wally was only 46 years old at the time of his death, and so the local newspaper, The Daily Bleat, had never prepared a "pre-obituary," as it did for many prominent figures. Snoops, a reporter with The Daily Bleat, was assigned to write an obituary before the next day's edition went to press. Snoops talked briefly with Mary, Wally's widow, and then called State Medical School, from which Wally had always said he had graduated. As it was late in the afternoon, all the professors were out on the golf course; thus, Snoops spoke with Nina, a secretary in the office of the dean of the medical school. When asked about Wally, Nina replied, "I don't think Wally ever graduated."

In Snoops's obituary, which appeared in the next morning's Daily Bleat, Snoops had written that Wally had never actually received a medical degree from State Medical School. Upon reading the obituary, Mary broke into tears and then became very angry, for she had worked hard to help put Wally through State Medical School, from which Wally had, in fact, graduated with high honors. Wally's executor, Eddie, was equally incensed. Both Eddie and Mary called The Daily Bleat, demanding a retraction. The next day, on the front page, The Daily Bleat admitted its error and stated that Wally graduated with high honors from State Medical School. They also fired Snoops. Nonetheless, both Eddie and Mary sued The Daily Bleat for defamation.

What is The Daily Bleat's best defense?
(A) There was no malice on the part of the defendant.
(B) The newspaper's retraction negated any harm.
(C) Snoops got his information from a secre- tary at the Medical School.
(D) Wally is dead.

Questions 127-128 are based on the following fact situation:

Christine and her friend Zelda were going away to college and had quite a few personal belongings to transport. Christine's father offered to drive them in his van, but when the van was loaded they discovered there was only room for two people, so Christine asked her boyfriend Harry to drive her in his car while Christine's father and Zelda rode in the van.

About halfway to the college, while the van and Harry's car were driving down the freeway, the van in front, the van suddenly swerved out of control and ran off the highway, ending up on its side in the center divider. When Harry stopped his car and Christine ran to the van, she discovered to her horror that her father was dead. Zelda appeared to be injured, but not severely. Because her father previously had heart trouble, Christine assumed that he had had a heart attack while driving, although a later investigation would reveal that the accident was caused solely by a defect in the steering mechanism of the van. Filled with remorse, Christine told Zelda, "I'm so sorry about this. I'll make good any losses you suffer because of this accident." Later, when Christine learned that Zelda was going to seek treatment from Dr. Winston, she wrote the doctor a letter stating that she would be responsible for all of Zelda's medical expenses; Dr. Winston received the letter the next day.

127. Assume for purposes of this question only that several months after the accident, but within the applicable statute of limitations, Zelda discovered that she had suffered an injury to her spinal column that would prevent her from ever playing basketball again. Zelda had been a scholarship athlete in basketball at the college and was considered to be a certain high draft selection for the newly formed women's professional basketball league when she graduated. She brought an action against Christine for several million dollars in damages. Which of the following is the best defense Christine could assert against Zelda's claim?

(A) There was no consideration supporting her promise to Zelda to make good any losses.

(B) She did not intend to offer to pay Zelda for the loss of her professional career when she said she would make good any losses.

(C) She was in error when she assumed that her father's heart attack was the cause of the accident.

(D) She did not know that Zelda would not be able to play basketball when she offered to make good any losses.

128. Assume for purposes of this question only that, after treating Zelda for her injuries until she recovered, Dr. Winston sent Christine a bill for services rendered. When Christine refused to pay, Dr. Winston brought an action to recover the amount of her bill. Who will prevail?

(A) Dr. Winston, because she gave medical treatment to Zelda after receiving Christine's letter. (B) Dr. Winston, because Christine's promise to pay Zelda's medical expenses was in writing.

(C) Christine, because there was no consideration for her promise to Dr. Winston.

(D) Christine, because she derived no benefit from the medical services rendered to Zelda.

Questions 129-130 are based on the following fact situation:

Ben and Sandy, brother and sister, received a $\$ 50,000$ inheritance from their deceased father. By mutual agreement, they used the money to purchase a 10 -acre parcel of land. Ben and Sandy took title as joint tenants. Three years after the purchase, Ben suggested to Sandy that they build an apartment house on the property. Sandy rejected this idea. Ben then asked if he could build an apartment house on his half of the property; Sandy agreed. Ben then built an apartment house on the eastern five acres of the property. Six months later, Sandy gave permission to the Boy Scouts of America to use the western half of the property as a site for weekend camping trips. Two years later, Ben died, leaving his entire estate to his son, Steven.

129. In an appropriate action to determine the respective interests of Sandy and Steven in the property, if Steven is judged to be the owner of the eastern five acres of the property, the most likely reason for the judgment will be that:

(A) Sandy's conduct during Ben's lifetime estopped her from asserting title to the eastern half of the property.

(B) The taking of title as joint tenants does not conclusively presume that the property is held as joint tenants.

(C) The joint tenancy was terminated by the oral agreement of Ben and Sandy at the time it was made. (D) A joint tenant may will away his interest in property, provided it is passed on to a lineal descendant.

130. In an appropriate action to determine the respective interests of Sandy and Steven in the property, if Sandy is adjudged to be the owner of all of the property, the most likely reason for the judgment will be that:
(A) The Statute of Frauds prevents the enforcement of Sandy's oral agree- ment.
(B) The record title of the property as joint tenancy can be changed only by a duly recorded instrument.
(C) Ben could not unilaterally sever the joint tenancy.
(D) Ben's expenditure of funds in building the apartment house in reliance on Sandy's oral promise estops her from denying the oral permission.

\section{Question 131}

The state legislature of Nevada enacted legislation prohibiting the use of tractor-trailer rigs weighing more than 100,000 pounds gross, after lengthy hearings demonstrated to the legislators' satisfaction that superheavy trucks rapidly degrade the state's roadways and pose a greater safety danger than smaller trucks. Western States Freight, a trucking firm that frequently uses Nevada highways for trips between Colorado and California, has recently purchased several tractor-trailer rigs weighing over 100,000 pounds when loaded. Most of its equipment may still be legally used in Nevada, but the firm does not want to have to exclude the superheavies from the California runs and plans to gradually replace its older trucks with larger models. Western brings an action for declaratory relief in federal court in Colorado, seeking to have the Nevada legislation declared unconstitutional. The state of Nevada asserts that the legislation is justified as an exercise of the state's police power based upon safety considerations, and that the court may not second-guess the state legislators as to this subject. None of the evidence presented at the legislative hearings is produced in court. Western presents expert testimony that the heavier trucks are no less safe than smaller models.

The trial court should rule:
(A) That the legislation is an unconstitutional violation of Western's Fourteenth Amend- ment rights to due process of law.
(B) That the legislation is unconstitutional because it violates the Commerce Clause.
(C) That the legislation is a valid exercise of the state's police power to regulate high- way safety.
(D) That the evidence of the damage done to the state's highways by the superheavy trucks is sufficient to uphold the legislation independently of the safety argument.

Questions 132-133 are based on the following fact situation:

Baxter was heavily in debt and was concerned that his home was about to be repossessed. To try to generate money to satisfy his creditors, Baxter promised to pay his friend Dunn $\$ 100$ if Dunn would enter Baxter's house that evening and take his expensive color television and stereo. Baxter explained that he would then report the items as being stolen to the insurance company and collect a settlement from them. Baxter gave Dunn directions to his home, which was one of several tract houses in a fairly new development. Baxter told Dunn to arrive at approximately 9 p.m. and to enter through a window at the rear of the house that Baxter would leave ajar. Dunn knew that since Baxter lived alone, there was no possibility that he might find someone within the house when he arrived at the appointed time. Dunn arrived at the location at approximately 9 p.m., but due to the darkness of the evening and the fact that all of the homes in the development looked the same, he mistakenly entered the house belonging to Baxter's neighbor. He found a window ajar at the rear of the neighbor's home and pushed it open. He entered and took the neighbor's television set and stereo. When he returned to the bar where Baxter was waiting for him, both men were arrested by the police.

132. If Baxter and Dunn are tried for conspiracy, the court will most likely find them:
(A) Not guilty, because Dunn failed to take Baxter's property.
(B) Not guilty, because Dunn, being in the wrong house, could not take Baxter's property.
(C) Guilty, because they actually took the neighbor's property.
(D) Guilty, because they intentionally agreed to defraud the insurance company.

133. If Dunn is charged with burglary, his best argument for acquittal would be that:
(A) He acted under a mistake of law.
(B) There was no breaking.
(C) There was no entry.
(D) He reasonably thought that he was in Baxter's home.

Questions 134-135 are based on the following fact situation:

Allan invited all of his neighbors to a July 4 th party in his backyard. Practically the entire neighborhood showed up, except for Clem, who lived next door. Clem was an elderly man with a known heart condition who chose not to participate in neighborhood social functions. That evening, after a full day of festivities and much beer drinking, someone at the party suggested, "We ought to set off some fireworks!" Bob, another guest, thereupon produced a large skyrocket, which he lit. However, the skyrocket failed to climb properly and crashed into Clem's garage, starting a fire. Clem rushed out of his house and attempted to put out the flames, but he suffered a heart attack and was rendered unconscious. The garage burned to the ground before the fire department arrived. Fortunately, however, the firefighters were able to revive Clem, and he has since recovered from the heart attack. A local ordinance made it a misdemeanor to sell fireworks within the city limits.

134. If Clem sues Allan for the damage to his garage, the theory on which he is most likely to prevail is that:
(A) Allan failed to exercise due care to control the acts of his guests.
(B) Allan is strictly liable for harm result- ing from ultrahazardous activities performed on his land.
(C) Clem had been invited to Allan's party; as an invitee, Allan owed him a duty to discover and guard against activities on his land involving an unreasonable risk of harm.
(D) Allan is liable on a negligence per se theory because of the local ordinance banning the sale of fireworks within the city.

135. If Clem sues Bob for the damage to his garage on a theory of negligence, which of the following arguments, if sustained by the facts, would be most helpful for Bob to avoid liability?
(A) The setting off of skyrockets on July 4 th is an accepted custom in the community.
(B) The skyrocket was aimed by Bob to avoid crashing into Clem's garage.
(C) The fire that started would have burned itself out but for the fact that Clem's garage was built out of sub- standard, highly flammable material.
(D) Bob was a guest on Allan's property and entitled to the same restricted scope of liability as Allan. 

\section{Question 136}

Vincent, who operated a local neighborhood liquor store, was robbed by a man wielding an unusual knife with a pearl-studded handle. Davis was arrested and charged with armed robbery of Vincent. At trial the prosecution calls Wilma to testify that, three days after the robbery of Vincent, she was robbed by Davis with a knife that had a pearl-studded handle.

The court will most likely hold that Wilma's testimony is:
(A) Admissible, as showing habit.
(B) Admissible, as establishing an identifying circumstance.
(C) Inadmissible, because it is improper char- acter evidence.
(D) Inadmissible, because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

\section{Question 137}

A state penal statute makes it a misdemeanor to "willfully shut off the gas, electricity, or any other form of power for cooking, heating, or illumination to an inhabited dwelling" unless strictly outlined procedures for notice and hearing are met. Shelley owned several small, single-family residences in City, which she rented to various student groups and families. One such rental, a small, furnished two-bedroom house located in one of the poorer sections of City, had been rented to a young married couple for several months when Shelley failed to receive the monthly rent check. She drove by the house several times for two weeks and received no answer to her knocks. Neighbors told her that they had not seen the couple for at least three weeks. Finally, Shelley used her keys to enter the house. She discovered that the old set of dishware and utensils she had permitted the couple to use was still in the kitchen, but that there was no food in the house and all but a few old items of clothing had been removed from the closets. Concluding that the couple had abandoned the rental without paying the last month's rent, Shelley called the power company and had the electricity and gas shut off until she could find another tenant.

A week later, the couple returned from an extended visit to the young wife's sick mother in Mexico. When they found that their power had been turned off, they reported this to the authorities and Shelley was prosecuted under the misdemeanor statute. At trial, it was established that the couple had inadvertently failed to place the proper postage on the rent check, which they had mailed from Mexico, and it had eventually been returned by Mexican postal authorities to the wife's mother's residence.

Shelley will probably be:

(A) Convicted, because the charged crime is violation of a public safety statute, and she is strictly liable for her action in turning off the power.

(B) Convicted, because she did not undertake a more thorough inquiry or wait a more reasonable length of time before concluding that the house had been abandoned.

(C) Acquitted, if the trier of fact concludes that Shelley was reasonable in believing that the house had been abandoned.

(D) Acquitted, if the trier of fact concludes that the young couple was negligent in not placing proper postage on the rent check mailed from Mexico.

\section{Question 138}

When Sandra graduated from high school, her elderly Aunt Mildred asked her to come and live with her in the large, three-story brownstone owned by Mildred in Manhattan. Mildred had recently had hip replacement surgery and could no longer attend to even minor household activities, and needed assistance in caring for the several thousand orchids she cultivated in her rooftop greenhouse. Mildred said to Sandra, "I probably have about five years left, so if you will live here and take care of me and my flowers for the rest of my life, this house and the flowers will be yours." Sandra agreed, and moved from her parents' home in Yonkers to the brownstone in Manhattan.

Mildred lived for eight years after Sandra came to live with her. Sandra attended to Mildred's personal needs, an increasing necessity as Mildred grew more frail. Sandra also maintained the household, did the shopping, cooking, etc., and cared, with less and less assistance from Mildred, for the numerous orchids. Mildred's moderate income from her investments provided the money necessary to support the household.

No further discussion was ever had between Mildred and Sandra regarding conveyance of the brownstone and its contents. Shortly after Mildred died, Sandra was contacted by a Mr. Cramer, who identified himself as Mildred's lawyer and stated that he was in possession of Mildred's last will and testament and would seek to have it admitted to probate. In the subsequent proceedings, it was revealed that Mildred had devised her orchids to a Nero Wolfe, also residing in Manhattan, and her investments, the house, and the remainder of her estate, to her daughter who lived in California and whom Mildred had not seen or heard from in over 15 years. When Sandra refused to vacate the brownstone or surrender the orchids, Cramer, now representing Mildred's daughter, brought action for possession of the house.

If Sandra prevails in the action brought by Mildred's daughter, it will be because:

(A) She can successfully assert the doctrine of "unclean hands" to prevent Mildred's daughter from pressing her claim under the will.

(B) The Statute of Frauds need not be satisfied as between family members.

(C) The Statute of Frauds will not bar enforcement of Mildred's promise because her promise induced Sandra to perform, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement. (D) The Statute of Frauds will not be applied where there has been part performance and where that performance is such as can be explained by the existence of the asserted contract and in no other way.

\section{Question 139}

Hines and West had been dating for many years. They decided to live together and some day, should things work out, get married. Since each earned a sizable income, they decided to invest some of their money in real estate. They purchased Blackacre for $\$ 100,000$, each contributing half the purchase price from savings. They took title as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Two years later, Hines and West were married. One year after that, the parties separated. Hines then quitclaimed all of his interest in Blackacre to his brother, Brown, who duly recorded the deed. The jurisdiction has no applicable statute.

Blackacre is now held by:

(A) West and Brown, as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

(B) West and Brown, as tenants in common.

(C) Hines and West, as tenants by the entirety.

(D) Hines and West, as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

\section{Question 140}

Sonny was arrested for shoplifting. As Sonny was being booked at the police station, Sonny's mother, Betty, arrived at the station. As she was talking with Sonny, Photog, a reporter for the Daily News, took Betty's picture. The photograph of Betty appeared on the front page of the next day's edition of the Daily News. The story of Sonny's arrest appeared just below it. A caption to the photograph identified Betty as Sonny's mother. Later that week, Betty lost her job as a result of the story in the Daily News.

If Betty asserts a claim against the Daily News for invasion of privacy, Betty most likely will: 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

(A) Recover, if she was not involved in the events that led to Sonny's arrest.

(B) Recover, because the photograph and news story caused Betty to be discharged from her employment.

(C) Not recover, since Betty's photograph was taken in a public place.

(D) Not recover, because the caption was accurate.

\section{Question 141}

In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be guilty of common law murder?

(A) As a joke, Defendant trips Tom as he walks by. As a result of the fall, Tom hits his head on the corner of a desk and dies immediately.

(B) During a heated argument, Ed punches Defendant in the stomach. Angered, Defendant responds by stabbing Ed with a knife and killing him instantly.

(C) While driving home from work late one night, Defendant falls asleep behind the wheel of his automobile. His car drifts across the middle of the road, strikes a car, and the other driver is killed instantly in the collision.

(D) Angered because his neighbor is playing his stereo at a very high volume, Defendant fires a gun into the neighbor's house. The bullet strikes and kills neighbor's wife.

\section{Question 142}

The United States General Accounting Office issued a call for competitive bids for a contract to supply the National Park Service with 3,000 four-wheel drive utility vehicles; the detailed specifications for the vehicles were included in the announcement. Auto Modifiers, Inc., of the state of Midwest won the contract as low bidder and began manufacture of the vehicles. Midwest statutes require that automobiles manufactured in that state be equipped with certain antipollution devices and have a maximum displacement of 2,500 cubic centimeters. The specifications of the federal contract require Auto Modifiers to manufacture the utility vehicles without the antipollution devices and with engines with a displacement of 4,000 cubic centimeters. When the president of Auto Modifiers learns that the Midwest Attorney General's office is investigating the manufacture of the government vehicles, he instructs his legal department to take affirmative action to protect the company. Auto Modifiers then files suit in state court for declaratory relief, seeking a judicial declaration that the state statute prescribing antipollution devices and engine size may not be enforced as to it.

The court should rule:

(A) The statute may not constitutionally be applied to Auto Modifiers in this instance because to do so would violate the $\mathrm{Su}-$ premacy Clause.

(B) The statute may not constitutionally be applied to Auto Modifiers because to do so would violate the Contracts Clause.

(C) The statute may not constitutionally be applied to Auto Modifiers because to do so would violate the Commerce Clause.

(D) All of the above.

Questions 143-144 are based on the following fact situation:

Driver knew that children frequently played in the street along Elm Street. As Driver was operating his vehicle along Elm Street, he saw a ball roll into the street. A few seconds later, Child darted out into the street after the ball. Pedestrian, a passerby, saw Driver's vehicle bearing down on Child. Concerned that Child would be hurt, Pedestrian rushed into the street to try to save Child. Just as Pedestrian reached Child, Pedestrian tripped and fell down in the street. Driver's car struck both Pedestrian and Child, and both were injured. The jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules. 143. Assuming that Child is four years old, will Child prevail in a personal injury suit against Driver?
(A) Yes, because Driver knew that chil- dren played in Elm Street.
(B) Yes, unless Driver was going no faster than the posted speed limit.
(C) No, because Child negligently darted into the street.
(D) No, because Child's parents were negligent in not properly supervising Child.

144. If Pedestrian sues Driver for personal injuries, who will prevail?
(A) Driver, because Driver could not have expected an adult to run into the street.
(B) Driver, if he was traveling no faster than the posted speed limit.
(C) Driver, because Pedestrian was unre- lated to Child.
(D) Pedestrian, if Driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.

\section{Question 145}

Howard and Wendy were engaged and looking for a lovely lot on which to build their dream house. They fell in love with Blueacre at first sight and purchased it, taking title as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Before construction of the dream house could begin, Howard discovered that Wendy was having an affair with Claude, and the engagement was called off. Wanting to obtain the money to run off with Claude, Wendy wanted to sell Blueacre. Howard refused to sell. Wendy put Blueacre up for sale anyway, and when Tim agreed to purchase it, Wendy forged Howard's signature on the deed conveying Blueacre to Tim.

Who owns Blueacre?
(A) Howard only.
(B) Tim only.
(C) Howard and Tim as tenants in common.
(D) Howard, Wendy, and Tim as tenants in common.

\section{Question 146}

The large metropolitan areas of East Rabbit's Foot and West Rabbit's Foot, Wyoming, lie adjacent to each other on the county line separating, respectively, Pecos and Tuscaloosa Counties, each city being entirely within its respective county. Wyoming state law grants each county great autonomy in setting the health standards governing the preparation, packaging, transportation, and sale of foodstuffs. The Pecos County council recently enacted an ordinance, valid under the constitution and statutes of Wyoming, prohibiting the packaging and sale of any food item in any nonbiodegradable material; the ordinance defines nonbiodegradable and specifically lists as prohibited all forms of plastics, cellophane, or similar materials. The ordinance specifically exempts from its terms sales of food to public institutions such as hospitals, jails, and schools.

Snak-Mart, a retail food seller in East Rabbit's Foot, files an appropriate court action attacking the Pecos County ordinance on the grounds that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court should rule:

(A) For Snak-Mart, because the state's interests could be effectuated by alternative methods less intrusive upon Snak-Mart's constitutional rights.

(B) For Snak-Mart, because no compelling state interest is served by the challenged ordinance.

(C) For Pecos County, because the state may regulate in this area as Congress has not entered the field.

(D) For Pecos County, because the ordinance is rationally related to a legitimate state interest-the health and safety of its citizens. Questions 147-148 are based on the following fact situation:

On January 1, Fred executed and delivered a deed to his daughter, Diane, conveying his avocado ranch as follows: "To Diane for life, but if Diane dies survived by her spouse and children, then to Diane's spouse for life, with the remainder in fee simple to Diane's children; but if Diane dies survived by her spouse and no children, then to my son Sam in fee simple."

On June 15, Diane married George and as a wedding gift Fred quitclaimed his interest in the avocado ranch to George. Assume that the jurisdiction does not follow the doctrine of destructibility of contingent remainders.

147. On December 1, Diane died without children and without a will. The applicable law of intestate succession provides that George is Diane's only heir. Sam claims that George has no interest in the land. Title to the avocado ranch is held by whom?

(A) George, because of the doctrine of merger.

(B) George, because Diane died intestate and her fee simple passed to him as her intestate heir.

(C) Sam, because the interest granted to Diane's spouse is void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.

(D) Sam, because Diane, although survived by her spouse, died without children.

148. Assume for the purposes of this question only that Diane died survived by George and two children, Ann and Bradley. Bradley dies intestate two days after Diane, leaving one child, Curtis, as his only heir. What are the respective interests of George, Ann, and Curtis in the avocado ranch?

(A) George has a life estate, Ann has an absolutely vested remainder, and Curtis has nothing. (B) George has fee simple ownership of the ranch, and Ann and Curtis have nothing.

(C) George has a life estate, and Ann and Curtis have absolutely vested remainders.

(D) George has a life estate, and Ann has a vested remainder subject to open.

\section{Question 149}

Nimrod, who held a hunting license issued by the state of West, was hunting deer and elk in that state. After two days of fruitless hunting, Nimrod spied an elk. Nimrod was hunting on private land, but the elk was 200 yards away, inside a fence that surrounded a federal military base. Nimrod shot the elk from where he was standing, but entered the military base to retrieve the carcass. Nimrod took the carcass away and had it dressed and frozen for Nimrod's meals through the winter. A federal statute prohibits the removal of wild animals or the carcasses thereof from United States military bases. Nimrod is prosecuted under the statute.

The best argument in favor of upholding the statute as constitutional would be based on:
(A) The Supremacy Clause.
(B) The Army and Navy Clause.
(C) The Commerce Clause.
(D) The Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Questions 150-151 are based on the following fact situation:

Cheryl is on trial for fraud, it having been alleged that she participated in an illegal scheme in which her victims were invited to become local distributors for a supposed cosmetics manufacturer. The victims were given bonus payments, after they had made a large initial "investment," for additional distributors who they would bring to the manufacturer. Cheryl's defense is that she knew nothing of the scheme. She claims she was brought into the scheme by the purported head of the manufacturer's sales department and was just following instructions to bring additional distributors into the sales force.

150. The prosecution intends to call Darryl, who will testify that Cheryl had talked him into making an investment in a similar scheme involving household products, rather than cosmetics, five years ago. Should the trial court admit this evidence over Cheryl's objection?

(A) No, because evidence of other acts or wrongs is not admissible to prove character and action in conformity therewith.

(B) No, because it is irrelevant.

(C) Yes, because it is evidence of Cheryl's character for dishonesty.

(D) Yes, because it is evidence of Cheryl's state of mind.

151. The prosecution calls Zeke as a witness. Zeke is a former business associate of Cheryl's, and he testifies that her reputation in the community is for frequently participating in very questionable transactions, usually resulting in heavy losses for her investors. He testifies further that he thinks she is dishonest. Should the trial court admit this evidence over Cheryl's objection?

(A) No, because the prosecution cannot initiate evidence of the accused's character.

(B) No, because use of Zeke's opinion is improper.

(C) Yes, because it is evidence of Cheryl's character for dishonesty.

(D) Yes, because it is evidence of habit. Questions 152-157 are based on the following fact situation:

In early January 2004 , representatives of MacDougall Corporation, makers of the famous "MacDougall Dog" hot dog and related convenience foods sold through thousands of owned and franchised "MacDougall's" restaurants, met with representatives of Time Management, Inc. ("TM"), a firm specializing in time-and-motion studies of labor intensive industries. After extensive negotiations, it was orally agreed that TM would redesign the food production area of MacDougall's restaurants, including modification of cooking equipment, if necessary, so that, using existing MacDougall's food products, savings in labor costs through reduction in restaurant cooking staffs would result. Lawyers for MacDougall's subsequently drafted a written agreement, sent it to TM, whose lawyers modified the draft, and returned the modified draft to MacDougall's. This modified writing, signed by both parties, stated in its entirety:

Provided that at least 2,000 work-hours per restaurant are eliminated, MacDougall Corporation will pay to TM within 90 days of installation of new food production systems at MacDougall's restaurants in Richmond a first installment of \$1 million. Upon installation of new food processing systems nationwide, MacDougall Corporation will pay to TM a second and final installment of $\$ 1.5$ million. Nationwide installation must be completed by January 15,2005 . Any amendments to this agreement must be in writing signed by both parties.

TM immediately began work on the restructuring of MacDougall's food processing methods. On September 5, 2004, a radical change in the layout of MacDougall's kitchen area and new personnel assignments had been designed, and TM demanded payment of the first installment payment of $\$ 1$ million. MacDougall Corporation refused, but negotiations conducted between the parties resulted in an oral agreement that MacDougall's would pay $\$ 750,000$ immediately and then the $\$ 1.5$ million second 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

installment as originally agreed, after nationwide installation of the new system.

The restructured food production system was installed and in operation in all Richmond MacDougall's restaurants on October 1, 2004. Subsequent audits revealed that the new system enabled MacDougall Corporation to eliminate 1,500 work-hours per restaurant, saving the corporation $\$ 90,000$ in labor costs for all Richmond restaurants. The new system required that MacDougall's increase the length of the famous "MacDougall Dog" by three centimeters and that the "Mother MacDougall Hot Apple Fritters" be made in a rectangular shape rather than the traditional round form. Nationwide installation of the new system in all MacDougall's restaurants was completed on January 30, 2005. The 1,500 work-hours per restaurant savings to MacDougall Corporation was projected at $\$ 1.8$ million per year. TM sent a certified letter to the chief executive officer of MacDougall Corporation requesting his certification that the new food production system was in place and operating as promised, and demanding the $\$ 1.5 \mathrm{mil}$ lion second installment. The CEO refused to so certify and refused to make any payment, noting in his reply letter that the system had not been installed by January 15,2005 , and that it did not use existing MacDougall's food products, as promised by TM.

152. Was TM entitled to payment of the first installment when it completed design work on the new system on September 5, 2004?

(A) No, because substantial completion of installation of the system in Richmond restaurants would be a constructive condition precedent to MacDougall's duty to pay.

(B) No, because the phrase "within 90 days of installation" would be interpreted to mean within 90 days after installation.

(C) Yes, because September 5 was "within 90 days of installation" of the food processing system on October 1, 2004. (D) Yes, because TM had completed work on designing the new system and could expect to install it within 90 days.

153. Assume for the purposes of this question only that TM brings an action for breach of contract against MacDougall Corporation seeking as damages $\$ 1.5$ million. MacDougall's attempts to introduce the testimony of its chief negotiator describing the oral agreement with TM representatives that the new food processing system would use existing MacDougall's food products. TM objects, arguing that the parol evidence rule bars admission of this testimony. Which of the following is the best argument supporting admission of the testimony?

(A) The memorandum signed by the parties was not a complete integration of their agreement.

(B) The parol evidence rule does not bar evidence interpreting a written agreement.

(C) MacDougall Corporation detrimentally relied on the oral agreement in signing the memorandum.

(D) The parol evidence rule does not exclude misrepresentations.

154. Assume for the purpose of this question only that the new food processing system had eliminated 2,000 work-hours per restaurant when installed. Does the fact that nationwide installation was not completed until January 30, 2005, justify MacDougall Corporation's refusal to pay the second installment?

(A) No, because the agreement did not contain a liquidated damage clause providing for delay in completion.

(B) No, because neither party manifested an understanding that time was of the essence in the agreement. (C) Yes, because nationwide installation by January 15,2005 , was an express condition of the agreement.

(D) Yes, because the doctrine of substantial performance does not apply to commercial contracts.

155. Was the oral agreement that MacDougall Corporation pay $\$ 750,000$ to TM after September 5, 2004, a valid modification of the original agreement?

(A) Yes, because the Statute of Frauds does not bar subsequent oral modification of a written agreement to which it is applicable.

(B) Yes, because contracts for services may be orally modified, if consideration is present, despite the existence of a no-oral-modification clause.

(C) No, because it was not in writing.

(D) No, because it was not supported by consideration.

156. Assume for the purpose of this question only that the delay in completion of nationwide installation was not a breach by TM, that MacDougall Corporation could not rescind, and that the agreement that resulted in payment of $\$ 750,000$ to TM was a valid modification of the original agreement. If TM brings an action against MacDougall Corporation for breach of contract, what will be the likely outcome?

(A) TM will recover on the contract, because it substantially performed under the agreement.

(B) TM will recover on the contract, because its services saved MacDougall's $\$ 1.8$ million per year in labor costs.

(C) TM will not recover on the contract, because savings of 2,000 work-hours was an express condition that was not fulfilled. (D) TM will not recover on the contract, because MacDougall's CEO would not certify that the new system was operating as promised.

157. Assume for the purpose of this question only that an express condition of MacDougall Corporation's duty to pay the contract price failed and that TM was in breach because it failed to complete nationwide installation of the food processing system by January 15, 2005. If TM brings an action to recover the reasonable value of its services, will it likely succeed?

(A) No, because failure of an express condition precedent would excuse MacDougall Corporation of its duty to pay TM.

(B) No, because a claim for reasonable value of services would be inconsistent with a claim by MacDougall Corporation against TM for breach of contract.

(C) Yes, because MacDougall Corporation continued to use the new food processing system and was aware that TM expected to be paid for its services.

(D) Yes, because MacDougall Corporation continued to use the new food processing system and would realize $\$ 1.8$ million per year as a consequence of the contractual relationship between the parties.

\section{Question 158}

A federal statute provided for federal grants to cities that desired to reclaim and rebuild inner-city areas for multi-family residential housing. The city of Owenoak applied for funding to build housing and received a grant of $\$ 2.5$ million. After the area was prepared for construction, however, the city council decided it would greatly benefit the inner-city dwellers if, in addition to housing, commercial property was built. Thus, the Council decided to use $\$ 1.5$ 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

million for housing and to "borrow" the remaining $\$ 1$ million from the housing fund to build a commercial mall. The city resolution provided that $30 \%$ of the rental from the mall each year would go to a fund for maintenance of the housing and for funds to build additional housing. Construction had started on two high-rise residential buildings and the commercial mall when the federal court, at the request of the federal government, froze the construction accounts containing the proceeds from the grant.

In a motion by the city to release the funds, the court would most likely:

(A) Grant the motion, because the city's plan for a fund to build more residential housing substantially complies with the terms of the grant.

(B) Grant the motion, because the doctrine of preservation of state sovereignty prevents the federal government from interfering with the state's discretion in this situation.

(C) Deny the motion, because the federal government can control the expenditure of the funds since it provided the funds.

(D) Deny the motion, since the doctrine of state sovereignty has no application in this situation since the action was by the city council and not the state legislature.

\section{Question 159}

Thomas wanted to give his home to his brother, Ben. In 1995, Thomas executed a warranty deed conveying the home to Ben. Thomas then wrote a letter to Ben saying, "Dear Ben, My home is now yours." He put the letter and deed in an envelope and wrote the following on the outside of the envelope: "Kenneth, you are to give this deed to my brother, Ben, when I die. Until then, you should safeguard this envelope and the documents inside. Signed Thomas." Thomas delivered these items to his cousin Kenneth and continued to live in his home by himself. In 1997, Thomas executed a will leaving all of his property to his sister Sally.

Thomas died in January 2004 . Shortly thereafter, Kenneth delivered the envelope containing the deed to Ben, who promptly recorded the deed.

Thomas's will has been admitted to probate and Xavier is the executor. Xavier has brought an appropriate action against Ben to determine the title to Thomas's home.

The court should rule:

(A) For Sally, because the deed was not effectively delivered before Thomas died.

(B) For Sally, because the deed was not recorded before the grantor died.

(C) For Ben, because the deed effectively conveyed title when it was executed.

(D) For Ben, because Thomas no longer owned his home when he died.

Questions 160-161 are based on the following fact situation:

Jesse was a member of an extreme right-wing, paramilitary organization. While out drinking with several fellow members one evening, Jesse got into an argument with a soldier from the nearby Army base and was bested in a brief exchange of punches. Feeling humiliated, he went to a different bar and drank a considerable amount of liquor. Vowing revenge on the soldier who had beaten him, Jesse and his friends drove out to the Army base. Using infiltration tactics practiced on weekends, they surreptitiously approached what they believed to be the barracks where the soldier slept. As Jesse was climbing through the window he had jimmied, a military police officer happened by and challenged him. In a tussle with the MP, Jessie struck the MP with his own baton, killing him. Still extremely intoxicated, Jesse abandoned the idea of finding and severely beating the soldier, and staggered to a nearby armored vehicle park. Since he was a heavy equipment operator, Jesse 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS 195.}

was familiar with the operation of such vehicles, and soon was driving an armored personnel carrier through the streets of the base and then out into the city. A curious police officer followed the armored vehicle for a few blocks, then pulled alongside in an attempt to determine whether it was on official Army business. At that moment, Jesse swerved the armored personnel carrier to the left, crushing the police car as it ground to a halt. The police officer inside was killed.

The jurisdiction's statutes define murder as "the premeditated and intentional killing of another or the killing of another in the commission of robbery, rape, burglary, or arson." Manslaughter is defined as "the killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner." Criminal recklessness is "consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor's conduct." The statutory definition of burglary is identical to the common law except that the prohibited conduct need not occur in the nighttime. The jurisdiction's statutes provide that intoxication is not a defense to a crime unless it negates an element of the offense.

160. Jesse is charged with the murder of the military police officer. At his trial on this charge, the court should instruct the jury on the issue of the defense of intoxication that:

(A) Voluntary intoxication is a defense to the crime of murder if Jesse would not have killed the MP but for the intoxication.

(B) Jesse is guilty of murder despite his intoxication only if the prosecution proves by clear and convincing evidence that Jesse acted with premeditation and intentionally.

(C) Voluntary intoxication is no defense to the crime of murder.

(D) Intoxication is a defense to the crime of burglary if it prevented Jesse from forming the intent to commit a crime inside the barracks, in which case he could only be convicted of murder upon the requisite showing of intentional action and premeditation.

161. In a separate proceeding, Jesse is tried for manslaughter in connection with the death of the city police officer. The prosecution's best reply to Jesse's defense of intoxication in the charged manslaughter is that:

(A) Whether Jesse was intoxicated is not the crucial issue; whether the manner in which he was operating the armored personnel carrier was criminally reckless is determinative.

(B) Conscious risk taking refers to Jesse's entire course of conduct, including drinking with the knowledge that he might become intoxicated and perform an act that might severely injure or kill someone.

(C) Intoxication is a defense to a crime only if the intoxication is involuntary.

(D) Intoxication is not a defense to the crime charged, because at common law manslaughter is a general intent crime.

Questions 162-163 are based on the following fact situation:

Jack, a 17-year-old high school student living at home with his parents, decided one day to try the old practical joke he had seen so many times on television and in movies where a bucket of water is balanced on a partially open door so that the next person to enter the room through that door is drenched. Knowing that his parents were giving a dinner party that evening, Jack obtained a bucket from the tool shed, filled it with ice water, and balanced it on the partially open door of the guest bedroom, knowing that his father would take the guests' coats and wraps in there and toss them on the bed. Later that evening, Walt, an invited guest of Jack's parents, mistakenly wandered into the guest bedroom in search of the bathroom. Jack's father had decided to keep all the guests' coats in the hall closet, since there were only three couples coming to dinner. As Walt opened the door to the guest bedroom, the bucket of ice water plunged down upon him, opening a four-inch cut in his scalp. Walt was rushed to the hospital, where 12 stitches were required to close the head wound.

162. In an action by Walt against Jack and his parents for personal injuries, the court should determine Jack's culpability according to:
(A) The presumption against negligence afforded to all minors.
(B) The age, experience, and intelligence of an ordinarily prudent minor in circumstances similar to Jack's.
(C) The standard applicable to adults, since Jack is nearly grown.
(D) Strict liability, since the practical joke turned out to be so dangerous.

163. Assume for the purposes of this question only that the jury believes Jack's testimony that he did not mean to hurt anyone, and did not expect anyone other than his father to enter the room where the bucket trap was set. Jack may be held liable for:
(A) Negligence only.
(B) Negligence and recklessness only.
(C) Negligence, recklessness, and battery.
(D) Battery only.

\section{Question 164}

Opal owned a large tract of land in fee simple and subdivided 100 acres into 250 lots. She obtained all the necessary governmental approvals, and between 1991 and 2003 sold 175 of the lots.

Preston, who purchased one of the lots to build a house, received a deed containing the following provision, which was in all the deeds to these 175 lots:

It is agreed and covenanted by Opal that the property conveyed herein shall be used for a single-family dwelling only and that no structure, other than a single-family dwelling, shall be erected or maintained; further, that occupancy in any dwelling built on this property shall be by a single family for residential purposes only. This agreement is specifically made binding on the grantee and grantee's heirs, their assigns and successors.

In 2004, Opal contracted with Fun Spa to sell an additional 100 acres that she owned contiguous to these lots. As part of this agreement, Opal conveyed to Fun Spa the 75 lots she had not previously sold. Nothing in the deeds for these 75 lots restricted their use to single-family residences, and in fact, Fun Spa was planning to use all the property purchased from Opal for a resort and for multi-family dwellings.

If Preston brought suit against Opal to establish that all the original 250 lots, including the 75 she had agreed to sell to Fun Spa, had to be used only for single-family dwellings in a proper proceeding, what would be the most likely result?

(A) Opal will prevail, because the provision in the deed only binds the grantee.

(B) Opal will prevail, because the remaining 75 deeds did not contain this provision.

(C) Preston will prevail, if he can show that a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.

(D) Preston will prevail, unless the evidence shows that Fun Spa was not aware of this provision at the time of its agreement with Opal.

\section{Question 165}

The Bedford City Council enacted an ordinance regarding the right to parade in the streets of Bedford. The ordinance provided that city officials should automatically issue a parade permit to any group filing the proper papers with city authorities, except in situations where a prior group had already received permission to parade on the same street at the same time on the same day. Another city ordinance prescribed fines for persons conducting a parade in the city of Bedford without a permit.

The Reverend Jim, leader of the Poor People's Association ("PPA"), filed appropriate papers with city officials to parade down Main Street in the city of Bedford at 1 p.m. on July 15 . City officials checked their records and noted that they had already issued a parade permit to the Little League Baseball Supporters to conduct a parade on Main Street at 1 p.m. on July 15 . The officials told Jim that he could not have a parade permit for the time and place requested and suggested that Jim select another day and/or location. Jim refused and told the city officials, "This is yet another insult to the poor from this administration. We poor people will march on Main Street any time we please, with or without your permits!" On July 15 at 1 p.m. both Little League and PPA assembled on Main Street and began to parade. There was much confusion. City officials asked Jim and his followers to desist, but they refused. Jim and other PPA supporters were arrested, convicted, and fined under the city ordinance.

If Jim and other convicted PPA members seek to have their convictions overturned by the federal courts, they will:

(A) Lose, because Jim should have gone to federal court to secure PPA's rights before violating the ordinance.

(B) Lose, because the Bedford ordinances are a reasonable restriction on time, place, and manner of speech and were not applied in a discriminatory manner.

(C) Lose, because the Bedford ordinances represented the will of the people as expressed through the city council. (D) Win, because the Bedford ordinances, on their face, violate the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment.

\section{Question 166}

Which of the following would the court be least likely to take judicial notice of?

(A) The birthdate of the plaintiff's son is June $14,1974$.

(B) The defendant has filed 25 frivolous lawsuits in the same court in which the case is being tried.

(C) It rained in the city in which the parties reside on March 28, 1987.

(D) Independence Day is July 4, and it is a state holiday.

\section{Question 167}

Prentiss was a salesman and assistant manager of Pretty Petals, a retail florist. He was employed by Lilac, the owner of Pretty Petals. Lilac owned the land and building. A large wholesale nursery was located directly across the street from Pretty Petals. Although other effective fertilizers were available at comparable prices, Doreen, the owner of the nursery, liked to use "Chemgrow," a brand-name artificial fertilizer, to nourish her young plants and trees. She stored a large quantity of Chemgrow granules in a mountainous heap on an empty lot adjacent to the nursery office. The Chemgrow gave off fumes that caused Prentiss to suffer eye, lung, and sinus irritation. Occasionally, Prentiss's irritations became so bad that he had to take off from work and seek medical attention. After losing a few hundred dollars in wages and amassing a few hundred dollars in medical expenses, Prentiss sued Doreen for damages.

The court is likely to rule in favor of:

(A) Prentiss, because Doreen had equally effective fertilizers available at comparable prices to Chemgrow. (B) Prentiss, because Doreen is strictly liable for injuries caused by emissions from her property.

(C) Doreen, if the selection of Chemgrow was reasonable and it was stored in a reasonable manner.

(D) Doreen, because Prentiss is merely an employee of Pretty Petals and does not own the property upon which the shop is located.

\section{Question 168}

Bruno is on trial in federal court, charged with having sold cocaine to an undercover agent. Bruno calls Flossie to the stand, and Flossie testifies that she was with Bruno in another state on the date of the alleged drug sale. Following Flossie's testimony, the prosecution seeks to introduce the record of judgment of Flossie's seven-year-old embezzlement conviction. Bruno's attorney objects.

The court should rule the record of judgment:
(A) Admissible, as going to Flossie's credibili- ty.
(B) Admissible, provided no appeal is pending.
(C) Inadmissible, because the record is inad- missible hearsay.
(D) Inadmissible, because, for impeachment, a specific act of misconduct cannot be shown by extrinsic evidence.

\section{Question 169}

The United States entered into a treaty with Mexico whereby both countries agreed to ban hunting of the red tailed raccoon, a species of raccoon indigenous to both the United States and Mexico. The red tailed raccoon had been placed on the endangered species list of the International Wildlife Federation and other conservation groups. The raccoons tend to roam in small family groups in the semidesert lands of the western United States and northern Mexico. The raccoons freely crossed state lines and the international boundary. Laws in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico permitted hunting of the red tailed raccoons.

After the treaty was fully ratified by the United States and Mexico, a federal court would most likely hold that the state laws permitting hunting of the raccoons are:

(A) Unconstitutional, because a treaty is the supreme law of the land.

(B) Unconstitutional, because free roaming wildlife is federal property.

(C) Constitutional, because wild animals are natural inhabitants of the state, and the federal government may not take state property without consent of the state.

(D) Constitutional, under the rights reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.

\section{Question 170}

Asa was an old man who had few friends and most of whose relatives had died. One day, while Asa was studying a chess problem at the senior citizens center, a young woman asked him if he would care to play a game. The woman had accompanied her grandmother to the center. Soon the woman, whose name was Stephanie, was visiting the center regularly to play chess with Asa. They became close friends and often visited each other's homes.

Asa decided that he would like Stephanie to have his only real asset, Oldacre, the singlefamily residence in which he lived. He wrote a note to Stephanie dated December 25, 2003, stating, "Because you have been such a good friend to a lonely old man, I want you to have this house and land."' He then went to Lawyer and had Lawyer draft a deed conveying Oldacre to Stephanie. Asa validly executed the deed and gave both the note and the executed deed to the director of the senior citizens center telling him to give them to Stephanie upon his death. Asa continued to live at Oldacre until his death in July of 2004. A will Asa had executed in 1987 was admitted to probate shortly thereafter; the will left all of Asa's property to a cousin in another state. When Stephanie received the note and deed from the lawyer prior to the probate of Asa's estate, she promptly recorded the deed, and after probate, she brought an appropriate action to quiet her title to the property conveyed by the deed.

In that action, the court should find for:

(A) Stephanie, because the deed as delivered constituted a valid conveyance of Oldacre.

(B) Stephanie, because Asa's note to her constituted a valid conveyance of Oldacre.

(C) The cousin, because the deed conveying Oldacre to Stephanie was not recorded and thus was not effective until after Asa's death.

(D) The cousin, because the fact that Asa remained in possession of Oldacre rendered the conveyance in the deed to Stephanie ineffective.

\section{Question 171}

Under which of the following circumstances would the named defendant be least likely to be convicted of the charged offense?

(A) Walter, a chemical engineer, painstakingly constructs an explosive device from readily available materials and secretes it beneath the house where his ex-wife and her boyfriend are living. He waits until he is sure both have had time to get home from their jobs, and then detonates the device by remote control, totally demolishing the house. Unknown to Walter, his ex-wife and her boyfriend had impulsively decided to spend the evening at a motel downtown. Walter is charged with attempted murder.

(B) Yvette attempts to charge an expensive leather coat using a credit card that her boyfriend obtained when he stole a woman's purse. The store's electronic credit reporting system indicates the account is defunct, and the store clerk refuses to complete the transaction. Yvette is charged with attempting to obtain property by false pretenses.

(C) Hazel, seeing a well-heeled couple cross the park, decides to rob them and use the money for groceries. Hazel approaches the couple, pulls out a gun, and tells them to hand over all of their money and valuables. The couple was having an unusually bad day: they had just been mugged five minutes before and were on their way to notify the police when Hazel approached them. Consequently, they had no money or valuables. Hazel is charged with attempted robbery.

(D) Farley, a married man who believes adultery to be a felony, begins a torrid affair with Edna, his best friend's wife. Unknown to either of them, the jurisdiction they reside in has a statute that expressly makes noncriminal any sexual act between consenting adults in private. Farley is charged with attempted adultery.

\section{Question 172}

To protect the minor children living in the area, the Rock Creek Town Council enacted an ordinance that prohibited advertisements that include "a depiction of a nude person, whether male or female." Sylvester Screen owns and operates Rock Creek Video, a videotape rental shop. Screen often posts large posters to advertise movies he has available for rent. A substantial part of his business consists of the rental of "X-rated" movies. These adult tapes are kept in a separate part of the shop. In the adult tape room he hangs movie advertisements, many of them depicting nude or partially nude people. Screen does not allow minors to enter the adult tape room.

If Screen challenges the ordinance, and assuming that he has standing to sue, how will the court most likely rule? (A) For the town, because the ordinance is a valid exercise of the town's power to protect the morals of its minor citizens.

(B) For Screen, because prohibiting the posting of the movie advertisements violates his First Amendment rights.

(C) For the town, because the posters may appeal to a minor's prurient interest in sex.

(D) For Screen, because not all nudity is obscene.

\section{Question 173}

Penelope was injured when the car she was driving was struck by a truck owned by Deeco and driven by Deeco's employee, Albert. Albert was just finishing his deliveries for Deeco when the accident occurred. At the scene of the accident, Walter, a bystander, heard Albert say, "I can't believe it ... I shouldn't have had all those beers." Penelope sued Deeco for her injuries and asked Walter to testify at trial as to Albert's statement.

Walter's testimony should be ruled:

(A) Admissible, as a statement against interest.

(B) Admissible, as an admission of a partyopponent.

(C) Admissible, as an excited utterance.

(D) Inadmissible, as hearsay.

\section{Question 174}

Photog, a freelance professional photographer, went to Department Store to purchase some film. As he was leaving the store, he noticed that Actress, a well-known Hollywood starlet, was browsing through the women's clothing department in Department Store. Photog took a picture of Actress in the clothing department without Actress's knowledge. Several days later, Photog took the photograph to the manager of Department Store and sold him the picture, explaining that Actress had agreed that Department Store could use the photograph in an advertising campaign. The manager enlarged the photograph and hung it above the main entrance to Department Store with a caption that read, "The store where Actress shops." One month earlier, Actress had entered into a contract with Hardware Store, the terms of which provided that Hardware Store had the exclusive right to use Actress's name and likeness for advertising purposes. As a result of the photograph's appearing at Department Store, Hardware Store canceled its contract with Actress.

If Actress asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against Department Store, will Actress prevail?

(A) Yes, because Department Store, without Actress's permission, used Actress's picture for profit.

(B) Yes, because Photog had no right to take Actress's picture.

(C) No, because Department Store believed it had permission to display Actress's picture.

(D) No, because Actress would clearly qualify as a public figure.

Questions 175-176 are based on the following fact situation:

Alice owned Red Acre, a tract of land with a one-story house on it. Alice leased Red Acre to Betty for a term of three years. Betty and her teenage son, Norm, planned to live in the house for this period. Norm was a star baseball player for the local high school team. To provide Norm with an adequate place to practice, Betty installed a fully operational batting cage in the backyard located on Red Acre. In addition to the batting cage, Betty installed an automatic pitching machine and electric lights so that Norm could practice at night. Six months after Alice leased the premises to Betty, Alice mortgaged Red Acre to State Bank to secure a loan. Betty was not notified directly of the mortgage but the mortgage was recorded. Six months before the three-year term was to end, Alice defaulted on her mortgage payments, and State Bank began foreclosure proceedings, as it was entitled to do on the terms of the mortgage. Although unaware of the mortgage proceedings, Betty knew that her lease with Alice was about to end; she therefore began to remove all of the equipment she had installed in the backyard. State Bank brought an action to enjoin the removal of the equipment, naming both Betty and Alice as defendants in the suit.

175. If the court refuses the injunction, it would be because:
(A) The circumstances reveal that the equipment was installed for Betty's (Norm's) exclusive benefit.
(B) The Statute of Frauds precludes the bank from claiming any interest in the equipment.
(C) Betty was never given direct notice of the mortgage.
(D) In the absence of a contrary agree- ment, a residential tenant is entitled to remove any personal property she voluntarily brings upon the premises.

176. If the equipment concerned had been installed by Alice, but the facts were otherwise unchanged, the effect of the State Bank's prayer for an injunction would be that the:
(A) Likelihood of the State Bank's suc- ceeding would be lessened.
(B) Likelihood of the State Bank's suc- ceeding would be improved.
(C) Likelihood of the State Bank's suc- ceeding would be unaffected.
(D) Outcome of the litigation would depend on whether the mortgage expressly mentioned personal property located on the premises.

Questions 177-178 are based on the following fact situation:

Civil service rules, which have been on the books in the city of Charlesville for many years, provide that any member of the police department must serve a one-year probationary period before he or she will be considered a permanent employee. In fact, this rule was enacted before Charlesville had a police academy, and now a prospective police officer spends six months in the academy before being hired by the city. Ruby, a graduate of the police academy, was with the city police department for eight months when she was terminated. There were no city ordinances or state laws that required that Ruby be given a reason for the termination or a hearing, and she was given neither.

177. Ruby brought suit against the city in the state court because of the termination of her employment. Which of the following would most likely give Ruby a constitutional basis to force the city to give her a statement of reasons for the termination of her employment and an opportunity for a hearing?
(A) No police officer had ever been terminated during probation except where there was actual cause.
(B) The six months she spent in the academy must be considered as part of her probation period.
(C) The budget of the police department was recently increased to allow for the hiring of additional officers.
(D) She was the only female police officer on probation and the only officer not given permanent employment.

178. Which of the following facts, if shown, gives the city of Charlesville the strongest argument for refusing to give Ruby a statement of reasons why her employment was terminated and for denying her the opportunity to contest the termination? (A) Ruby, as a female, did not perform as a police officer as well as her male counterparts.

(B) Ruby had failed to include in her application the fact that during college she was a member of a radical student organization.

(C) Ruby had not been granted permanent employment status.

(D) Ruby had graduated in last place in her class at the police academy.

Questions 179-180 are based on the following fact situation:

While it was parked on a side street, Driver's car was severely damaged by a hit-and-run accident. While the car was being repaired, Driver arranged to borrow a car from his friend, Lender, to drive until Driver's car was finished. Lender had an extra car that had not been driven for some time, which he gladly allowed Driver to use. However, when Driver picked up the car, Lender forgot to warn Driver that the brake fluid had a tendency to leak out of the brake system and needed to be replaced regularly. Lender telephoned Driver's wife, Rider, and warned her about the brake fluid problem. Rider, however, forgot to tell Driver. Shortly thereafter, Driver was driving Rider to work in the borrowed car. Driver was proceeding along at a reasonable rate of speed and within the posted speed limit. As he approached an intersection, another car, driven by Reckless, ran through the red light and into the intersection. Driver, upon seeing Reckless's car, stepped on the brakes, but the brakes failed and the two cars collided. If the proper amount of brake fluid had been in the brake system, Driver could have stopped in time to avoid the collision. Driver and Rider were injured. The jurisdiction has adopted "pure" comparative negligence.

179. If Driver asserts a claim against Reckless, Driver will:

(A) Recover only a portion of his damages, because Rider was also at fault. (B) Recover the full amount of his damages, because Driver himself was not at fault.

(C) Not recover, because Driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.

(D) Not recover, because Rider was negligent in not telling Driver about the defective brake condition, and Rider's negligence would be imputed to driver.

180. If Rider asserts a claim against Reckless, Rider will:

(A) Recover in full for her injury, because Driver, who was driving the car in which she was riding, was not himself at fault.

(B) Recover a portion of her damages, based on the respective degrees of her negligence and that of Reckless.

(C) Not recover, because Driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.

(D) Not recover, because Rider was primarily at fault for the collision.

Questions 181-183 are based on the following fact situation:

Joey escaped from prison and stole a car. He picked up a young woman hitchhiker, Jenny, and told her what he had done. Jenny was emotionally disturbed and of borderline mental retardation, but understood that the police were after Joey, and because she hated the police, she told Joey she would do anything she could to help him. To avoid the police, they drove to the mountains with Jenny doing much of the driving.

The following day, they were both very hungry. Toward evening, Joey saw Fisher camped by a stream nearby, and told Jenny, "Go down there and steal some food from his ice chest; he'll never even see you, but if he does, hit him with something heavy." When she hesitated, Joey became angry and said, "Go on, or I'll just leave you here to starve!" Jenny went down to Fisher's campsite, and had just grabbed a sandwich out of his ice chest and taken a bite out of it, when Fisher, who was 6'6" tall and weighed 250 pounds, ran back from the stream and grabbed her arm. Jenny was terrified and picked up a heavy frying pan and hit Fisher on the head; he slumped to the ground apparently dead. Joey then ran up and said, "He's dead. We'd better put him in the stream so it will look like he drowned after slipping and falling." They thereupon put Fisher in the stream without attempting to determine if he was alive or dead. Later, a medical examination showed conclusively that the blow only knocked Fisher out; he died of suffocation due to water in the lungs.

181. With respect to the stolen car, at common law, Jenny is:
(A) Liable as a co-conspirator to car theft.
(B) Liable as an accessory after the fact to car theft.
(C) Liable for compounding a felony.
(D) Not liable for any common law crime.

182. If Jenny is charged with petit theft of Fisher's food, a misdemeanor, the court should rule that:
(A) Jenny is not guilty because she was acting under the direction of Joey.
(B) Jenny is guilty because an otherwise criminal act cannot be justified by threats of starvation.
(C) Jenny is not guilty because there was no "carrying away" of Fisher's food, and hence no completed theft crime was committed.
(D) Jenny is not guilty if a reasonable person would have regarded the theft as essential to avoid starvation.

183. Assume for purposes of this question only that Joey is charged with causing the death of Fisher. If the jury believes his story that he thought Fisher was already dead before he and Jenny put the body in the stream, although he had made no effort to determine if Fisher was alive, the killing was:
(A) Excusable homicide.
(B) Voluntary manslaughter.
(C) Involuntary manslaughter.
(D) Murder, if the jury finds that a reason- able person would have determined whether Fisher was alive.

\section{Question 184}

In which of the following situations would Defendant's claim of intoxication most likely result in a finding of not guilty?

(A) Defendant is charged with battery after wounding Hal by shooting him. Defendant claims that he was too drunk to realize that anyone was in the house into which he shot.

(B) Defendant is charged with manslaughter when he hit and killed a child while riding his motorcycle. Defendant claims that he was so drunk he did not see the child in time to avoid hitting her.

(C) Defendant is charged with larceny. Defendant claims that when he took the car he was too drunk to realize that it was not his.

(D) Defendant is charged with involuntary manslaughter after her unsupervised fouryear-old child was killed in a fire at their home. Defendant claims that she was at the corner bar, drunk, when the fire occurred.

\section{Question 185}

Mom, a wealthy woman, wished to buy her son, Sylvester, an expensive Rolls-Royce for a wedding present. She visited Dealership, a Rolls-Royce dealer, several times, looked at many cars, and discussed possible sales prices with Huck, a salesman. On May 15, after much discussion, Huck and Mom signed a writing that stated, "If we can agree on price on or before June 1, Mom agrees to buy and Huck, for Dealership, agrees to sell one yellow Rolls-Royce Silver Streak, serial number XO857623." On May 20, Mom dispatched a letter to Huck stating, "I will buy the Rolls-Royce for $\$ 150,000$." On the same day, Huck dispatched a letter to Mom, stating, "I will sell the Rolls-Royce for $\$ 150,000$."

Has a valid contract been formed between Dealership and Mom?

(A) Yes, because the May 15 writing constitutes a contract with a missing price term, and that term was filled by the crossing offers.

(B) Yes, because when two crossing offers are identical in import, one will be treated as an offer and the other as an acceptance.

(C) No, because there were two crossing offers and no acceptance; hence there was no mutual assent.

(D) No, but the result would be different if Mom were a merchant.

\section{Question 186}

The legislature of State Yellow passed a "Fairness in Elections" statute. A major provision of the statute stated that "no newspaper in this state shall publish a political endorsement or an editorial favoring one political candidate or party over another on either the day of election or the day preceding the day of election." The stated purpose for the legislation was to prevent unfair attacks on candidates and to ensure that they would have time to respond to or rebut any published article prior to the election. The Yellow Press was the leading newspaper published in State Yellow. It had a high reputation regionally and was also distributed in states bordering on Yellow. The Yellow Press filed suit in federal court seeking to enjoin enforcement of the statute. The newspaper's best argument for the invalidity of the statute is which of the following?

(A) The statute unduly burdens interstate commerce, because the Yellow Press is circulated in other states.

(B) The statute unduly interferes with the Yellow Press's property interest in distributing newspapers.

(C) The statute unduly restricts the Yellow Press's freedom of speech.

(D) The statute violates the Equal Protection Clause, because restrictions are imposed merely on the basis of the day the newspaper is printed, while the same material can be printed on other days.

\section{Question 187}

Moms operated a corner drugstore. One afternoon she heard a screeching of brakes and Moms immediately rushed out of the store. She saw a car speeding off into the distance and found a badly injured Victor lying in the street. Victor gasped to Moms, "I'm going to die. The car that hit me had license number DD666!" Victor then lapsed into unconsciousness. Moms gave her information to the police, including a description of the car and Victor's comment on the license plate. Police traced the registration to Dick Devilish. Victor recovered from his injuries but now suffers permanent disabilities. Victor filed suit against Devilish for his injuries. At the trial, Victor wants to have Moms testify as to Victor's statement regarding Devilish's license number.

The court should rule that such testimony by Moms is:

(A) Inadmissible, because it is more prejudicial than probative.

(B) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. (C) Admissible, as a declaration made in belief of impending death.

(D) Admissible, as an excited utterance.

\section{Question 188}

Mary boarded a city bus. The bus prominently displayed a sign stating "No Smoking. Violators Will Be Prosecuted." Mary was tired after a long day at work, and deciding that she could not wait until she got home, she lit a cigarette. The bus driver shouted, "Read the sign, lady; put that out or get off my bus!" Mary told the bus driver, "I've had a rough day; you can go to hell," and walked to the back of the bus and took a seat. The bus driver flagged down a passing police officer and told him that Mary was smoking on the bus (which was the misdemeanor of "disorderly conduct"). Mary, meanwhile, quickly extinguished the cigarette and put the butt in her purse so that by the time the police officer had boarded the bus, she was sitting there innocently chewing a breath mint. The officer told Mary that she was charged with disorderly conduct, and then he searched her purse and the coat that she was carrying. The officer found not only the recently extinguished cigarette butt, but also a marijuana cigarette in the coat pocket. Mary was then charged with possession of a controlled substance.

At Mary's trial for possession, should the marijuana cigarette be admitted over Mary's objection?

(A) Yes, because it was obtained in a search incident to a valid arrest.

(B) Yes, because the coat was within Mary's "wingspan" or reach.

(C) No, because the arrest was invalid.

(D) No, because the police officer did not give Mary Miranda warnings.

\section{Question 189}

Shelley and Herman decided to get married. Both were in their final year of high school; Shelley was one month short of her 18th birthday, and Herman was 19 . They went to a local jeweler and looked at gold wedding bands, but saw nothing that appealed to them. When they discovered that the jeweler was himself a goldsmith and could make rings to order, they described what they were interested in and signed a purchase order for two rings; a woman's band for $\$ 500$ and a man's for $\$ 650$.

Three weeks later, the jeweler called Shelley and informed her that the rings were ready. In the meantime, she and Herman had broken up and Herman had enlisted in the Marines and been sent to another state for training. The day after her 18th birthday, Shelley went to the jeweler and told him that they would not be needing the rings. When he protested that they were custom-made and would probably not sell to anyone else, Shelley said, "All right, I've got $\$ 400$ in my savings account. I'll take my ring, but you'll have to find Herman about the other one." The jeweler had Shelley sign another purchase order for the woman's band at $\$ 400$, payment to be made by the end of the month.

When the jeweler did not hear from Shelley after another month, he brought an action for breach of contract against her. Evidence produced at trial established that the market value of the rings was $\$ 500$ and $\$ 650$ for the woman's and man's, respectively, and that the age of majority in the jurisdiction was 18.

Is the jeweler entitled to recover against Shelley?
(A) Yes, in the amount of $\$ 1,150$.
(B) Yes, in the amount of $\$ 500$.
(C) Yes, in the amount of $\$ 400$.
(D) No.

\section{Question 190}

Lynn entered into an enforceable written agreement to sell her home to Werner for $\$ 150,000$. The agreement provided that escrow would close on March 31, and on that date Lynn would provide good and marketable title to the house, free and clear of all encumbrances. On March 10, Lynn was notified by her insurance company that she had to renew her insurance policy by March 15 . Lynn immediately notified the company that she did not want the insurance renewed at that time. Consequently, when the house was destroyed by fire on March 25, it was uninsured.

On March 31, Werner refused to close and Lynn immediately brought an action against him for specific performance. In this jurisdiction, which has no applicable statute to govern this situation, the most probable result of this action would be:

(A) Werner prevails, because an implied term of all conveyances is that the property at the time of closing will be in substantially the same condition as it was at the time the contract was entered into.

(B) Werner prevails, because as the house was destroyed, Lynn would have nothing to "sell" and, therefore, could not convey marketable title.

(C) Lynn prevails, because under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk of loss was on Werner.

(D) Lynn prevails, but since the house was destroyed, she is only entitled to recover the fair market value of the land itself.

Questions 191-192 are based on the following fact situation:

Donald is being tried for the murder of Vincent, which occurred during the burglary of Vincent's house.

191. In its case-in-chief, the prosecution seeks to offer evidence that Donald, who was arrested several days after the crime, had been caught with 50 grams of cocaine in his car. This evidence will most likely be:
(A) Inadmissible, because Donald has not offered evidence of good character.
(B) Inadmissible, because it has limited probative value and is unduly prejudi- cial.
(C) Admissible, because it tends to show what Donald did with the money he stole.
(D) Admissible, because it tends to show that Donald is capable of committing serious crimes.

192. Wilson, who knew Donald, is called to testify that on the day after the robbery he saw Donald buying some groceries, and when Donald removed a large roll of money, Wilson had asked, "You didn't steal that from someone, did you?" Donald nodded. This evidence is:
(A) Admissible, as an excited utterance.
(B) Admissible, because it is not hearsay.
(C) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
(D) Inadmissible, because Donald had no reason to respond to this statement.

\section{Question 193}

The state police of New Lancashire wished to infiltrate the Aryan Consciousness Movement ("ACM"), a racist organization devoted to the goal of creating an "All White America." The New Lancashire police decided to create a new undercover position for the person who would infiltrate the ACM. The pay was substantially better than the salary of ordinary officers. Dimer, the chief personnel officer of the New Lancashire State Police, put out a memo inviting all white New Lancashire police officers to apply for the undercover position. Pendergrass had been a New Lancashire State Police officer for eight years and had received many citations for efficiency, bravery, and public service. However, Pendergrass is black, and Dimer refused to even accept his application for the undercover position, even though Pendergrass told Dimer that he was very desirous of obtaining the position.

If Pendergrass sues to require Dimer to give serious consideration to his application, should the court rule that Dimer has acted in a manner in accordance with the principles of the United States Constitution?

(A) Yes, because the state has a rational basis for using race as a qualification for the job.

(B) Yes, because the state has a compelling interest in infiltrating $\mathrm{ACM}$, to promote the general welfare of its citizens.

(C) No, because Dimer's actions were discriminatory per se.

(D) No, if there is a chance that Pendergrass might be able to win the confidence of ACM leaders.

Questions 194-195 are based on the following fact situation:

Baker had a contract with City to supply City with five computers a month for seven months. At the start of the fourth month, Baker realized that his supply of computers had dwindled to one. Baker called his normal supplier of computers but was informed that the supplier was out of computers. Baker immediately sent a fax to Stevens explaining the situation and asking for "a price quote for 20 computers to be delivered before the first of next month." Stevens responded by fax: "I can deliver 20 computers from my present stock at a cost of $\$ 2,000$ per computer." Baker responded the next day with a fax that stated: "I will buy 20 computers at a cost of $\$ 2,000$ per computer."

194. Assume no further communications between the parties. At this point has a contract been formed? (A) Yes, because Baker's fax ordering the computers was an acceptance of Stevens's offer.

(B) Yes, because Stevens's fax was an acceptance of the offer in Baker's first fax.

(C) No, because the fax sent by Baker was an offer that was never accepted by Stevens.

(D) No, because none of the communications were worded in such a way as to be definite and certain enough to be offers.

195. Assume for the purpose of this question only that a contract exists between the parties for the sale of the 20 computers. The payment provisions are $\$ 20,000$ upon acceptance of the contract, $\$ 10,000$ upon delivery of the computers, and $\$ 10,000$ when Baker receives his last payment from City. City defaults on its payments to Baker. Is Baker liable for the last payment of $\$ 10,000$ to Stevens?

(A) Yes, because the provisions only set a reasonable time for payment.

(B) Yes, because a buyer may not delegate the duty of payment.

(C) No, because an express condition for payment to Stevens has not occurred.

(D) No, because Baker has not received sufficient funds to make the payment to Stevens.

\section{Question 196}

On January 1, 2000, Red leased Whiteacre from Blue for a period of 10 years. On January 1,2005 , the state took title to Whiteacre under proper eminent domain proceedings. Which of the following statements are correct concerning the rights of Red? 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

I. Red may continue to occupy Whiteacre, as eminent domain proceedings will not affect lessees.

II. Red may not continue to occupy Whiteacre, is relieved from his obligation to pay rent to Blue, and will not share in the condemnation award.

III. Red may not continue to occupy Whiteacre, and is entitled to share in the condemnation award based on the value of the remaining five years less rent that would have been paid during that period.
(A) Only I. is correct.
(B) Only II. is correct.
(C) Only III. is correct.
(D) None of the above are correct.

\section{Question 197}

The Social Security Act provided that surviving spouses and stepchildren would be denied benefits unless the decedent wage-earner spouse had been married at least nine months prior to death. Sal married her husband, who was in apparent good health, five months before his death. Sal was denied survivor benefits by the Social Security Administration. She now brings an action to compel the Social Security Administration to award her benefits.

The decision of the court should be that:

(A) Sal should be awarded benefits, because the nine-month period is arbitrary, capricious, and without any rational justification.

(B) Sal should be awarded benefits, because the classification is an invidious scheme and violates her rights to equal protection.

(C) Sal should not be given benefits, because the nine-month period in question is reasonably calculated to achieve a permissible governmental end. (D) Sal should not be awarded benefits, because it would be an undue burden on the public treasury to allow all wives survivor benefits.

\section{Question 198}

Pops, owner of a street corner candy store, heard several gunshots and rushed out in the street. He found Velma lying on the sidewalk, bleeding profusely. She gasped to Pops, "I'm going to die. Danny Deft shot me." Velma lapsed into unconsciousness and died on the way to the hospital without uttering another word. Danny Deft was arrested and charged with the murder of Velma. At Deft's trial, the prosecution seeks to have Pops testify as to Velma's statement.

Such testimony should be ruled:

(A) Inadmissible, because it is more prejudicial than probative.

(B) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.

(C) Admissible, as a declaration made in belief of impending death.

(D) Admissible, as an excited utterance.

\section{Question 199}

A construction crew for the Municipal Telephone Company was sent out to install new fiberoptic cables at a downtown intersection on a vacant lot where an old building that had been demolished had stood. The telephone workers had to dig out the old copper cables, install new sheathing, and then connect and insert the new cables. Because they ran into some portions of the old sidewalk that had been in front of the old building and that had been buried over the years, the excavating took much longer than planned, and by the end of the day they had just finished removing the old copper cables. The foreman of 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS 209.}

the crew put up a couple of wooden barriers around the trench, which was about 12 feet deep, 6 feet wide, and 30 feet long, and posted signs on each of the barriers reading, "Open trench, do not approach."

Marcus and a few friends had been playing basketball after they got out of their seventh grade classes and passed by the excavation on their way home. Marcus could not quite make out what the signs on the barriers said in the deepening dusk, so he walked over to the nearest one and read it. His friends, who had continued walking, called for him to hurry along, and as he ran toward where they had moved ahead on the street, the soft edge of the excavation gave way and Marcus fell into the trench, severely injuring himself.

If Marcus's mother brings an action against the telephone company, what will be the probable outcome of her litigation? Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence and assumption of risk rules.

(A) She will lose, because the construction foreman posted a warning notice that Marcus read and understood.

(B) She will lose, because Marcus assumed the risk of injury when, after reading the warning notice, he carelessly ran along the trench after his friends.

(C) She will win, if the trier of fact concludes that the construction crew was negligent in leaving the open trench without additional protection for passersby.

(D) She will win, because the telephone company is strictly liable for the injuries to Marcus.

\section{Question 200}

Breeze was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon in violation of his parole. The police had reason to believe that Breeze was part of a group that had been stripping automobiles and selling the stolen parts. The police interrogated Breeze continually for 10 hours. Finally, the police threatened to have Breeze's parole revoked if he did not cooperate. Fatigued from the lengthy interrogation and afraid of going back to jail, Breeze confessed to being a member of the group involved in the theft of automobile parts. Breeze gave the police the location of a friend's garage where the stolen parts were located. Based on this confession, the police obtained a search warrant to search the garage, where they discovered a large quantity of stolen automobile parts. Breeze was prosecuted for conspiracy to sell stolen automobile parts. Before trial, he moved to prevent use of the stolen parts as evidence.

The court will most likely rule that the evidence should be:
(A) Admitted, because it was obtained pursuant to a warrant.
(B) Admitted, because Breeze had no standing to object to the search of the garage.
(C) Suppressed, because the uncorroborated statements of a criminal suspect are not a sufficient basis for a warrant.
(D) Suppressed, because it is the fruit of Breeze's involuntary statements.

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(A) If U-Pump-It prevails, it will be because the court follows the Cardozo approach to duty questions. Under Cardozo's approach in Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad, a plaintiff can recover for the defendant's breach of duty only if she can establish that a reasonable person would have foreseen a risk of injury to her in the circumstances; i.e., that she was located in a foreseeable zone of danger. Here, even assuming that Timmy breached a duty by parking his truck on the street, Bonnie was not within a foreseeable zone of danger and would not be able to recover damages under this view. (B) is incorrect because Timmy's stopping for a cup of coffee after making deliveries does not take him outside the scope of the employment relationship. Hence, if Timmy breached a duty to Bonnie, U-Pump-It would be vicariously liable for her injuries. (C) is incorrect because even if Oswald were a legal (proximate) cause of Bonnie's injuries, that would not preclude Timmy and U-Pump-It from being a legal cause as well. (D) is wrong because the fact that Timmy violated company rules by parking on the street would not prevent U-Pump-It from being liable for Timmy's actions, because he was still acting within the scope of his employment relationship.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(B) Olivia will recover the fair market value of the machine because Scarlet is liable for conversion. Conversion is the intentional interference with the plaintiff's right of possession in the chattel that is serious enough to warrant that the defendant pay the full value of the chattel. Conversion will be found if the defendant was using the chattel without permission and it was accidentally damaged, as in this case. The remedy for conversion is the fair market value of the chattel at the time and place of conversion. Thus, (B) is correct and (A) is incorrect. (C) is incorrect because that would be the remedy for trespass to chattels, which is a less serious interference than conversion. Here, an unauthorized use that resulted in damages equaling almost half the chattel's original cost is too serious an interference in nature and consequences to be only trespass to chattel. (D) is incorrect because Scarlet's lending the sewing machine without permission satisfies the intent requirement. Even though the damage was accidental, Scarlet is liable for conversion.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(C) Under a race-notice statute such as the one in this question, a subsequent purchaser is protected only if he purchases without notice of prior conveyances and records first. However, even though Madonna had notice of Presley's deed and was therefore not a bona fide purchaser, and could not have prevailed against Presley, that does not mean that a bona fide purchaser from her would not prevail against Presley. Fats was a subsequent bona fide purchaser from Madonna and recorded before Presley. Thus, Fats would prevail over Presley. Chubby, who had notice of Presley's deed when he subsequently acquired his deed from Fats, will also prevail over Presley. This is due to the "shelter doctrine," which is applied to the recording acts. Under that doctrine, once a bona fide purchaser enters the chain of events, she can subsequently deed the land to a party who had notice of the prior deed and that party is also accorded the status of a bona fide purchaser. Thus, once Fats, a bona fide purchaser, enters the picture and gets the protection of the act, he can sell to Chubby, who gets the protection of the act even though he purchased with notice. Chubby comes under the shelter doctrine. The theory behind the shelter doctrine is that it extends full protection to bona fide purchasers in that it does not limit their ability to market the property. Otherwise, if they could not sell to parties with notice, their ability to market the property would be impaired. The exception to the shelter doctrine is that it does not apply to the first purchaser with notice-Madonna. Thus, if Fats had subsequently sold to Madonna, she would not have been accorded the status of a bona fide purchaser. The reason for the exception is obvious-to 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

discourage fraud. Note also that because Chubby has a deed from Fats, he prevails over Fats. Therefore, (A), (B), and (D) are all incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(A) The testimony of a surprise witness is not inadmissible if the party against whom the testimony is offered is granted a continuance to prepare for cross-examination. Therefore, the evidence in (A) will likely be admitted. The evidence in (B) is less likely to be admitted because it is of a subsequent remedial measure which is generally inadmissible and cannot be justified in this case as showing ownership when the defendant has conclusively admitted such ownership. (C) is wrong because most likely the judge will find that the probative force of the evidence is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. (D) is not the best answer. While the evidence offered in (D) is clearly relevant, an acceptable reason for excluding the evidence would be that its probative value is substantially outweighed by needless presentation of cumulative evidence. It is possible that the evidence in (D) would be admitted, but it is not as likely to be admitted as the evidence in (A).

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(C) Although the First and Fourteenth Amendments severely limit the states' right to regulate public speech, reasonable regulations based on time, place, and manner are constitutionally permissible. (D) is thus wrong. (A) is wrong because the fact that the civic center is a place normally used for demonstrations of this type does not bar the city from restricting the demonstration; that is exactly why the city sought to impose certain limitations on these demonstrations. (B) is also incorrect, because a municipality does have the limited right to place certain limitations on a citizen's right of free speech in these circumstances, even when there is absolutely no reason to believe that the demonstration will be anything but peaceful and quiet. However, any such regulation by the city cannot be substantially overbroad (e.g., censor protected speech) or vague (i.e., be so unclear as to what is prohibited that a demonstrator is required to censor himself). The statute's provisions for terminating a parade and arresting demonstrators are too overbroad and vague to meet any legitimate state purpose. Absent any court decisions that have limited construction of the regulation so as to remove the threat to constitutionally protected expression, the statute's imprecise terms could be applied to protected speech and do not provide persons with reasonable notice as to what speech is prohibited.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(A) June will win because consideration generally is required for modification of a contract, and Carol's preexisting debt cannot serve as valid consideration. Consideration generally is necessary to modify a contract. Payment of a smaller sum than due will not be sufficient consideration for a promise by a creditor to discharge a debt unless the consideration is in some way new or different (e.g., payment before maturity or to one other than the creditor) or the amount of debt is subject to an honest dispute (and so the parties are giving up the right to litigate the amount, which is consideration sufficient to support a modification in and of itself). Here, nothing indicates that Carol gave anything new or different in exchange for the lower payment. Moreover, the amount was not in dispute. Therefore, there is no consideration supporting the modification, so the modification is unenforceable. (Note that even if the money was owed on a contract under the U.C.C., which permits modification without consideration, the modification still would be unenforceable because the modification must still have a good faith purpose and nothing in the facts indicates that the modification was made in good faith.) (B) is incorrect because the agreement was not supported by consideration. As discussed above, consideration is required to support Carol and June's agreement. Payment by Carol of a smaller sum than due is not sufficient consideration. Therefore, June is not bound by the agreement, and she may recover the $\$ 10,000$. (C) is incorrect because accord and satisfaction require that the amount of the debt be in dispute. A contract may be discharged by an accord (an agreement, supported by consideration, to accept some other performance in lieu of the performance required under the existing contract) and satisfaction (the performance of the accord agreement). A partial payment of an original debt will suffice for an accord and satisfaction where there is a "bona fide dispute" as to the claim. However, because the amount of Carol's debt was not in dispute, her payment of $\$ 80,000$ was not valid consideration for an accord agreement. Therefore, Carol's original debt has not been discharged by an accord and satisfaction, and June may recover the $\$ 10,000$. (D) is incorrect because it is irrelevant. A contract can be modified before or after the date of performance if the modification is supported by consideration. As discussed above, Carol's payment of a preexisting debt is not valid consideration for the new agreement. Therefore, June is entitled to the $\$ 10,000$ owed from the original contract, even though she agreed after the due date to settle for $\$ 80,000$.

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(C) Parafun will not be guilty of manslaughter because at common law a corporation is not responsible for the criminal acts of its employees. Common law took the position that since the corporation had no mind, it could not form the mens rea necessary for a traditional crime, and since the corporation could not be imprisoned, there was no criminal liability imposed on the corporation for the common law crimes committed by its agents. While the common law rule has been changed by statute in many jurisdictions, the question does not indicate the existence of such a statute. Absent a statute, Parafun will not be guilty of manslaughter. (A) is wrong because, as stated above, at common law a corporation would not be liable for a common law crime. In addition, at common law an employer is not responsible for the unauthorized criminal conduct of his employees. (B) is wrong. Even if criminal liability could be imposed on Parafun for the crimes of Silk, there would have to be a showing that Silk was at least reckless in causing the death. (B) seems to impose liability on Parafun without regard to the mental state of Silk. (D) is wrong. The fact that there was only a $1 \%$ chance of parachute failure would be a factor for the jury to consider in deciding whether a person acted "recklessly"; it would not as a matter of law negate criminal liability.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(C) There are many types of deeds that can be used to convey real property, some of which contain no covenants at all, such as quitclaim deeds. Thus, if Farley can show that the power of attorney did not include the power to convey a deed containing covenants, Glenda would not prevail. Thus, (A) is wrong. (D) is incorrect because although Farley did not make any specific covenants, Milton did. Farley will be held to those covenants if it is found that the power of attorney was intended to grant Milton the power to convey a deed containing covenants. (B) is incorrect because Glenda could have a claim for breach of the covenant of title and right to convey even if Farley's former wife did not bring a claim against her. The fact that she may have to defend such a suit is sufficient breach to entitle Glenda to institute an action.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(C) This answer can best be understood by examining the permissible questions first. (A) asks about a prior conviction for forgery. Under Federal Rule 609 , prior convictions of crimes requiring proof or admission of an act of dishonesty or false statement may be inquired into if they are less than 10 years old. This crime is one of dishonesty and is not too old; therefore, the question is proper. (B) is also a proper question. It goes to bias, which is always a permissible line of inquiry. (D) relates to prior bad acts for which there is no conviction. Federal Rule 608(b) permits crossexamination concerning prior bad acts if, in the discretion of the court, they are probative of truthfulness. Cheating a business partner is dishonest, and Winston is a witness not a party; therefore, this question is proper. That leaves alternative (C). If the ability to observe, relate, or recall were at issue, then this question could be a permissible line of inquiry, especially since Winston is not a party and is not likely to be prejudiced by the question. On the other hand, the probative value of the other questions is obvious. Since the other questions are all obviously right, this is the one most likely to be ruled improper.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(C) Arthur's statements I and III were false representations of material facts and therefore actionable. To establish a prima facie case of intentional misrepresentation (deceit), a plaintiff must establish (i) a misrepresentation made by the defendant, (ii) scienter, (iii) an intent to induce plaintiff's reliance on the misrepresentation, (iv) causation (i.e., actual reliance), (v) justifiable reliance, and (vi) damages. Usually, there is a requirement that the false representation be of a material past or present fact; whether the restoration was accomplished with genuine or handmade parts (statement I), or whether it contained original equipment (statement III), are statements of fact that would be very material to a potential buyer of classic cars. Hence, assuming that all the other elements of deceit are proved, both of these statements can be the basis of Arthur's claim. Statement II, on the other hand, will not support Arthur's misrepresentation claim because he cannot show justifiable reliance on the statement. As a general matter, reliance on false statements of opinion, value, or quality will be viewed as unjustified. Bud's claims that this is the "finest" restoration and "one of the two best" are statements of opinion as to quality. An exception to this rule might apply if Arthur were purchasing the car to enter into competition, or if Bud had superior knowledge of the subject matter, but here there is no indication what Arthur's plans are, and Arthur's experience with classic cars would make his reliance on Bud's opinion unjustified. Thus, (C) is correct; only statements I and III will support Arthur's claims.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(B) Under the "avoidable consequences" rule, a plaintiff has a duty to mitigate damages to avoid further injuries from the defendant's conduct. Since Herder's property was damaged in this situation, Herder's claim would be based on strict liability. As such, simple contributory negligence would not be a good defense in jurisdictions following traditional contributory negligence rules. (C) is therefore incorrect. But if the plaintiff discovers the existence of the danger and fails to act reasonably to prevent further harm from occurring, the defendant would have a good defense. (A) is incorrect because there is no balancing of utility and risk where ultrahazardous activities are involved. (D) is incorrect because Herder would have had to have known of and appreciated the risk involved when he purchased the property to constitute assumption of the risk. Thus, (B) is the only correct answer.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(A) As a general rule, a state may not retroactively alter a contract to which it is a party. While that prohibition is not absolute, legislation that reduces the contractual burdens on the state will be strictly scrutinized. Here, the legislature is simply making a choice about how to distribute resources to meet competing needs, and the impairment will be stricken. A state may repeal its own enactments, but may not do so when repeal violates a constitutional prohibition. Thus, (B) is incorrect. Sovereign immunity is not a constitutional doctrine, nor is equitable estoppel, except as subsumed in the Due Process Clause in a manner not as directly applicable under these circumstances as the impairment of contracts doctrine. Therefore, (C) and (D) are incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(B) Sandra, acting at Cole's direction, has the same privilege as Cole to make a felony arrest if there are reasonable grounds for doing so. The fact that Cole announced himself as a police officer, and that as a newspaper reporter, Sandra may have been familiar with police techniques, tends to show that her mistake, if any, would probably be reasonable. (A) is wrong; this is a misstatement of law. Since the facts indicate that Cole was a police officer, the reasonableness of her belief is irrelevant. (C) is wrong; Sandra need not have been a witness to make an arrest for a felony. (D) is wrong; this would deny Sandra the benefit of Cole's privilege to make an arrest if he has reasonable grounds to believe that a felony has been committed. In a case such as this, the citizen is privileged to the same extent as an officer.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(A) The ordinance is probably unconstitutional because it violates free speech rights under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has held that a charitable appeal for funds involves a variety of speech interests protected by the First Amendment. In one case, an ordinance that prohibited door-to-door solicitation by organizations that did not use at least $75 \%$ of their receipts for charitable purposes was struck down by the Court. The present ordinance would probably run afoul of the same rule, since in effect it prohibits all charitable solicitation absent relatively burdensome compliance with its registration provisions. The ordinance is also vulnerable because it limits the right of solicitation to those who belong to "a recognized charitable organization." (B), while a correct statement of law, does not apply in these circumstances. The question is directed toward the challenge George would mount, not one that a religious organization might pursue. (C) is incorrect. Since the First Amendment rights at issue here are fundamental, a "reasonable balance" is not enough; the government ordinance is a direct, content-based regulation, and will be subjected to strict scrutiny. (D) is incorrect because even if the prevention of fraud is a compelling state interest, the statute is not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, which is required under the strict scrutiny standard.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(B) The motion to suppress the evidence will be granted because the police did not have probable cause to search the car. When the police place the driver of an automobile under arrest, there are a number of alternatives with respect to a search of the car: (i) Regardless of the crime for which the defendant is arrested, the police can search the entire passenger area of the car as a search incident to an arrest. However, the search incident to an arrest must be conducted at the time of the arrest. (ii) If the police have probable cause to search the car-i.e., reasonable grounds for believing that a legitimate item of seizure is in the car-a search of the entire car can be made without a warrant. The search based on probable cause can be made at the time of the arrest or at a later time. (iii) If the police take the car under their control for an administrative reason (such as to get the car off the highway), they can "inventory" the items in the car under certain circumstances. In this question, the search of the car at the police station would have been valid $i f$ the police had probable cause to search the car. The question does not provide any facts that could form the basis for probable cause to search. Thus, the motion to suppress will be granted because of the lack of probable cause. (A) is wrong for two reasons: The search could not be justified as a search incident to an arrest since the arrest had been completed. Also, when conducting a valid search incident to an arrest, the police may open up a closed container within the arrestee's "wingspan." (C) is wrong because, as stated, a search incident to an arrest must occur at the time of the arrest. (D) is wrong. The police can conduct an administrative inventory if the car has been impounded by the police, and the police are, in fact, conducting an inventory of the items in the car. In this question, the car had not been impounded by the police, nor would it need to be since Dolly could drive it home. Also, it is clear from the facts that a traditional search was taking place.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(C) Sam's unconditional promise to sell created a contract even if Bob knew of Winnie's interest. When a promise is unconditional, the failure to perform according to its terms is a breach of contract. By not making his promise conditional on Winnie's consent to convey her interest, Sam impliedly undertook to obtain her consent. Therefore, the contract is enforceable. (Note that this does not necessarily mean that Bob will be able to get the car; he may have to settle for damages because of Winnie's interest.) (A) is incorrect although partially true. It is true that Sam cannot sell Winnie's half of the car without her consent; however, that does not make the contract here unenforceable. As stated above, by making his promise unconditional, Sam undertook a duty to obtain Winnie's consent to sell the car. His failure to do so is a breach of contract, but a breach does not negate a contract; it merely gives the nonbreaching party a right to certain remedies. Therefore, the contract is enforceable, even if Winnie refuses to sell her interest. (B) is incorrect because Bob's knowledge of Winnie's interest is irrelevant to the issue of the contract's enforceability. As discussed above, Sam's unconditional promise implied that Sam would obtain Winnie's consent to convey her interest in the car. Therefore, the contract is enforceable regardless of whether Bob was aware of Winnie's interest at the time he signed. (D) is incorrect because "prospective inability" is not a ground for discharge. Prospective failure of consideration occurs when a party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other party will be unable or unwilling to perform when due. The prospective inability of performance does not discharge the contract; rather, it allows the innocent party to suspend further performance until he receives adequate assurances that performance will be forthcoming. Therefore, the contract between Sam and Bob is not discharged because of prospective inability of performance.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(B) Bob can recover from Sam because Sam's statement to Bob that Winnie would not go along with the sale should reasonably be interpreted as a repudiation. Anticipatory repudiation occurs where a promisor, prior to the time set for performance, unequivocally indicates that he cannot or will not perform when the time comes. Anticipatory repudiation gives the nonrepudiator the option of suspending his performance and waiting to sue until the performance date, or to sue immediately. Here, Sam unequivocally stated that he could not deliver the car for $\$ 25,000$ because of Winnie's refusal to convey her interest. This repudiation excused Bob's tender on the date set for delivery, and gave rise to an immediate action for damages. (A) is incorrect because Bob's duty to tender $\$ 25,000$ on the date set for delivery was excused by Sam's repudiation. As discussed above, Sam's statement that Winnie would not agree to a $\$ 25,000$ sale was an anticipatory breach. Therefore, Bob's duty to tender the $\$ 25,000$ was excused, leaving Sam without a cause of action for breach. (C) is incorrect because Sam's repudiation the day after the contract was signed gave rise to an immediate action for damages. As discussed above, Sam's statement about Winnie's refusal to sell for under $\$ 40,000$ was an anticipatory repudiation. This repudiation excused Bob's duty to tender the $\$ 25,000$ and gave him the right to immediate recovery from Sam for breach of contract. (D) is incorrect because the contract was not terminated. As discussed above, Sam's statement about Winnie's unwillingness to sell the car for $\$ 25,000$ was an anticipatory breach. This repudiation excused Bob's duty to tender the $\$ 25,000$ and gave rise to an immediate action for damages. Therefore, Bob's failure to tender the $\$ 25,000$, which he no longer had a duty to do, did not terminate the contract.

\section{Answer to Question 18}

(C) It seems clear that Clara intended her grandchildren to inherit the property at some time, and that the only thing she desired was that Truman be able to live there as long as he wanted. Since Truman could conceivably live there all his life, this devise would be deemed a life estate in Truman, with a vested remainder in Sam. Sam's interest would, however, be subject to open (partial defeasance) since it was possible that Truman could have other children. At Truman's death, Sam's interest became indefeasibly vested. (A) is incorrect because the language of the will clearly does not express an intent that Truman take a fee simple absolute. (B) is incorrect because however many children Truman may have, his life would be the measuring life, and the grandchildren would inherit upon his death. Thus, this would not violate the Rule Against Perpetuities. (D) is wrong because Sam's interest was vested on his birth. It is true that it was subject to open and the time of possession was contingent on Truman's decision to live in the house, but Sam's basic remainder interest was always vested.

\section{Answer to Question 19}

(B) To prevail, Prole must show evidence of actual injury. When a defamatory statement involves a matter of public concern, the plaintiff must provide competent evidence of actual injury (i.e., presumed damages are not permitted absent a showing of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth). Actual injury is not limited to out-of-pocket loss; it may include impairment of reputation, personal humiliation, and mental anguish. Here, the reasons for the firing of the chief operating officer of a town's largest employer, and the financial health of that employer, are matters of public concern for the readership of the Middletown Herald. Hence, Prole will have to prove actual injury to prevail. (A) is incorrect because pecuniary damages are not necessary in libel cases. If not for the fact that a matter of public concern was involved, damages would be presumed. (C) is wrong even though it is a true statement. The common law rule of presumed damages is supplanted by the constitutional rules because a matter of public concern is involved. (D) is wrong because even if Prole is not a public figure, the article involved a matter of public concern, so damages will not be presumed.

\section{Answer to Question 20}

(B) The court should rule for the defendant and allow the treatise to be read and considered by the jury as substantive evidence. Although the treatise constitutes hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the surgical procedure was accepted), it falls within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. Under Federal Rule 803(18), information in treatises can be read into evidence if the treatise is: (i) relied upon by the expert or is called to his attention during cross-examination, and (ii) is established as reliable by the witness, another expert, or judicial notice. The treatise itself is not admitted into evidence, but rather the relevant section is read in. Thus, (B) is correct and (D) is incorrect. (A) is incorrect because the Federal Rules allow such evidence to be used substantively and do not limit the information to impeachment, as a number of state courts do. (C) is incorrect because the information in a learned treatise is admissible as long as it is established to be reliable; however, if the opposing party did rely on the treatise, the offering party need not otherwise establish reliability. 

\section{Answer to Question 21}

(C) The strongest possible argument here is (C) because equal protection claims are made against the federal government pursuant to the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court has held that this provision implicitly includes a requirement for equal protection. Although Portman has little chance of prevailing because only a rational basis test is used for age discrimination claims, this answer is the only possible basis for challenging the law. (A) is wrong because both constitutional provisions referring to privileges and immunities apply to state government conduct and are never used against the federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall deny any citizen the privileges or immunities of national citizenship. Article IV provides that no state shall deny citizens of other states the privileges and immunities it accords its own citizens. (B) is wrong because a "just compensation" claim will only provide him compensation for his loss of property. Even if his job is considered to be a property right, the just compensation claim would not provide him the relief he wants, which is reinstatement in his job. (D) is wrong because even though there is no express provision in Article I, Section 8, concerning this legislation, it certainly is within congressional powers.

\section{Answer to Question 22}

(C) The jury should find Diana not guilty of murder. Even though Diana was the initial aggressor, she reacquired her right to self-defense because Velma responded to Diana's use of nondeadly force with deadly force without giving Diana a chance to withdraw. (B) is therefore incorrect. (A) is incorrect because the majority of jurisdictions do not require a party to retreat. Furthermore, even in those jurisdictions that follow the retreat rule, a person is not required to retreat unless she can do so with complete safety. (D) is incorrect because a defendant can be guilty of murder even if she did not premeditate.

\section{Answer to Question 23}

(A) Because Beta recorded prior to the subsequent conveyance, Beta has the superior right to title regardless of the type of recording statute. A conveyance that is recorded can never be divested by a subsequent conveyance through operation of the recording statutes. By recording, the grantee gives constructive (or "record") notice to everyone. Hence, proper recording prevents anyone from becoming a subsequent BFP. Since Alpha's conveyance to Beta was recorded at the time of Alpha's conveyance to Gamma, Gamma cannot prevail. Gamma will clearly lose under a pure race statute because Beta recorded first. Gamma will also lose under notice and race-notice statutes because the conveyance to Beta was recorded at the time of the conveyance to Gamma. Gamma, therefore, had record notice and cannot claim the protection that these types of statutes provide for subsequent purchasers for value who take without notice. Thus, (A) is correct and (B) is incorrect. The fact that Beta is merely a donee rather than a bona fide purchaser does not mean that her recording has no effect. It is only the subsequent taker who has to be a BFP rather than a donee to utilize the recording statute. The prior grantee, regardless of her status, protects her interest by recording because it prevents anyone from becoming a subsequent BFP. (C) is incorrect because, as noted above, Beta will prevail under any type of recording act, but not necessarily because she recorded prior to Gamma's recording. If the jurisdiction has a notice statute, whether Beta recorded prior to Gamma's recording is irrelevant. Rather, it is the fact that Beta recorded prior to Gamma's purchase that gives Beta superior title in a notice jurisdiction, because Gamma would have record notice of the conveyance and thus would not qualify as a bona fide purchaser. (D) is incorrect because the quitclaim/warranty deed distinction does not affect who has title to Greekacre; that status merely affects the parties' respective causes of action and ability to recover against Alpha. 

\section{Answer to Question 24}

(B) Any person can testify to the authenticity of another's signature as long as that witness has seen the person's signature and can express an opinion regarding its authenticity. There is no requirement that the witness have seen the signature recently, and thus (A) is not the best answer, even though the length of time since the witness last saw the signature in question may go to the weight that should be given the witness's testimony. Nor is it decisive that the witness testifying regarding the signature has only seen it once. Under this circumstance, the witness's testimony may lack reliability, but that is a fact for defense counsel to bring out. Thus, (C) is incorrect. The testimony is of sufficient reliability to permit its admission. Thus, (D) is wrong.

\section{Answer to Question 25}

(A) In order to issue a valid search warrant, the magistrate must determine that there exists reasonable grounds to believe that a legitimate item of seizure is located at the place to be searched, i.e., "probable cause to search." However, a finding that the warrant was invalid because it was not supported by probable cause will not entitle a defendant to exclude the evidence obtained under the warrant if the police reasonably relied on the warrant's facial validity. Hence, (A) is correct. (B) and (D) are wrong because once the police are in the defendant's apartment with a facially valid search warrant, it is immaterial that they are unable to find the items for which the search warrant was issued, and if in their legal search they turn up other contraband, evidence of this discovery is admissible. (C) is incorrect. It is true that the length of time between the time an informant observed some facts and the time this information is given to the police is important, because the greater the time, the less chance that the facts still remain the same and, therefore, there is less probable cause to believe that the designated items are still in the place where the informant says they are. However, as discussed above, a determination that probable cause is absent will not necessarily require that the evidence be excluded.

\section{Answer to Question 26}

(C) Larson has more than an abstract interest in redressing his grievance. His right to redress, guaranteed by the state through its statutory enactment, is itself a property right. Although the legislature may elect not to confer a property interest, it may not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of such an interest, once conferred, without appropriate procedural safeguards. [Logan v. Zimmerman Brush (1982)] Thus, the state statute cannot be applied so as to deprive Larson of his property interest in using the statutory procedure for possible redress of unfair employment practices without at least affording him an opportunity for an appropriate hearing. It follows that (A) and (B) are incorrect, both because they state the wrong result and because they misstate the applicable rules. As indicated, Larson has a property interest and thus (A) is wrong. (B), in turn, describes a valid general rule but does not describe this case. The state can enact specific procedures, expect Larson to follow them, and bar the claim if he fails to do so. That is, however, not what happened here. Rather, the state itself failed to act in a timely manner, and the statutory time limit operated indiscriminately to extinguish Larson's claim. Finally, (D) is incorrect because it is too general. What happened to Larson was "unfair" because it deprived him of a property right, not because the state is required to provide any remedy, or a specific remedy.

\section{Answer to Question 27}

(C) This question involves an admission-i.e., a statement by a party (Deborah) being offered against her. An admission is not considered a hearsay statement. [Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)] Thus, (C) appears to be correct-that Walter's testimony about Deborah's statement will be admitted because it is not hearsay. (C) is not an ideal answer, though, because it is so incomplete. The fact that an item of evidence is nonhearsay does not automatically render it admissible. For example, if nonhearsay evidence is irrelevant, it would not be admissible. Thus, deciding whether (C) is the best answer requires a thorough assessment of the alternatives. (D) can be quickly discarded as incorrect. Impeachment evidence is not admissible until after the witness to be impeached has testified. It would be improper to admit Walter's testimony for the purpose of impeaching Deborah's expected testimony as to the result of her own investigation of the accident. (A) is tempting, but it is also incorrect. Normally, an out-of-court statement of a declarant, like the in-court testimony of a witness, is admissible only if it was made with personal knowledge. This requirement, however, does not apply to admissions. Thus, although Deborah's statement ("Ned just got hurt because I forgot to do my yard work") was made without personal knowledge, it will be admissible. As a party, Deborah will have ample opportunity to explain why she made the statement even though she lacked personal knowledge about the accident that injured Ned. The persuasiveness of her explanation will determine whether the jury takes her admission seriously. (B) is also incorrect. The common law requirement that lay witnesses were not permitted to give opinions, but only allowed to state facts, has been rejected in favor of a helpfulness standard. For example, Rule 701 allows lay witnesses to give testimony in opinion form as long as it is helpful to a clear understanding of the testimony or the determination of a fact in issue. Similarly, an admission is not rendered inadmissible merely because it is in opinion form. For example, a party's statement that "I was negligent"' or "It was all my fault" will be admitted into evidence as an admission. Therefore, although (C) is not an ideal answer, it is basically correct, and (A), (B), and (D) are clearly incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 28}

(C) This question requires analysis of each of the fact patterns. (A) would not be first degree murder. There was no premeditated and deliberate killing, and battery is not one of the listed crimes. Common law murder does include the situation where the actor, with the intent to cause serious bodily harm, causes the death of another person, but that would be second degree murder under the State Red statute. (B) would not be first degree murder. Here again there was no premeditated and deliberate killing and DWI is not one of the crimes listed. Common law murder does include the fact situation where the actor causes death under circumstances demonstrating an extreme indifference to the value of human life, but that would be second degree murder under the statute. (D) would not be first degree murder. Killings that take place during the heat of passion after sufficient provocation are manslaughter at common law and would not be considered a premeditated and deliberate killing under the statute. Being assaulted by another would be sufficient provocation. (C) would probably be considered first degree murder. There was premeditation and deliberation. Finding one's spouse in a sex act with another is considered sufficient provocation and, if the killing had occurred immediately (no cooling off period) while the defendant was in a rage, the crime would have been manslaughter. In (C), however, the killing did not take place immediately-the defendant purchased a gun. (C) might be debatable but it is clearly the fact situation that is most likely to be first degree murder.

\section{Answer to Question 29}

(D) The trial court's decision should be overturned. The prevailing rule is that in performing services of designing and constructing improvements on property eventually deeded to the city, a developer must accept responsibility for prededication negligence. Hence, the trier of fact should be permitted to consider evidence of Filmont's negligence. To hold otherwise would allow the developer to avoid liability merely by dedicating the grounds to a city. Thus, (A) and (B) are incorrect. (C) is incorrect because presenting evidence of a bad motive on Filmont's part is not necessary to find him liable.

\section{Answer to Question 30}

(B) This question raises several different issues: competency of witnesses, use of leading questions on cross-examination, the proper scope of cross-examination, and the probative value/prejudicial impact balancing test. Through a process of elimination, (B) emerges as the correct answer. (D) is incorrect. Under the Federal Rules, virtually all witnesses with personal knowledge are competent to testify. [Fed. R. Evid. 601] A witness is not rendered incompetent simply by having served on a jury in a prior case involving a party to the current suit. Such prior jury service might render the witness's testimony unpersuasive, but it would not make it inadmissible. (C) is incorrect because ordinarily, leading questions are permitted on cross-examination. [Fed. R. Evid. 611(c)] The prosecutor's question is a leading question, but that is perfectly permissible, especially in a case like this, where the alibi witness, Warren, is not "friendly" toward the prosecution. (A) is incorrect because cross-examination is generally limited in scope to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness [Fed. $R$. Evid. 611(b)], and the prosecutor's question is, in a roundabout way, an attempt to impeach Warren's credibility. The implication behind the question is that if Warren had served on a jury that acquitted Drew of another criminal charge, Warren would be inclined to think Drew innocent of the pending charge. Alternatively, the implication behind the question could be that Warren is the kind of person who is "soft on crime" and for that reason is not a credible witness. In either event, since the question is an attempt to impeach Warren's testimony, it is within the proper scope of cross-examination. This leaves (B) as the remaining correct answer. (B) is not unquestionably correct, because the probative value/prejudicial impact balancing test found in Rule 403 is weighted heavily toward admission of evidence. For evidence to be excluded under this balancing test, its probative value must be substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact. Nevertheless, in this case, a plausible reason for sustaining an objection to the prosecutor's question is that the probative value of the answer would be substantially outweighed by its tendency to mislead. The question and answer would inevitably let the jury know that Drew had been previously charged with a crime. This information could be highly prejudicial to his defense. Since the question and answer have little probative value (the negative inferences pertaining to Warren's credibility being very weak), it is reasonable to sustain an objection to the question on the basis that its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact.

\section{Answer to Question 31}

(B) Quack will be able to recover a reasonable price for his services. While the parties failed to agree on a material term, most courts today will imply reasonable terms if they are consistent with the parties' intent as otherwise expressed. Terms that can be supplied by a reasonableness standard include a price term for the performance of services. Unless the parties have shown at the time of contracting that they do not want a contract until they agree on a price, a reasonable price will be implied. (A) is wrong because Quack's fee is not necessarily reasonable although the court will take into account Quack's normal fee when it determines the reasonable fee. (C) is wrong because it fails to take into account that a court will imply a reasonable price term. (D) is wrong because it is irrelevant. In contract, a party need not prove that the "performing" party actually caused the performance. Mary received the performance she bargained for here-a cure.

\section{Answer to Question 32}

(D) Since there was consideration for Stu's promise, his promise is enforceable and Quack has a right to recover $\$ 25,000$. (A) is wrong because a promise to pay $\$ 25,000$ is a legal detriment. (B) is wrong because the preexisting duty rule does not apply since Stu was looking for additional consideration from Quack: Under the Quack-Mary contract, Quack agreed only to treat Mary; under the Quack-Stu contract, Quack would be paid only if he cured Mary. Moreover, it is not clear that Quack was under a duty to continue treating Mary when Stu approached Quack. (C) is incorrect because a court will not change the price agreed upon by the parties just because one party agreed to pay more than the reasonable value of the consideration that he was to receive. Furthermore, the facts do not establish that the value of Quack's services was in fact less than $\$ 25,000$.

\section{Answer to Question 33}

(C) In a race-notice jurisdiction such as West Dakota, a subsequent purchaser must have taken without notice of the earlier sale and must have been the first to record. Otherwise the recording act will not apply. Clyde was indeed the first to record, but he took with notice that the property had been sold before. It does not matter how the subsequent purchaser learns of the earlier sale; if that person knows about it, he loses. Since the recording act does not apply to protect Clyde, the common law rule of first-in-time, first-in-right gives title to Keith. Thus, (C) is correct, and (B) is wrong. (A) is not as good an answer as (C) because if the recording act did apply, Keith's receiving a deed before Clyde would not give him superior rights to Steppeacre. (D) is wrong because recording does not cure the problem of Clyde taking with notice.

\section{Answer to Question 34}

(C) When the existence of a presumed fact is submitted to the jury in a criminal case, the judge must instruct the jury that it may regard the basic facts as sufficient evidence of the presumed fact, but that it is not required by law to do so. If, as here, the presumed fact (intoxication) is an element of the offense, its existence must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the judge should have instructed the jury that it may regard a blood alcohol concentration of $.10$ or more as sufficient evidence of intoxication, not that it must do so. The instruction appears to relieve the prosecution of its burden of proving intoxication beyond a reasonable doubt. It follows that (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because a jury should be instructed on the applicable law-e.g., permissible inferences as to intoxication. (D) is incorrect because an instruction is supposed to inform the jury of the law, not be probative. The term "probative" applies to relevance of evidence, not jury instructions.

\section{Answer to Question 35}

(B) Substantially overbroad or vague statutes regulating First Amendment rights are void on their face, and persons may not be prosecuted for their violation even if their conduct might otherwise be subject to valid regulation. Conversely, statutes that reasonably regulate the time, place, and manner of speech in public forums may be unconstitutional if applied in situations where the First Amendment activity is unreasonably infringed. Here, the statute is a valid time, place, and manner restriction because it is content neutral, it is narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and it leaves open alternative channels of communication. However, it is being applied to circumstances that do not provide any reasonable basis for regulation of the speech. Thus, (B) is correct: while Roger's conduct can be regulated, it is the threat by the farmer that triggers Roger's arrest, not his violation of the statute. (A) and (D) are incorrect since the statute itself is valid on its face. (C) is incorrect, in turn, because it wrongly asserts that Roger may be prosecuted under these circumstances. 

\section{Answer to Question 36}

(B) Since Woody did not take the stand, this evidence is not being offered for impeachment and, thus, the 10-year time limit does not apply. Evidence of other crimes is admissible against an accused in a criminal case if it is relevant to some issue other than the defendant's character or disposition to commit the crime charged. Where, as here, the crime charged is embezzlement, evidence that the defendant committed embezzlement before might be admissible to establish fraudulent intent. The crimes in (A), (C), and (D) are not relevant to any issue other than character and propensity to commit a crime; therefore, they are inadmissible. The fact that (A) and (D) are felonies would be important only if this were impeachment evidence, which it is not.

\section{Answer to Question 37}

(C) The original grant by Myrtle to Cyrus was a license, which is a personal privilege to go upon the land belonging to the licensor. When Cyrus expended a substantial sum of money in reliance on the license, the license became irrevocable under the doctrine of estoppel. (A) is wrong because Myrtle was estopped from terminating the license, not just from preventing Cyrus from coming onto her land. (D) is wrong because the duration of the irrevocable license is based on what the parties contemplated would be the duration when the oral license was granted and the facts do not indicate that they intended it to exist until Cyrus acquired another source of water. (B) is wrong because the estoppel is based not on the mere construction of the ditch but the expenditure of a substantial sum of money in reliance on the license. Therefore, (C) is a better answer than (B).

\section{Answer to Question 38}

(B) It will be most relevant to determining Delbert's guilt or innocent if he was unaware that the building he broke into was a dwelling. An element of the crime of common law burglary is that the breaking and entering be of the dwelling of another; hence, awareness of the building's use as a dwelling is a component of the mens rea for the crime. Delbert's ignorance or mistake regarding the building's use as a dwelling may negate the mens rea for that element of the crime of burglary. (A) is incorrect because it is not necessary that Delbert's mistake as to the identity of the computer be reasonable. Ignorance or mistake as to a matter of fact will affect guilt only if it shows that the defendant did not have the state of mind required for the crime. While courts have required that a mistake offered to negate the existence of a general intent be reasonable, any mistake of fact, reasonable or unreasonable, is a defense to a specific intent crime. Here, burglary requires the specific intent to commit a felony inside the dwelling at the time of entry. Delbert may not have had the intent to commit a felony if he believed that he was just retrieving his own computer that had been stolen. If so, the fact that his belief was unreasonable is irrelevant; it still negates the specific intent to commit a felony. (C) is incorrect because his realization that the computer was not his after he had broken into the shop is not relevant for purposes of burglary (although he may have committed larceny under those circumstances). The intent to commit a felony must have existed at the time of entry. If the intent is formed after the entry is completed, burglary is not committed. (D) is wrong because, as discussed above, Delbert's ignorance of the building's status as a dwelling may be a defense.

\section{Answer to Question 39}

(A) The gift in trust to Rockville University is a valid charitable trust. To be valid, a charitable trust must have an indefinite group of beneficiaries. The beneficiaries must be reasonably numerous and not individually identified. The trust may be for the benefit of an established charity or for a group of persons, as long as it is for a charitable purpose. Here, a trust for the benefit of a university to pay for the educational expenses of residents of a city qualifies as a charitable trust. Thus, (A) is correct and (C) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because the doctrine of cy pres applies only when the purposes of a charitable trust are impossible to fulfill, are illegal, or have been completely fulfilled, allowing a court to redirect the trust to a different purpose that is as near as may be to the settlor's original intent. Here, because the trust purposes can be fulfilled, the doctrine does not apply. (D) is incorrect because the gift to Rockville University is certain to vest within the perpetuities period. The Rule Against Perpetuities applies to the equitable future interests of the beneficiaries in a private trust just as it does to legal future interests. Seth's three children are lives in being at the time the trust becomes effective, which is Seth's death. The executory interest in trust held by Rockville University is certain to either take effect or fail during those lives in being.

\section{Answer to Question 40}

(A) This question involves testimony by a witness, Harriet, whose recollection has been refreshed by reference to a document (her diary). Under the Federal Rules, any materials can be used to refresh one's recollection, and the Rules do not prohibit the use of such materials before trial. Thus, (A) is correct. (B) can quickly be discarded as incorrect. The contents of Harriet's diary are not remotely protected under the work product rule. The work product rule involves a product, such as a document, prepared in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial, by or on behalf of a party. Harriet is not a party, and her diary was not prepared in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial. It is, presumably, merely a collection of private thoughts transcribed for Harriet's personal edification. (D) is also incorrect. The best evidence rule does not literally require a party to produce the best evidence possible to prove a point. Rather, it requires the production of the original document when attempting to prove the contents of a document. [Fed. R. Evid. 1002] Although Harriet used a document to refresh her recollection and enable her to testify, her testimony concerned the details of an auto accident, not the contents of the document. Since Harriet was testifying about an event, as opposed to the contents of her diary, her testimony was proper, notwithstanding the failure to produce the diary. (C) is a tempting answer, but ultimately incorrect. If a witness's recollection has been refreshed prior to trial by reference to a document, the court has discretion to require that the document be disclosed to the opposing party. [Fed. R. Evid. 612] The court is not required to order disclosure. In this case, there is no indication that the court ordered disclosure of the diary or that Plee failed to comply with an order to produce the diary. All that is known is that, upon learning through cross-examination of Harriet that she had consulted her diary the night before, Def's attorney immediately moved that Harriet's testimony be stricken from the record. Since there is nothing improper about a witness's refreshing her recollection prior to trial, Def's motion should be denied and Harriet's testimony should remain on the record.

\section{Answer to Question 41}

(B) Burglary requires a breaking and entry of a dwelling of another at nighttime with the intent to commit a felony therein. Here, Defendant entered his brother's home at night with intent to take the television. A mistake as to application of the criminal law does not excuse a violation of that law. In (A), the defendant would not be guilty of burglary. There is no indication of a breaking and entering, the office would probably not be a dwelling, and, most important, defendant's belief that he owned the briefcase would negate the intent to commit a larceny or other felony. In (C), the defendant would probably not be guilty of burglary. At common law, an honest belief that you were entitled to take the property of another as repayment for a debt negated the intent necessary for larceny. In (D), the defendant would not be guilty of burglary. The garage would probably not be a dwelling and, most important, the defendant did not have the "intent to permanently deprive" necessary for larceny.

\section{Answer to Question 42}

(A) Both damages and an injunction would be in order. School has a life estate pur autre vie while Owens's children have a vested remainder subject to open. Absent an "open mine" in existence at the creation of the life estate and remainder, a life tenant cannot extract minerals from the land because it depletes the corpus and constitutes waste. Thus, the remainderman could recover damages and obtain an injunction for the unlawful waste. (B) is wrong since School's action did not terminate its interest. School's interest is not a defeasible one at all since the language that purports to restrict its use to educational purposes is only precatory and provides for no termination or forfeiture if School fails to comply. (C) is wrong because it is entirely unnecessary for Owens and Wilma to be parties since neither of them has any interest in the land. (D) is wrong because the injury to the land is permanent and therefore should be prevented by an injunction.

\section{Answer to Question 43}

(C) The general principles of intergovernmental immunity prevent federal interference with state governmental functions. Though there is not a great deal of bite left in the Tenth Amendment under current case law, particularly with regard to congressional conditions on expenditures of federal money, this is still the best argument presented. (B) is not the best answer because it goes too far; the doctrine of federalism relates to the functions of state government, not to all the actions of the state government. Clearly, the federal government could prevent the state from exercising its power in such a manner as to deprive its citizens of their federal rights, including those rights with regard to public education. (A) is obviously wrong, because the doctrine of federal preemption prevents the states from interfering with the effect and purposes of federal law. (D) is wrong because it is too narrow. Aside from the problem of separation of church and state, there are many reasons why the federal government could limit a state's rights in this area.

\section{Answer to Question 44}

(B) A contract can be reformed to reflect the original intent of the parties where there has been a mutual mistake in the integration. The plaintiff's negligence is not a bar to reformation. Here, both parties were unaware that the written contract did not reflect their agreement. (A) is not as good an answer as $(B)$ because it fails to mention the mutual mistake element. (C) is wrong because the parol evidence rule does not apply in an action for reformation; if it did, contracts could rarely be reformed. (D) is wrong because the mistake here was not unilateral.

\section{Answer to Question 45}

(A) The grounds for rescission would be the intentional misrepresentation by Quinn that the second agreement was the same as the first. (B) is incorrect because reformation requires that the agreement not reflect the intention of the parties. Here, there was never any intent on the part of Quinn to agree to the terms of the old agreement. (C) and (D) would not apply to this fact situation.

\section{Answer to Question 46}

(B) The parol evidence rule does not bar prior statements when the cause of action is for misrepresentation, which is essentially a tort action. Thus, (A) and (D) are wrong. While (C) is true, it is not as good an answer as (B) because the statements could be admitted even if the lease was not proved to be an incomplete agreement.

\section{Answer to Question 47}

(C) To recover on a theory of strict tort liability, Walter must show that his injuries were caused by an unreasonably dangerous defect in the boat that existed when the boat left City Marine's control; (C) is the only alternative that reflects this requirement. A prima facie case in products liability based on strict tort liability consists of: (i) a strict duty owed by a commercial supplier; (ii) breach of that duty; (iii) actual and proximate cause; and (iv) damages. Examples of commercial suppliers include manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers, and assemblers. Breach of duty is established by proving that the product is in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to users. A plaintiff need not prove that the defendant was at fault in selling or producing a dangerous product. To prove actual cause, a plaintiff must trace the harm suffered to a defect in the product that existed when the product left the defendant's control. Here, if the steering failed due to a defect present when the boat left the manufacturer, that defect must also have been present when Walter bought the boat from City Marine, the retailer. This defect rendered the boat unreasonably dangerous to users such as Walter. By selling the boat in such condition, City Marine breached its strict duty, and this breach actually and proximately caused Walter to incur severe personal injuries. Thus, given the additional fact in (C), Walter will prevail. (A) is incorrect because any inspection of the boat by City Marine prior to sale would be relevant to a negligence action, but not to one based on strict liability. Even if City Marine had conducted a reasonable inspection of the boat, strict liability will still lie if the boat left City Marine's control with a defect that rendered it unreasonably dangerous. (B) is incorrect because ordinary contributory negligence is not a defense in strict liability actions in jurisdictions that retain traditional contributory negligence rules. To the extent that Walter is "misusing" the boat by weaving in and out of the pylons, it is a reasonably foreseeable misuse that the commercial supplier must take into account. To avail itself of Walter's conduct as a defense, City Marine must show that Walter voluntarily and unreasonably encountered a known risk. The facts herein do not indicate any such knowing assumption by Walter of the risk of harm from the defective steering mechanism. (D) is incorrect because it does not establish the causation element. City Marine's strict tort liability depends on whether the steering mechanism failed because of a defect present at the time it sold the boat to Walter. If the boat was not defective at the time of sale, or if any defect that was present had nothing to do with the failure of the steering mechanism, City Marine will not be liable for a subsequent failure of the steering mechanism from some other cause.

\section{Answer to Question 48}

(C) Watersports, Inc. will be liable for negligence if it should have discovered the defect in the steering mechanism. To establish a prima facie case for negligence in a products liability case, plaintiff must show the existence of a legal duty owed by the defendant to that particular plaintiff, breach of that duty, actual and proximate cause, and damages. To prove breach of duty, plaintiff must show (i) negligent conduct by the defendant leading to (ii) the supplying of a defective product by the defendant. The call of the question indicates that Watersports, Inc. supplied a defective product. If the defect could have been discovered by Watersports, Inc. in the exercise of reasonable care, it was negligent in not discovering the defect and preventing the boat from being sold. Choice (A), which addresses the duty element, is incorrect because a manufacturer of boats such as Watersports, Inc. is a "commercial supplier" owing a duty of due care to any foreseeable plaintiff. Although Tom did not purchase the boat (and so was not in privity with Watersports, Inc.), he was a friend of the owner of the boat and was using it when he was injured; he is therefore a foreseeable plaintiff. (B) is incorrect because Walter's negligence would be imputed to Tom only where he and Walter stand in such a relationship to each other (e.g., an employeremployee relationship) that the courts would find it proper to charge Tom with Walter's negligence (such that Tom would be vicariously liable for Walter's negligent conduct if a third party had sued Tom). Here, the facts do not indicate any relationship that would warrant imputing Walter's negligence to Tom. Choice (D), which addresses the causation element, is incorrect because an intermediary's negligent failure to discover a defect is foreseeable negligence and therefore not a superseding cause. Watersports, Inc., the defendant whose original negligence created the defect, will still be liable.

\section{Answer to Question 49}

(C) Under the "perfect tender rule" Buyer may reject the entire shipment (III.). This power to reject is tempered by the U.C.C.'s provisions allowing Seller to "cure" defects. Although "cure" is not mentioned as an option, (C) remains a better answer than the others because I. and II. are not permissible options for the buyer at this time. With regard to I., the contract's delivery date has not yet arrived and Seller must be given an opportunity to "cure" before the Buyer seeks "cover." II. is not an option because the delivery date has not yet arrived and there is no reason to anticipate that Seller will not make good before the date in question. There is no breach until the delivery date, and an anticipatory breach situation does not exist. Hence, (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 50}

(B) Absent any anti-deficiency statutes, Olman remains personally liable to pay for any shortfall arising from the foreclosure sale. Proceeds from the sale are used to satisfy the senior interests first. Hence, all of the proceeds $(\$ 6,000)$ went to Exbank. Thus, Olman must pay the balance still due Exbank $(\$ 4,000)$ and the entire amount of the Wybank mortgage $(\$ 2,000)$, which is terminated by the foreclosure of the senior mortgage. (A) is wrong because foreclosure sales are not allotted proportionally between senior and junior interests. (C) is wrong because foreclosure does not extinguish the underlying debt. (D) is wrong because Wybank's mortgage does not remain on the land after foreclosure of the senior mortgage; hence, Olman is liable for that debt as well.

\section{Answer to Question 51}

(B) Burglary is the breaking and entering of the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony inside the house. The prosecution must prove every element of the offense, including intent, beyond a reasonable doubt. Since the trial court's instructions placed the burden of proving lack of intent on Donald, they were in error. Thus, (B) is correct, and (D) is incorrect. (A) is incorrect because it focuses on the standard of proof, when the burden of proof is the issue. (C) is incorrect because it is impossible to make the harmless error analysis without knowing more about the state of the evidence, and the test for constitutional error is "harmless beyond a reasonable doubt," not by a preponderance, as suggested by the answer.

\section{Answer to Question 52}

(C) Congress's power over interstate commerce is broad, and the federal statute is clearly authorized by that power. The Court's $5-4$ decision has no bearing here, since it was simply explaining what the standard was in the absence of any express congressional action. (A) is wrong because the fact that a state regulation does not burden interstate commerce in the absence of federal regulation does not preclude the federal government from subsequently enacting conflicting regulations which void the state law. (B) is wrong because the Fourteenth Amendment does not bind the 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

federal government, and because a regulation of interstate commerce would rarely be classified as violating equal protection as to intrastate commerce. (D) is not the best answer because the Supremacy Clause alone does not speak to the validity of a federal statute, merely to its precedence over conflicting state enactments. The Supremacy Clause would operate, accordingly, only after the new statute is enacted, and would render the West Rabbit Foot ordinance invalid.

\section{Answer to Question 53}

(B) Eric cannot recover because the cause of his injury was not a highly dangerous concealed artificial condition. Generally, the owner or occupier of land does not owe a duty to an ordinary trespasser to warn of dangerous conditions on the land or to make the land safe. Where the trespasser is an anticipated trespasser-i.e., where the landowner knows that people habitually intrude upon a particular part of her land-a duty to warn of or make safe highly dangerous concealed artificial conditions known to the landowner arises. However, there is no duty to warn of conditions so apparent that the trespasser should be able to discover them himself. Here, even though Eric qualifies as an anticipated trespasser, the wheelbarrow and shovel were neither concealed nor highly dangerous. Thus, (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because it would be irrelevant whether the landowner created the artificial condition if she were otherwise liable because she allowed the condition to remain on her land. (C) is incorrect because mere knowledge of the dangerous condition does not impose a duty to warn. (D) is incorrect because, as stated above, Shelley had no duty to warn of obvious artificial conditions.

\section{Answer to Question 54}

(A) Murray cannot obtain specific performance against Tom because the absence of a written memorandum signed by Tom and containing the essential terms of an agreement between Murray and Tom means that there is no enforceable contract. To obtain specific performance, there must be an enforceable contract between the parties. Pursuant to the Statute of Frauds, a contract for the sale of land is not enforceable unless it is evidenced by a writing signed by the party sought to be bound. In addition to this signature, the writing should contain a recital of consideration, the terms and conditions of the agreement, the identity of the party sought to be charged, and an identification of the contractual subject matter. Murray is attempting to obtain specific performance of a contract to purchase Tom's house. Thus, Murray must show the existence of a contract through a writing sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. The only writings mentioned in the facts are Murray's written offer to purchase the house and the real estate listing agreement between Tom and Fred. The latter reflects only an agreement between Tom and Fred as to the terms of Fred's services as a broker in connection with the sale of Tom's house. This in no way constitutes written evidence of an agreement between Tom and Murray. Murray's written offer was never signed by Tom and was, in fact, rejected by Tom in a manner consistent with its terms. Thus, this writing does not memorialize an agreement between Tom and Murray for the sale of Tom's house; no agreement was ever reached. Therefore, there is no enforceable contract that can be the subject of specific performance. (D) is incorrect because, as explained above, there is no memorandum signed by Tom that lists the essential terms of an agreement between Tom and Murray. In fact, there was never any such agreement, much less a writing reflecting its terms. (B) is incorrect because a purchaser of land is almost always deemed to have an inadequate remedy at law. Each parcel of land is always considered unique; i.e., unlike any other that could be purchased with the same sum of money. Thus, if Murray did have a cause of action against Tom, he would not have an adequate remedy at law. (C) is incorrect because the facts do not indicate that Fred and Tom intended that Murray or any other third person benefit by their agreement. Application of the factors that courts use to determine whether a third party is an intended beneficiary who can enforce a contract between the contracting parties or an incidental beneficiary who has no rights under the contract indicates that Murray is not an intended beneficiary. The agreement did not: (i) expressly designate a third party; (ii) indicate that performance was to be made directly to a third party; or (iii) state that a third party had any rights under the contract. Also, there is no relationship between Murray and either Tom or Fred from which it could be inferred that either Tom or Fred wished to make the agreement for Murray's benefit. Thus, Murray is not an intended beneficiary of the agreement between Tom and Fred and cannot recover on that agreement.

\section{Answer to Question 55}

(B) A public nuisance exists when a property owner is using his property in such a manner that it creates an unreasonable risk to the public in general. The owner need not be violating a specific statute in order to be a public nuisance; hence, (D) is incorrect. Nor is it determinative that the owner has a permit to engage in the activity if the owner's use otherwise constitutes a public nuisance. (Albeit, in many cases it would be hard to show a public nuisance if the owner did have a permit to use his property in a certain manner. But the facts of this case show that Evan had not complied with the provisions of the permit.) Evan would be correct in arguing that it is not a nuisance per se in storing the flammable liquids on his property since this is not a residential neighborhood; however, (C) is not the best answer because it still could be shown that under this particular situation it was a nuisance. Nevertheless, it is generally the duty of the local district attorney to bring actions to enjoin public nuisances, and private citizens will generally have no standing to bring such suit unless the private citizen can show that he suffers some special injury in addition to that sustained by the general public. The facts in this case fail to show such special injury, so (B) would be Evan's best defense.

\section{Answer to Question 56}

(B) Under the best evidence rule, in proving the terms of a writing, where the terms are material, the original writing must be produced. Secondary evidence of the writing, such as oral testimony regarding the writing's contents, is permitted only after it has been shown that the original is unavailable for some reason other than serious misconduct of the proponent. Here, the value of the house is of major importance, and the contents of the document are closely related to this central issue. Consequently, Nora, whose only knowledge of this significant litigated issue comes from having read the document, is precluded from testifying as to the contents of the document unless the unavailability of the writing is established. Destruction of the original without fault of the party offering the secondary evidence constitutes a satisfactory explanation for nonproduction of the original and justifies the admissibility of secondary evidence. Thus, (B) is a better answer than (C). (A) is incorrect because personal knowledge of the contents does not in and of itself justify admissibility of the testimony. (D) is incorrect because the appraisal document, personally prepared by Harry, constitutes an admission by a party-opponent; i.e., a prior acknowledgment by a party of one of the relevant facts. Under the Federal Rules, such statements are nonhearsay.

\section{Answer to Question 57}

(C) Joe's actions with respect to Egbert never rose to the level of attempt under either the traditional "proximity test" or the modern Model Penal Code test; here, there is no evidence that Egbert was even present. Thus, I. is incorrect, and so (A) is incorrect. Even though Joe thought Ira was Egbert, he intended to kill the person at whom he aimed (Ira). His actions with regard to Ira fulfill the test for attempt under every approach. Therefore, Joe could be convicted of the attempted murder of Ira, and II. is correct. Furthermore, Joe's intent to kill Ira is transferred to Gladys, making Joe guilty of murder. Thus, III. is correct. Therefore, choice (C) is correct, and (B) and (D) are incorrect. 

\section{Answer to Question 58}

(B) Under Rule 801 of the Federal Rules, prior identification can be admissible and the sketch could be deemed a prior identification. However, to be admissible, the witness must be there to testify at trial and be subject to cross-examination. The witness in this case is unavailable; hence, this exception does not apply. (D) is therefore incorrect. (A) applies to documentary evidence and has no relevance to this question. (C) is likewise not applicable, because this exception applies only to information within the personal knowledge of the public employee. In this case the public employee gained the knowledge from the hearsay statement of an absent witness.

\section{Answer to Question 59}

(B) Prior consistent statements are admissible to rebut a charge that the witness is lying or exaggerating because of some motive; however, since the facts in this question do not indicate that such a charge has been made against Justin, the statement is no more than hearsay. Hence, (D) is wrong. (C) is wrong because an out-of-court statement made by a witness is hearsay without regard to who made the statement. (A) is wrong because all evidence given by a witness in his own defense should be self-serving. This may go to the weight of the evidence, but it has nothing to do with its admissibility.

\section{Answer to Question 60}

(D) Justin has taken the stand in his own defense, and therefore the prosecutor can attack his credibility as a witness. Under Federal Rule 609, evidence of conviction of a crime requiring proof of an act of dishonesty or false statement can always be used to attack a witness's character for truthfulness. (A) is incorrect because even if fraud were probative of the tendency to commit violence, evidence of other crimes is not admissible to prove that a person has a propensity to commit criminal acts. (C) is incorrect for the same reason. (B) is incorrect because no foundation is needed to show a prior conviction for impeachment purposes.

\section{Answer to Question 61}

(C) Conviction of the defendant in (A) would violate the constitutional proscription against ex post facto laws. (B) is an example of attempting, with criminal intent, to do an act which is not itself a crime. (D) is an example of a person prosecuted for guilty thoughts, which is unconstitutional. The defendant in (C) could be found guilty under either of two theories. The statute could be interpreted as a strict liability statute. Under that interpretation, the defendant would be guilty because he engaged in the prohibited behavior. Alternatively, the statute could be interpreted as requiring a mens rea. Under that interpretation, he could be guilty upon a determination that he intentionally put water in a container that had held chlorine bleach.

\section{Answer to Question 62}

(D) Action having the purpose and effect of altering the legal rights, duties, and relations of persons, including executive branch officials, must be subjected to the possibility of presidential veto. [Immigration \& Naturalization Service v. Chadha (1983)] Although the President (or his predecessor) had the opportunity to veto the statute, the adoption of a joint resolution that shortens the time that the President may use the troops would have the purpose and effect of altering the rights and duties of the President, which accrue to him by virtue of his rather extensive military powers, and would not be subject to a presidential veto. For this reason the statutory provision may be an unconstitutional legislative veto of executive action. It follows that (A) and (C) are therefore incorrect. (B) is incorrect because the President does not have exclusive power over matters relating to war. Such power is shared with Congress.

\section{Answer to Question 63}

(A) Congress may delegate many of its powers to executive agencies, provided adequate standards are established to govern exercise of the delegated power. The power was properly delegated to the Secretary of Commerce because the statute "outlines" the "management efficiency standards" to be followed. (B) is incorrect because Congress has sole authority over foreign commerce; the authority is not shared with the executive branch. (C) is incorrect because the delegation is proper if adequate standards are established; as determined above, there are adequate standards here. (D) is incorrect because there is no executive impoundment here, merely a refusal to grant funds based upon standards established by Congress. Such standards are proper where, as here, Congress acts pursuant to its spending power and the standards are specified in advance.

\section{Answer to Question 64}

(D) Norris paid a fair price for Goldacre and had no knowledge of Briggs's claim to Goldacre at the time he purchased the property. He would thus qualify as a bona fide purchaser for value and, since he was the first to record, he would have priority over Briggs. (A) and (B) are incorrect because the recording act determines priority among purchasers of property while the Statute of Frauds deals only with the validity of an individual contract. (C) is incorrect because Strobe's signing the contract, which contained the same terms and conditions as Briggs's offer, constituted an acceptance, which became effective upon dispatch under the "mailbox rule" of contract law.

\section{Answer to Question 65}

(C) Wes will prevail because Luke was a gratuitous assignee of the contract between Wes and Jane, and Jane had expressly reserved the right to stop the payments at any time, which she did by making a subsequent assignment of the right to Zack. (A) is wrong because Luke had rights under the contract that he could enforce against Wes until Jane revoked the assignment. (B) is wrong because the facts do not show a change in position in reliance upon Jane's actions. (D) is wrong because Luke's right to receive the funds was limited to the period in which Jane told Wes to send the funds.

\section{Answer to Question 66}

(C) Jane had reserved the right to reassign the proceeds at any time, and had assigned them to Susan before she died. Zack's initial interest in the proceeds was subject to Jane's right to revoke by a subsequent assignment, which Zack had acknowledged. During the time Funco sold back the hotel and obligations to Wes, the proceeds were assigned to Susan; therefore, Zack's rights were not vested. (A) and (B) are wrong because there was no vesting when Funco was an obligor. Zack was not a third-party beneficiary of the original agreement between Jane and Wes; he was a subsequent assignee of Jane's rights. While he may have been a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between Wes and Funco, he did not assent to it or change his position in reliance on it; hence, his rights did not vest. (D) is wrong because the contract between Funco and Wes expressly required Funco to assume Wes's obligations. Zack was an intended beneficiary of that agreement, but his rights did not vest before they were extinguished by the subsequent assignment.

\section{Answer to Question 67}

(A) The language in the deed from McWilliams to Stone creates an express easement with Leftacre as the servient estate and Rightacre as the dominant estate. As such, Sandberg has no right to obstruct O'Toole's use of the easement. (B) is incorrect because O'Toole has an express easement, not an easement by necessity. While it is true that, in the absence of an express easement, Stone may have had a claim of an easement by necessity, an easement by necessity will not be implied when an express easement is provided. (C) is incorrect because a change in conditions and/or circumstances will not terminate an express easement. (D) is incorrect because injunctive relief is possible where a property right is involved.

\section{Answer to Question 68}

(B) The grant was for use of a dirt path, not for a 24-foot-wide paved road, and a court could easily find this burden excessive. (A) is incorrect because the easement involved is an express easement, not an easement by necessity. (C) is an incorrect statement of law; the owner of a servient estate does not have the obligation to maintain an easement and cannot unilaterally control the nature of its improvement. (D) is incorrect because a surcharging of the easement does not terminate it; it merely gives the owner of the servient estate the right to stop the additional use.

\section{Answer to Question 69}

(C) The only plaintiff who would have standing is the Society. The Society has standing because the statute causes injury to the Society itself. Disclosure of membership would affect the ability of the Society to keep and obtain members in violation of the First Amendment. Thus, it has standing to sue. I. is wrong because taxpayers have no standing to challenge federal expenditures unless the taxpayer alleges that the challenged measure was enacted under Congress's taxing and spending powers and that it exceeds a specific constitutional limitation on those powers. Here, the taxpayer made no such allegations and probably could not show that the spending violated a specific constitutional limitation. Thus, (A) is incorrect. (B) is wrong because standing cannot be based on a claim to the public at large; the group must allege some specific injury to itself or its members. IV. is wrong because general financial inability to buy is not sufficient injury; the plaintiff must show that absent the zoning, there would be a substantial probability that he could buy a home. (D) is therefore incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 70}

(B) Double jeopardy does not prohibit the imposition of cumulative sentences for two or more statutorily defined offenses specifically intended by the legislature to carry separate punishments, even though constituting the "same" crime under the Blockburger test (i.e., each offense does not require proof of some additional fact that the other does not) when the punishments are imposed at a single trial. Absent a clear intention, it is presumed that multiple punishments are not intended for offenses constituting the same crime under Blockburger. Here, it is clear that Congress, in enacting SOCA, intended that certain offenses, such as interstate distribution of cocaine, be subject to separate punishments. (B) is the only alternative that expresses the view that Dalton may be sentenced under both statutes. Thus, it is the correct answer, and (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 71}

(C) Statements in a document affecting an interest in property are admissible, pursuant to Federal Rule 803(15), if they are relevant to the purpose of the document. Thus, (B) is incorrect. (A) is incorrect because properly authenticated copies of recorded writings may be used in lieu of originals. [Fed. R. Evid. 902(4)] (D) is incorrect because the trust instrument cannot qualify as a recorded recollection; there is no witness testifying that he made or adopted the writing while the events were fresh in his mind and he has no present recollection.

\section{Answer to Question 72}

(B) (B) is correct because the swearing out of a complaint that was proper at the time may not serve as a basis for a false imprisonment action despite the failure to cancel the complaint (although in some circumstances such swearing out may give rise to an action for malicious prosecution). Thus, (C) is incorrect. (A) is incorrect because the reasonableness of Hotel's belief that Parker stole services is irrelevant. Even if Hotel's belief was unreasonable, it does not establish the intent required for false imprisonment. (D) is wrong because the absence of an adequate number of cashiers is not an act confining one within fixed boundaries, as required for false imprisonment.

\section{Answer to Question 73}

(C) It is a defense to false imprisonment that the police acted under a valid arrest warrant. The warrant was valid here, and that should serve as a complete defense. Mere statements by a defendant that he is innocent do not compel the police to follow the defendant's suggestions. It follows that (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because the police acted under a valid warrant and are not charged with knowing whether Parker actually committed the crime with which he was charged. (D) is incorrect because the reasonableness of Hotel's actions will not affect the liability of the police. Even if Hotel did not have reasonable grounds for signing the complaint, the police will not be liable because they acted pursuant to a valid warrant.

\section{Answer to Question 74}

(A) Congress has the power, under the Commerce Clause, to regulate any activity that, taken cumulatively, has substantial economic or commercial effect on interstate commerce. Although there are limits on the power of Congress to regulate commerce, in only a few cases has the Court invalidated a federal law as exceeding the scope of Congress's commerce power. Since Congress has concluded that the animal is important to the region's tourism industry, and given the comparative weakness of the other answers, (A) is the strongest argument. (B) is incorrect because the Necessary and Proper Clause must be linked with another constitutional power of Congress. Here it is presented by itself, not in connection with another power, and thus it is incorrect. (C) is incorrect because there is no federal police power. (D) is wrong. The facts of this question do not offer any facts suggesting that the animals are on federal lands. Thus, the power to regulate federal lands is irrelevant.

\section{Answer to Question 75}

(A) Larceny is the taking and asportation of the personal property of another by trespass and with the intent to permanently deprive the person of his interest in the property. Here, the moving of the mower to the loading dock constituted the taking and carrying away. Since Manfred did not have express or implied permission to move merchandise in this way, it was trespassory. Clearly, he intended to permanently deprive Gardenshop of its interest in the mower. Thus, the larceny was complete when Manfred moved the mower to the loading dock, and (B) and (D) are therefore incorrect. (C) is incorrect because to be guilty of embezzlement, Manfred would have had to have been in possession of the mower when he converted it. Since Manfred did not have especially 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

broad power over the mower and it was not given to him by a third party, he merely had custody, not possession, of the mower.

\section{Answer to Question 76}

(C) Norman must accept Kurt's performance. A contract for paving would not be regarded generally as involving a personal subject matter, thus Zelda could delegate the duties to another competent contractor without Norman's consent and Norman must accept performance. Thus, (A) and (B) are wrong. (D) is a misstatement of law; Zelda need not supervise.

\section{Answer to Question 77}

(B) The delegator remains personally liable for performance of the agreement even though the delegatee is performing the contract. Hence, (A) is incorrect. (C) is incorrect because although Norman and Kurt are not in privity of contract, Norman is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between Kurt and Zelda. When there is a delegation of duties, both the delegator and the delegatee are liable for performance of the agreement. (D) is wrong because if the services to be performed are not personal, the obligee has no choice but to accept performance, and it would be unfair that if by accepting performance, the obligee waives his rights as against the delegator.

\section{Answer to Question 78}

(B) The plat is only intended to be a representation of the actual survey as made upon the land itself. The plat is in the nature of a certified copy of an instrument that will be controlled by the original. Where a survey as made and marked upon the ground conflicts with the plat, the survey prevails. Thus, Andrew had a right to rely on the surveyor's stakes as establishing the boundaries of Lot 20. Thus, (B) is correct, and (C) is incorrect. (A) is incorrect because priority in purchase would not entitle Andrew to take land that was not part of Lot 20. (D) is incorrect because, while it is true that the adverse possession period has not run, Andrew need not rely on adverse possession to prevail.

\section{Answer to Question 79}

(C) The record on appeal must show that a specific objection was made and that the challenged evidence was inadmissible on that ground, before the trial court's action can be considered error. (A) is wrong because the defense counsel's objection did not state specific grounds for the objection; counsel merely said, "objection." (B) is wrong; the court is never required to state the reason for overruling an objection. (D) makes no sense at all. The objection was overruled and the evidence was received. "Offers of proof" are sometimes made when evidence is held inadmissible.

\section{Answer to Question 80}

(C) Battery is a general intent crime that can be established with a mental state of recklessness. In addition, all crimes require a voluntary act on the part of the actor. The epileptic seizure would negate both the voluntary act and the culpable mental state. In (A), the defendant would probably be guilty of battery. Intoxication is not a defense to a general intent crime, and the defendant's behavior would probably be classified as reckless. In (B), the defendant might be found guilty of battery. If Davis reasonably believed he was under attack, he would be justified in punching Verne; it would be a jury question as to whether his belief was reasonable. While under the facts of (B) it is possible that Davis would be not guilty, it is not as good an answer as (C), where it is clear there would be no criminal liability. In (D), the defendant would be guilty of battery. The facts do not justify a self-defense claim.

\section{Answer to Question 81}

(C) An attempt requires both a specific intent to commit the crime and an overt act in furtherance of that intent. Since Dag intended to enter Vance's property and was apprehended just before doing so, both requirements for attempt can be established. (A) is incorrect because Dag is not being charged with the attempt to commit violence, but with the attempt to enter onto the property. (B) is also wrong because clearly it is Dag's actions that are prohibited and not just the state of his mind. (D) is a poor answer because Dag cannot be convicted unless it is proved that he committed the offense with which he has been charged, and this answer does not require that the elements of the crime be proved.

\section{Answer to Question 82}

(A) As a direct tax upon the federal government, the sales tax is invalid unless Congress has consented to such a tax. (B) is wrong because the tax is on all autos purchased in the state, regardless of their source, and thus, there is no burden on interstate commerce. (C) is wrong because direct state taxation of the federal government is invalid whether or not discriminatory, absent the consent of Congress. (D) is wrong because, as stated, unless Congress consents, a direct tax on the federal government is invalid. Thus, the fact that there is a rational basis and that the tax is not a penalty does not matter: the question is one of the power to tax, not whether the tax itself is appropriate.

\section{Answer to Question 83}

(A) In a partial condemnation case, the landlord-tenant relationship continues, as does the tenant's obligation to pay the entire rent for the remaining lease term. (B) is wrong because, while the tenant generally is obligated to return the premises in the same condition as when received, that obligation would not be considered breached by the actions of a third party such as the government. (C) is wrong because the covenant of quiet enjoyment can be breached only by actions of the landlord and not those of a third party, such as the government. (D) is wrong because the law of landlord and tenant traditionally refuses to recognize frustration of purpose as grounds for termination of a lease.

\section{Answer to Question 84}

(D) Tyrone and Dennison are joint tortfeasors who are each jointly and severally liable for Pryor's injuries. As such, either may be sued for the entire amount of damages suffered. (C) is therefore incorrect. However, if Dennison is found to be liable to Pryor, he may seek contribution from Tyrone to force Tyrone to pay a portion of the recovery. He would have no right to indemnity because he is actively negligent in causing Pryor's injuries. (B) is therefore incorrect. (A) is incorrect because Dennison was a substantial factor in causing Pryor's injuries.

\section{Answer to Question 85}

(A) The Constitution prohibits the impairment of contractual obligations by a state except in certain narrow circumstances. The sort of "emergency" normally required for such state action is arguably present here, given the loss in tax revenues. But it is unlikely that the state would prevail since the termination of annual cost-of-living adjustments is permanent, and appears to be the sort of self-interest driven choice to reduce the state's contractual burdens that the Court has found suspect in comparable cases. (B) is wrong because federal courts do not have the jurisdiction to decide questions regarding an individual state's own constitution. (C) is wrong because the Eleventh Amendment does not bar suits against state officials unless retroactive relief is sought. (D) is wrong because although a state may amend its own statutes, it cannot do so in such a manner as to violate constitutional prohibitions.

\section{Answer to Question 86}

(C) The general rule is that a court will not enforce a contract if its subject matter or consideration is illegal; the court will leave the parties as it finds them. Here, the subject matter of the contract, placing gambling bets, is illegal in the state. Thus, (A) is wrong because Steve's performance is irrelevant. (B) is wrong because the court will refuse to help either party to an illegal contract, even where the other party has gained unfairly. (D) is wrong because the court will not put the parties back into the position they were in prior to entering into the contract, but rather will leave them where they stand.

\section{Answer to Question 87}

(A) When Doris took the coat, knowing it was not her own, she committed a trespassory taking. However, she was not then guilty of larceny because she did not have an intent to "steal" the coat (i.e., to permanently deprive the owner of the coat). However, under the continuing trespass doctrine, her possession continued to be trespassory, and when she later formed the intent to steal, her actions became larceny. Therefore, (D) is incorrect. Doris is not guilty of common law burglary. Her entry was effected shortly after lunchtime; i.e., during the day, and burglary requires a nighttime entry. Also, Doris did not intend to commit a felony when she entered the house, since she believed the coat was her own. Thus, (B) and (C) are also incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 88}

(C) Paula was a trespasser in Otto's cabin because she entered the cabin without permission or privilege. A landowner generally owes no duty to an undiscovered trespasser. However, if a landowner discovers or should anticipate the presence of a trespasser, he must exercise ordinary care to warn the trespasser of or to make safe concealed, unsafe, artificial conditions known to the landowner that involve a risk of death or serious bodily harm. Here, it is true that Otto owed no duty to Paula. However, had he known of or had reason to anticipate the presence of someone in the cabin, he would have owed a duty to warn of or to make safe the fireplace. Thus, (C) is a better answer than (D). (A) is wrong because Otto's knowledge of the defect is important only if he owed a duty to Paula, which he did not. (B) is wrong because, as stated, he had no duty to warn Paula because he did not know of her presence.

\section{Answer to Question 89}

(D) The reasonableness of Patty's apprehension of immediate harmful or offensive contact is determined by the reasonable person standard. Thus, although it may be a close question here because of Darryl's appearance and the authentic appearance of the gun, the fact that four other homeowners had not been frightened by Darryl's routine indicates that a reasonable person would have recognized that this was just a youngster engaging in traditional Halloween activity. Since all of the other choices are clearly wrong, (D) is the best option. (B) is wrong because if Patty's apprehension of immediate harm was unreasonable, there is no cause of action for assault. Furthermore, Darryl did not have the requisite intent for assault. While he may have intended to momentarily startle the person answering the door, he did not intend to cause apprehension of immediate harmful or offensive contact. (A) is wrong because there is no cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress; dressing up as a bandit and carrying a toy gun while trick or treating is not extreme and outrageous conduct so as to transcend all bounds of decency. (C) is wrong because minors may be liable for their intentional torts.

\section{Answer to Question 90}

(C) Grant's interest would be void under the Rule Against Perpetuities since his interest could (and most likely would) vest more than 21 years after a life in being. Hence, the instrument would be read as if the executory interest to Grant did not exist. Clara's interest is a fee simple determinable; thus, the grantor, Dawn, retains a possibility of reverter. (A) is therefore incorrect. (B) is incorrect because a possibility of reverter rather than a reversion arises upon a conveyance of a fee simple determinable. (D) is incorrect because the estate created was a fee simple determinable, not a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. Moreover, rights of entry must be expressly raised in the conveyance.

\section{Answer to Question 91}

(B) Since Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce is plenary, Congress has the right to prohibit completely the transportation of "harmful" substances in the channels of commerce. Congress could also otherwise regulate the manufacture and use of harmful drugs as part of its regulation of commerce. (A) is wrong because this Act has nothing to do with Congress's right to expend federal tax revenues, and the general welfare power has to do with Congress's spending power. (C) is incorrect because the constitutional right of privacy does not include the right to ingest harmful drugs. (D) is incorrect because this Act is a restriction on property use that is considered harmful to the public health and welfare; consequently, it is considered regulation and not a taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, and no compensation would be required.

\section{Answer to Question 92}

(B) A tax, even though enacted for a regulatory rather than a revenue-raising purpose, can be upheld as a "necessary and proper" exercise of Congress's power to tax under Article I, Section 8 , Clause 1. This will be especially true if the revenues derived from the measure are used to cover the expenses associated with the federal regulatory scheme. Since the question does not involve the attempted exercise of a state's sovereignty, there is no issue of the Supremacy Clause, and (A) is wrong. (C) is incorrect because Congress has broad power to regulate commerce, and the sale of the drug could probably be said to have a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce even if it was not actually being sold in interstate commerce. (D) is wrong because the states do not have the exclusive right to tax within their boundaries.

\section{Answer to Question 93}

(A) Leading questions are allowed on the direct examination of a "hostile" witness. There is no rule that allows leading questions on the direct examination of a "disinterested" witness. A leading question is normally permitted on cross-examination whether the witness is a lay person or an expert. (C) is, therefore, wrong. (B) is wrong because leading questions may be asked of very young or very old witnesses at the discretion of the court. (D) is wrong because a leading question may be asked of any witness on preliminary matters not in dispute. 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

\section{Answer to Question 94}

(C) Margo assigned part of her claim against Oscar to Percy, and, as a general rule, the assignee is subject to the same defenses that the obligor has against the assignor. If Margo, the assignor, had not done the work properly, Oscar would have a defense against her, hence he can use this defense against Percy. (A) is immaterial, because this is not a third-party beneficiary agreement, but an assignment of the right to receive money. Thus, $(\mathrm{B})$ must also be ruled out. (D) is wrong because an assignment of a future claim is not inoperable.

\section{Answer to Question 95}

(C) The only value his tickets will have to anyone is if they are used for admission to the All-Star game. Consequently, since Dennis did not intend to return the tickets to Tom until after the game, Dennis intended to permanently deprive Tom of the value of the tickets and most likely would be found guilty of larceny. (A) is not a correct answer because, although the intent to return the tickets may be a valid defense in some situations, in this situation Tom would have been permanently deprived of their value when they were returned, and therefore Dennis's intention would not be a valid defense. (B) is a tempting answer, but it is not the most likely. There are no facts that indicate the relative value of the tickets to the money that Dennis claims Tom owes him. (D) is not the most likely answer, because the intent to return may be a valid defense in some instances.

\section{Answer to Question 96}

(D) Attempted murder is a specific intent crime. Although it is true that a defendant can be found guilty of murder when his actions demonstrate a very high degree of recklessness, if the charge is attempted murder, it must be shown that the defendant committed an act with the intention of killing someone. If the jury believed that Seth had no intention of killing either Larsen or Carver, he cannot be convicted of attempted murder of either. Thus, (D) is correct, and (A), (B), and (C) are wrong.

\section{Answer to Question 97}

(D) Although the language in Maude's will uses the word "jointly," the grant also states "as tenants in common." Since no right of survivorship is mentioned, the court will most likely find that this language establishes a tenancy in common, rather than a joint tenancy. Lisa can pass her interest in the property by will, and thus Estelle now holds the property as a tenant in common with Louis. (A) is wrong; Louis's management of the use of the farm does not entitle him to an exclusive interest in it. (B) is wrong because the interest created by Maude's will was a tenancy in common, not a joint tenancy. (C) is wrong because the unities only apply to a joint tenancy.

\section{Answer to Question 98}

(C) Louis had the right to possess and enjoy the whole of the farm subject to the equal right of Lisa to do the same. The fact that Lisa chose not to exercise her right does not make Louis's possession wrongful. Therefore, an accounting is not warranted here. (A) is wrong because, as stated, Louis may enjoy the whole of the property. (B) is wrong; there is nothing in the facts to indicate an ouster. (D) is wrong because Louis cannot take by adverse possession unless there has been an ouster; his possession was not hostile to Lisa's interest. 

\section{Answer to Question 99}

(A) This is a question requiring precise knowledge of the U.C.C. The problem is governed by U.C.C. sections 2-615 and 2-616. A crop failure resulting from an unexpected cause excuses a farmer's obligation to deliver the full amount as long as he makes a fair and reasonable allocation among his buyers. George has done this by allocating pro rata between Walter and Vinnie. Nevertheless, under U.C.C. section 2-616 the buyer may either accept the proposed modification or terminate the contract. Thus, (B) is wrong. (C) is wrong because even though alternative sources are available, George is not obligated to use them because the contract was tied to a designated parcel of land-"my [George's] ranch." (D) is wrong because it is contrary to the provision of U.C.C. section 2-615, which permits the farmer to make an allocation.

\section{Answer to Question 100}

(D) Parents are not vicariously liable at common law for the intentional torts of their children (although many states have imposed limited liability for certain conduct by statute). However, a parent (or anyone else having care or custody of a child) can be held liable for injuries caused by the child where the parent herself was negligent. For example, the parent may be liable for failing to exercise reasonable care to protect against the child's known dangerous tendencies. Here, pursuant to statute, Sister Mary stood in loco parentis to Dieter. Thus, Sister Mary could be held liable if she knew that Dieter had dangerous propensities, and failed to take appropriate measures (e.g., keeping a closer watch on Dieter). Sister Mary then would be liable for her own negligence, not vicariously liable for Dieter's intentional tort. (D) is the only alternative that mentions the important factor of Sister Mary's knowledge regarding Dieter's dangerous propensities. (A) is incorrect because it ignores the fact that Sister Mary's liability depends upon her knowledge of any dangerous propensities on the part of Dieter. (B) is incorrect because neither raising children generally nor operating a home for developmentally disabled children are abnormally dangerous activities giving rise to strict liability. (C) is incorrect because it assumes that Sister Mary's liability, if any, will be based on vicarious liability.

\section{Answer to Question 101}

(D) Clearly this statute burdens interstate commerce by diverting purchases which would otherwise be made from interstate businesses to intrastate suppliers and by imposing a tax on interstate suppliers. Both requirements have the purpose and effect of imposing a direct burden on interstate commerce and, especially in the case of the tax, do so in a facially discriminatory manner. As such, they would be subjected to strict scrutiny, and would fail. (D) is therefore the best answer. (A) is incorrect because the measures involve economic and social matters and would, under the usual due process analysis, be subjected to rational basis scrutiny, which they would survive. (B) is wrong because there is a rational basis for the classification and no suspect classification or fundamental right is involved. (C) is wrong because, while a corporation as a legal entity may be considered a person for some purposes, corporations are not citizens for the purposes of the Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause.

\section{Answer to Question 102}

(C) Daniel's statement is an admission-an out-of-court statement by a party being offered into evidence by an opposing party. [Fed. R. Evid. $801(\mathrm{~d})(2)$ ] Since it is not considered hearsay evidence and is obviously relevant to the underlying question of who committed the battery against Paul, it would be admissible. (A) is incorrect because the "statement against interest" exception to the hearsay rule provides that a declarant's out-of-court statement is admissible if it is against the declarant's interest when made. [Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3)] Daniel's out-of-court statement ("I haven't been out of the country in five years") was not clearly against his interest when it was made. It is vastly different, for example, than if Daniel had confided to Walter that he had beaten Paul; that would be a statement against interest at the time the statement was made. That Daniel's actual statement to Walter was ultimately used against Daniel does not qualify it as a statement against interest. Also, and equally important, (A) is incorrect because the "statement against interest" exception to the hearsay rule comes into play only if the declarant is unavailable to testify (e.g., because the declarant is dead or cannot be found). [Fed. R. Evid. 804(a)] The question makes clear that Daniel not only is available to testify, but he actually does testify. Hence, the "unavailability" requirement of the "statement against interest" exception has not been satisfied. (B) is a plausible answer, but not as good as (C) because it contains several ambiguities. The answer is ambiguous as to the purpose for which Daniel's prior inconsistent statement is offered into evidence. If offered for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted in the statement, it would be inadmissible hearsay evidence; it would not meet the specific requirements of Rule $801(\mathrm{~d})(1)(\mathrm{A})$ to qualify as nonhearsay evidence: Daniel's prior inconsistent statement was not made under oath at another proceeding. If offered for the purpose of impeaching Daniel's testimony, however, the prior inconsistent statement might be admissible. Proving the prior inconsistent statement of a witness is a well-accepted method for impeaching the testimony of that witness. In this case, though, extrinsic evidence (the testimony of another witness, Walter) is being offered to prove Daniel's prior inconsistent statement. Extrinsic evidence can be used to show a prior inconsistent statement of a witness, for purposes of impeachment, only if the inconsistency goes to a material issue in the case. It would, at best, be a judgment call as to whether Daniel's not having left the country in five years is a material issue in Paul's suit against Daniel for battery. Thus, (C) is a better answer than (B). (D) is incorrect because, since Daniel's statement is an admission, its admissibility is not dependent on Daniel's having the opportunity to comment on it. Moreover, even if Daniel's statement were analyzed solely from the standpoint of being a prior inconsistent statement offered to impeach, (D) would be incorrect. The Federal Rules have abolished the common law requirement that a witness be given an opportunity to explain a prior inconsistent statement before extrinsic evidence of the statement can be admitted; the opportunity may be provided after introduction of the statement.

\section{Answer to Question 103}

(D) (A) is not the most likely answer, because the facts indicate that Defendant believed himself to be in danger. Even if it is found that his belief was unreasonable, at most he would be guilty of voluntary manslaughter. (B) is not the most likely answer either, because there is no showing that Defendant intended to kill anyone, or that when he fired the pistol it was likely that he would kill anyone. The fact that the bullet which killed $\mathrm{Al}$ ricocheted appears to make this killing a result of, at most, gross negligence. Thus, under this fact situation, Defendant most likely would be guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The facts in (C) do not indicate that Defendant would be charged with a crime at all since he did not intend to shoot at George and had no real reason to believe that George would be endangered by his conduct. At most, Defendant could be charged with negligent homicide if he were charged with a crime at all. In (D), Defendant would probably be charged with murder because, although it is arguable that the death of the customer was "accidental," it occurred during the commission of a dangerous felony, and under common law, would be subject to the felony murder rule.

\section{Answer to Question 104}

(B) But for Drago's negligent act of colliding with Pitts's car, Pitts would not have been injured. Drago is thus a cause in fact of Pitts's injuries. (A) is incorrect because Stratton's negligence would not qualify as an intervening act since it occurred earlier in time than Drago's. (C) is incorrect because the failure of the latch is not the type of intervening force that would relieve Drago from liability. (D) is incorrect because the "but for" test is used to establish liability in concurrent cause cases, not limit another's liability.

\section{Answer to Question 105}

(B) Pitts's claim against Stratton would be based on strict liability in tort. As such, she would only need to establish that the car was dangerously defective in order to recover. (A) is incorrect because Pitts's failure to discover the defect would be, at best, contributory negligence, which is not a defense to strict liability in tort in jurisdictions retaining traditional contributory negligence rules. (C) is incorrect because Drago's negligence would qualify as a foreseeable intervening force which would not relieve Stratton from liability. (D) is incorrect because Stratton is strictly liable even if it did not know or have reason to know of the defect.

\section{Answer to Question 106}

(C) Standing requires an allegation of such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues. Abstract injury is not enough; the plaintiff must show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of the challenged official conduct. The injury or threat of injury must be real and immediate, not conjectural or hypothetical. Here, the potential plaintiffs in (A) and $(B)$ are merely thinking about selling or buying used cars in State $B$. Thus, any injury or threat of injury to them is strictly hypothetical and abstract. Consequently, the potential plaintiffs in (A) and (B) are unlikely to have standing. Likewise, the out-of-state manufacturer in (D), who might be required to indemnify its dealers in State $\mathrm{B}$, is at this point able to assert merely a hypothetical injury, not one that is real and immediate. On the other hand, the potential plaintiff in (C), who already has a contract to sell used cars to a State B dealer, is immediately in danger of sustaining a direct economic injury as a result of the statute-i.e., costs associated with testing each car and bringing up to standard those cars found to be deficient.

\section{Answer to Question 107}

(D) A private nuisance action requires a showing that defendant's interference with the use and enjoyment of plaintiff's property was unreasonable. To be characterized as unreasonable, the severity of the inflicted injury must outweigh the utility of defendant's conduct. Here, the fact that the pesticide is the only means of preventing destruction of the state's principal agricultural product would be the most persuasive additional fact for Growit's defense. (A) is incorrect because coming to the nuisance is generally not a good defense to a nuisance action. (B) and (C) are incorrect even though they state factors which may be considered by a court in determining whether an injunction should be issued. The main question is whether the severity of the injury outweighs the utility of defendant's conduct, and these two factors do not speak as well to this point as (D).

\section{Answer to Question 108}

(C) Walter's testimony of three instances of reckless driving by Doug would be considered character evidence. Character evidence is not admissible in a civil case if offered to show that a party probably acted in conformity with that character. Character evidence is admissible in a civil case when the character of a person is an issue in the case. Peter is suing Olivia on a negligent entrustment theory, and thus Doug's character as a safe driver is in issue in the case against Olivia, but 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

not in the case against Doug himself. (A) is wrong; as stated, Doug's character is in issue in determining whether Olivia was negligent. (B) is wrong because specific instances of conduct may be used to prove character when character is an issue in the case. [Fed. R. Evid. 405(B)] (D) is wrong because this is not a criminal case.

\section{Answer to Question 109}

(D) Peter's objection should be overruled. Harry's testimony is a classic example of evidence regarding habit, and Olivia's habit is relevant to the issue of negligent entrustment. (A) is wrong because neither the Federal Rules nor the prevailing common law requires the corroboration of habit evidence. (B) and (C) are wrong because the testimony is evidence of habit, not character.

\section{Answer to Question 110}

(B) Prevention of performance by an irresistible, superhuman cause is an excuse for nonperformance of a contract, unless the parties stipulate to the contrary. The destruction of the lot by the forces of nature rendered performance impossible, so Builder need not perform. (A) is wrong because destruction of the property does not make the contract void; it merely discharges Builder. (C) is a misstatement of law. (D) is wrong because there was no mutual mistake.

\section{Answer to Question 111}

(D) The general rule is that a contractor is responsible for destruction of the premises under construction prior to completion. Once the residence is completed, risk of loss shifts to the owner. Builder must perform the original contract without compensation for the work that was destroyed by the storm. Thus, (D) is correct and (C) is wrong. (A) is wrong because the subject matter was not destroyed; and even if it were, the contract would not be void. (B) is wrong because performance is not impossible; he can rebuild the residence.

\section{Answer to Question 112}

(C) Modern courts recognize that impracticability due to excessive and unreasonable difficulty or expense is a defense to breach of contract for nonperformance. Since the cost to Builder to perform under the original contract would exceed more than double what he would be paid, under the modern view, he would be excused from performance by commercial impracticability. Unlike destruction of the building itself before completion, which will not discharge a contractor's duty, the erosion of the lot, which destroys the means of performing the contract, will generally not be one of the risks that a contractor will be deemed to have assumed. Thus, (D) is wrong. (A) is wrong because Builder's bankruptcy is irrelevant for this purpose. (B) is wrong because there is no mutual mistake here.

\section{Answer to Question 113}

(C) Performance is excused where prevented by operation of law, despite any stipulation to the contrary. Because governmental interference made performance of the contract as contemplated illegal, Builder is excused from performance, even though some performance is possible. Thus, (C) is correct, and (D) is incorrect. (A) is incorrect because there was no mutual mistake when the contract was formed. (B) is wrong because Owner did not breach the contract.

\section{Answer to Question 114}

(C) On the happening of the prohibited event (using Blackacre for other than residential purposes), Brian's fee simple determinable automatically came to an end, and Owner was entitled to present possession. Not having claimed possession within the applicable seven-year period, and with Brian's possession being open, notorious, continuous, and adverse, any action by Owner or his heirs is now barred by adverse possession. Thus, (A) and (B) are incorrect. (D) is incorrect because a possibility of reverter becomes possessory automatically upon termination of the prior determinable estate. Unlike a right of entry, a grantor does not have to assert a possibility of reverter in order for a cause of action to arise.

\section{Answer to Question 115}

(B) Under the facts of this case, to support a finding of murder, the trial court would have to find that Bob acted either intentionally or with malice aforethought. The facts clearly indicate that Bob did not know of the car, so it cannot be said that he shot at it intentionally, and therefore (A) is not correct. "Malice aforethought" has several definitions, one of which is that the defendant is acting in a "wanton" state of mind. There is little question that shooting a rifle through a front door can be considered "wanton." Thus, the question is whether Bob's intoxication was sufficient to negate this state of mind. If a defendant's lack of awareness results from voluntary intoxication, his conduct will nevertheless be deemed wanton. (C) is not a correct analysis of the issue, because his intentional act was firing the rifle, not shooting at the car. (D) is not the best answer, because although there is the possibility that Bob might have been able to show only gross negligence, there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of malice aforethought and murder.

\section{Answer to Question 116}

(B) This situation presents a possible violation of the Equal Protection Clause. A state may not favor established residents over new residents. To do so in an area that affects a person's ability to engage in his livelihood impedes migration from state to state. Interstate travel is a fundamental right, and a classification that burdens it would trigger a strict scrutiny analysis. In any case, the classification would be subjected to something more than the mere rationality test. (A) is incorrect because this is not an area reserved to the states, and even if it were, the United States Constitution would take precedence over state law. (C) is wrong because the Fifth Amendment applies only to federal, not state, government action. (D) is wrong because the Privileges and Immunities Clause does not apply to aliens.

\section{Answer to Question 117}

(C) The statutes violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, which prohibits discrimination against nonresidents with respect to essential activities (e.g., pursuing a livelihood) unless (i) the discrimination is closely related to a substantial state purpose, and (ii) less restrictive means are not available. Here, other controls could be placed on fishing without discriminating against out-of-state fishermen. (A) is wrong because, even though Congress has not acted in this area, the statutes would still be unconstitutional in light of the negative implications of the "dormant" Commerce Clause. Congressional silence is, therefore, irrelevant. (B) states a due process test which, even if applicable, would not preclude a finding of unconstitutionality on other grounds. (D) is wrong because the activity here does not involve foreign commerce-this is a dispute between one state and a citizen of another state.

\section{Answer to Question 118}

(A) The grant is valid because Oliver Jr. was a life in being when the interest was created. (B) is incorrect because a reversionary interest is an interest remaining in the grantor. (D) is incorrect because a possibility of reverter is the interest left in the grantor after a conveyance of a fee simple determinable. Here, Oliver Sr. did not create such an estate. (C) is obviously incorrect, since the language of the deed clearly shows that Oliver Sr. was not giving Melinda the complete interest in this property; she received a fee simple subject to divestment by Oliver Jr.'s executory interest.

\section{Answer to Question 119}

(D) In a criminal case, other crimes and wrongs of the defendant may be admissible even though they are not charged, but they are not automatically admissible. There are two basic ideas: other crimes or wrongs are not admissible to show that the defendant is a bad person, nor are they admissible to show the defendant is a person of the type likely to commit this crime. Other crimes or wrongs may be admissible if they are relevant to show proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, unless the judge determines that the probative value is substantially outweighed by prejudice. (A) and (B) are therefore wrong. (C) is wrong because extrinsic evidence of specific crimes is not admissible to rebut evidence of good character. While (D) calls for a judgment on the part of the trial judge and could be debated, it is the best answer because (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect statements of the law.

\section{Answer to Question 120}

(C) (B) is wrong. Under Federal Rule 801, prior identification can be admissible. The description is in the nature of prior testimony or prior identification. To be admissible, however, the declarant must testify at the trial and be subject to cross-examination. Since the night watchman died, this requirement cannot be satisfied. On these facts, there are no exceptions to the hearsay rule that would make the description admissible. (A) is wrong because before a document can be admitted as a past recollection recorded, the person whose statement appears in the document must be on the witness stand. (D) would have no bearing on the admissibility of the description.

\section{Answer to Question 121}

(B) Since the question involves a crime of dishonesty, and the conviction is less than 10 years old, the question is proper on cross-examination because it goes to Fred's credibility. Evidence is not admissible to show general bad character or propensity to commit crimes; (A) is therefore wrong. (C) is wrong because this crime has plenty of probative value on the issue of credibility and because most courts hold that impeachment with a crime requiring proof or admission of an act of dishonesty or false statement cannot be excluded as too prejudicial. (D) is wrong because similarity to the crime charged is not required by the federal rules.

\section{Answer to Question 122}

(D) The prosecutor is required by the Due Process Clause to prove each and every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. One of the elements of larceny is an intent to permanently deprive a victim of his or her property, and the instructions in this case put the burden of proof on Dennis to show that there was no such intent. This relieves the prosecution of its burden because it implies that there is a presumption that Dennis intended to permanently deprive her of her jewels. (A) is wrong. The jury does have the power to ignore Dennis's testimony, but the conviction will be reversed because of the unconstitutional instruction on burden of proof. (B) is wrong. Dennis is not required to rebut the state's evidence; the state must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt. (C) is not the best answer. While it is true that in some jurisdictions the judge cannot comment on the evidence in a criminal case, that prohibition would not be violated by an appropriate instruction on burden of proof.

\section{Answer to Question 123}

(A) This question raises the issue of whether an employee's out-of-court statement ("The accident was my fault; I wasn't paying any attention") will be attributed to the employer, and thus considered an admission when the employer is a party. The answer is yes, provided the statement was made while the person was employed by the employer (not before or after the period of employment) and provided the statement related to the employment. [Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D)] (A) is correct. Wilber's statement was made while he was employed by Ace Meat Packing Co., and it related to his employment in that it pertained to an accident that occurred when he was driving an Ace truck, presumably in the course of employment. Conversely, (C) is incorrect. That Wilber is no longer employed by Ace does not bear on the admissibility of his statement; what counts is that he was employed by Ace at the time he made the statement. (D) is also incorrect. That Ace may not have authorized Wilber to make the statement does not preclude it from being admissible; what counts is that the statement was made by an employee and related to his employment. Although one basis for attributing an employee's statement to the employer is the employer's authorization for the employee to speak on its behalf [Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(C)], that is not the only basis for treating the employee's statement in such a manner. (B) is incorrect because there is little reason to conclude that Wilber's statement was an "excited utterance" within the meaning of that hearsay exception. [Fed. R. Evid. 803(2)] The question does not indicate that Wilber spoke in an excited manner. The words in the statement itself do not suggest that the statement was made while Wilber was agitated. That Wilber spoke shortly after the accident would not alone be sufficient to make his statement an "excited utterance."

\section{Answer to Question 124}

(A) Barry had exclusive, continuous possession of the three-foot strip for the requisite statutory period. This possession was open and notorious; i.e., it was possession as an owner would make of the land, and it put the true owner and the community on notice of the fact of possession. This possession was also hostile and under claim of right. Under the majority view, Barry's mistake as to the ownership of the three-foot strip is not determinative. Barry has held under claim of right because his actions appear to the community to be a claim of ownership and he is not holding with permission of the owner. Thus, (D) is incorrect. (C) is incorrect because the open and notorious nature of Barry's possession was sufficient to put the true owner on notice that a possession adverse to the owner's title had been taken. (B) is simply an incorrect statement of the law; there is no such presumption.

\section{Answer to Question 125}

(A) The facts state that Carter swung the hammer at John "intending to frighten" him. Thus, Carter did an act with the intent of causing the apprehension of immediate harmful or offensive contact, i.e., an "assault." Because John was actually hit by the hammer head, the trial court would utilize the transferred intent doctrine to supply the necessary intent for battery. It makes no difference that Carter may not have known that the hammer was defective, because he set in motion the force that injured John; hence, (C) is an improper answer. (B) and (D) are not correct answers because they both go to the issue of a defense, and a person is not privileged to use deadly force against another no matter how provoking the other's mere statements may have been. Clearly, being hit with a hammer would be considered deadly force. 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

\section{Answer to Question 126}

(D) The Daily Bleat's best defense is that Dr. Wally is dead. Only living persons can be defamed; defamation of a deceased person is not an actionable tort. Thus, because Dr. Wally is dead, The Daily Bleat can obtain dismissal of the defamation action without having to establish any defamation defenses. Therefore, (D) is correct. (A) is not as good a defense as (D) because, in order to use the defense of absence of malice, the newspaper would have to establish that Dr. Wally was a public figure, which would be more difficult than showing that the doctor is dead. Moreover, it is not conclusive from the facts that Dr. Wally is a public figure as defined by the Gertz case (someone of pervasive fame or who is involved in a particular public controversy), since the facts merely state that he was prominent in the community. (B) is incorrect because a retraction, while it may show lack of actual malice in mitigation of damages, would not necessarily eliminate all of the harm to Dr. Wally's reputation. The fact that the retraction ran the next day on the front page gives the newspaper a better case, but it is not as good a defense as the fact that Wally is dead. (C) is incorrect because the fact that Snoops got his information from a secretary at the Medical School does not preclude liability for defamation. At most, that fact may be asserted to disprove malice if Dr. Wally was a public figure or negligence if the doctor's death was a matter of public concern. However, even assuming that one of these standards applies, Snoops may still be at fault for not having obtained a more authoritative statement from someone at the Medical School.

\section{Answer to Question 127}

(A) Zelda did not promise to do anything she was not otherwise obligated to do in bargained-for exchange for Christine's promise, so no consideration supported the latter's promise. If the agreement were otherwise enforceable, none of the other facts offered by the answers would prevent it from being carried out. (B) is incorrect because a court will not examine the promisor's subjective intent when making a promise. (C) is incorrect because mistake as to a fact that motivated the contract is not a defense under these circumstances; Christine had assumed the risk of mistake by making the promise without being certain of the cause of the accident. (D) is similarly incorrect. Mistake as to the value of the promise is generally a risk assumed by the parties.

\section{Answer to Question 128}

(A) Christine offered to pay Dr. Winston if Dr. Winston treated Zelda. Dr. Winston accepted by treating Zelda; this treatment was also her consideration for the contract. Thus, Christine was contractually bound to pay for the medical expenses and (A) is correct. (B) is incorrect because Christine's promise need not have been in writing to be enforceable. The requirement of a writing under the Statute of Frauds for promises to pay the debt of another is not applicable here. Christine's promise was not a suretyship promise that was collateral to a promise of Zelda's; it was an independent promise by Christine to be primarily liable for Zelda's medical expenses, and therefore need not be in writing to be enforceable. (C) is incorrect because Dr. Winston's treatment is the consideration for Christine's promise to pay. There is nothing in the facts to suggest that Dr. Winston had incurred a preexisting duty to treat Zelda until she recovered; even if Dr. Winston had already agreed to begin treating Zelda, Dr. Winston received Christine's letter and then proceeded to treat Zelda until she recovered, sending Christine the bill in reliance on her promise. Hence, a court will find sufficient consideration here to avoid a preexisting duty problem. (D) is incorrect because Dr. Winston's treatment was the benefit that Christine sought to derive from her bargain. Remember that the benefit need not have economic value. Christine's benefit here is her peace of mind. 

\section{Answer to Question 129}

(A) Since Sandy informed Ben that he could develop the eastern five acres of the land, and since he reasonably relied on her statement to his detriment, she probably will be estopped to deny its effect. (B) is incorrect. Where the language of the grant is clear and a joint tenancy is created, no presumption is needed or applies. The joint tenancy cannot later be changed by subsequent informal action. (C) is wrong because an oral agreement is not effective to terminate a joint tenancy. (D) is an incorrect statement of the law. A joint tenant may not pass an interest to anyone at death, due to the right of survivorship.

\section{Answer to Question 130}

(A) The Statute of Frauds prevents the enforcement of an oral agreement concerning an interest in land. (B) is wrong because there is no issue as to the record title to the land. The agreement between Ben and Sandy, if it had been reduced to writing, would have been perfectly valid as between them. (C) is wrong because a joint tenancy can be unilaterally severed. (D) is wrong because this would not support Sandy's ownership of the entire piece of land.

\section{Answer to Question 131}

(B) As a general matter, a state may regulate in ways that impact on interstate commerce as long as the regulation does so only indirectly and the benefits outweigh the burdens imposed by compliance with the regulation. [Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. (1981)] When, as here, only a bare assertion that the regulation would increase safety is involved, a court will generally find that the regulation is invalid. This does not mean that a state could not prevail if it proved that the benefits of the regulation do in fact outweigh the burdens. Indeed, the Court intimated that such would be the case in Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc. (1959). But Nevada has not made a sufficient showing here, and Western has presented colorable "expert" evidence to the contrary. (A) is incorrect because economic and social regulations are tested at the rational basis level for due process purposes, and even the minimal showing here would suffice for the state. (C) states a correct premise (i.e., that the state is regulating for highway safety), but an incorrect result, and is wrong. (D) is wrong because the state has in fact made no such showing before the court. Thus, while there is a normal presumption of constitutionality, the state here has not met its burden in defending the measure in the face of contrary, expert evidence.

\section{Answer to Question 132}

(D) A conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to accomplish an unlawful act or objective. The parties must intend to enter into the agreement and intend to achieve the objective of the agreement. Baxter and Dunn agreed to defraud the insurance company and had the requisite intent. They also committed an overt act in furtherance of that intent. Thus, they can be convicted of conspiracy. (A) is wrong because the crime is complete upon agreement with the requisite intent; the objective does not have to be accomplished. (B) is wrong because impossibility is not a defense to conspiracy. (C) is wrong. Taking the neighbor's property could make them guilty of some other crime, but it is not necessary to convict them of conspiracy.

\section{Answer to Question 133}

(D) Common law burglary is the breaking and entering of the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony or larceny inside the house. However, in addition to the specific intent to commit a felony (for which insurance fraud might qualify), the defendant also must have intended to break and enter the dwelling. If Dunn reasonably believed it was Baxter's home, he would not have the intent to break and enter, as he would believe he was invited to enter the house the way he did. (A) is wrong because mistake of law is not a defense. (B) is wrong; opening the window, even though it was ajar, would be considered a breaking under the better view. (C) is wrong; there clearly was an entry.

\section{Answer to Question 134}

(A) Clem's best theory is that Allan negligently failed to control the conduct of his guests. A landowner has a duty to exercise reasonable care with respect to his own activities on the land and to control the conduct of others on his property so as to avoid unreasonable risk of harm to those outside the property. It was reasonably foreseeable that a large skyrocket might malfunction and cause injury or damage to the person or property of someone outside Allan's land, especially to an adjoining landowner. By failing to prevent his guest from lighting the skyrocket, Allan breached his duty to control the conduct of persons on his property so as to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm to those outside the property. This breach actually and proximately caused the damage to Clem's garage. Therefore, Clem would prevail under the theory set forth in (A). Regarding (B), it is questionable whether the setting off of fireworks constitutes an ultrahazardous activity. However, even if this is deemed to be an ultrahazardous activity, simply failing to control Bob's activities will not render Allan strictly liable for harm that results. Allan would owe an absolute duty to make safe an ultrahazardous activity in which he was actually engaged (e.g., if Allan himself was setting off the fireworks or if he had organized the party with a purpose of having his guests shoot fireworks out of his backyard). However, Allan was not so engaged. At most, Allan failed to prevent someone else from shooting fireworks. For this, Allan can be held liable on a negligence basis, but not in strict liability. (C) is incorrect for two reasons. First, Clem's being invited to Allan's party does not make Clem an "invitee." A social guest is deemed to be a licensee, i.e., one who enters on land with the permission of the owner or possessor for his own purpose rather than for the benefit of the owner or possessor. Second, at the time of the damage to the garage, Clem was not even on the land of Allan. Thus, Clem is neither a licensee nor an invitee; Allan's duty toward him is one of ordinary care because he is an adjoining property owner. (D) is incorrect because Allan did not violate the ordinance. The precise standard of care in a common law negligence case may be established by proving the applicability to the case of a statute providing for a criminal penalty. Where the plaintiff is in the class intended to be protected by the statute and the statute was designed to prevent the type of harm suffered by the plaintiff, violation of the statute is negligence per se in most jurisdictions, i.e., plaintiff will have established a conclusive presumption of duty and breach of duty. The ordinance here at issue proscribes the sale of fireworks within the city. Allan did not engage in any transaction involving fireworks. Thus, Allan did not violate the ordinance, and negligence per se is inapplicable.

\section{Answer to Question 135}

(B) Bob probably will be able to avoid liability if he can establish that he aimed the skyrocket to avoid crashing into Clem's garage. The element of breach of duty in a negligence case requires a showing that the defendant acted unreasonably, which is a question for the trier of fact. Assuming that Bob owed a duty to avoid harm to Clem's garage, Bob will be able to argue that he did not breach that duty because he aimed the skyrocket to avoid crashing it into Clem's garage. If the facts support this argument, Bob probably will be able to avoid liability to Clem. (A) is incorrect because customary methods of conduct do not conclusively establish the standard for determining whether a defendant's conduct amounted to negligence. Although it may have been an "accepted custom" in the community to set off skyrockets on the Fourth of July, this custom may in fact present an unreasonable risk of injury to persons in the position of Clem. Thus, the argument in (A) does not enable Bob to avoid liability. (C) is incorrect because all of the direct consequences of a negligent act are viewed as proximately caused by that act. If it was reasonably foreseeable that firing the skyrocket would cause damage to Clem's garage, then Bob's conduct was negligent. If some damage to the garage from the skyrocket was foreseeable, Bob is liable for the total destruction that occurred, despite the fact that the garage would not have burned down if it were not built of highly flammable material (i.e., Bob must "take his plaintiff as he finds him"). (D) is incorrect because there really is no restricted scope of liability for Allan with respect to persons outside his property. A landowner has a duty to exercise reasonable care with respect to his own activities on the land so as to avoid unreasonable risk of harm to others outside the property. Thus, Allan would be liable to Clem if Allan had fired the skyrocket and thereby created an unreasonable risk of harm to Clem's garage, resulting in damage to the garage. Bob's status as a guest on Allan's property does not excuse Bob from the duty to refrain from creating an unreasonable risk of harm to the person or property of a foreseeable plaintiff, such as Clem. Therefore, (D) presents nothing that will enable Bob to avoid liability.

\section{Answer to Question 136}

(B) Other crimes and wrongs are generally not admissible to prove that a person acted in conformity with his bad character. They are sometimes admissible to establish the identity of the accused. Other crimes are admissible on identity when they are committed in a very unique way that shows what amounts to a "signature" of the perpetrator. Theoretically, even signature crimes can be excluded if the judge determines that the probative value is substantially outweighed by prejudice. However, a crime qualifying as a signature crime is highly probative and would rarely be excluded under that theory. Therefore (B) is the most likely result. (C) and (D) are not wrong but, given the highly unique weapon, they are not as likely as (B). (A) is wrong. One other crime could not establish habit.

\section{Answer to Question 137}

(C) Shelley would be acquitted if the jury found that she was reasonable in believing that the house was abandoned. Under the terms of the statute, the actor must "willfully shut off the gas ... to an inhabited dwelling." The requirement of an inhabited dwelling is a material element of the crime. A reasonable mistake about a material element will negate criminal liability for all crimes except strict liability offenses. This is not a strict liability offense since a mental state of willfulness is required. Thus, if Shelley reasonably believed that the house was abandoned, she made a reasonable mistake about whether it was an "inhabited dwelling," and she should be found not guilty. (A) is wrong because, as mentioned, this is not a strict liability offense; willfulness is required. (B) is not as good an answer as (C) because there is no specific amount of time that she must wait before reasonably concluding that the house has been abandoned. (B) assumes that the jury will find her actions unreasonable, but it is also possible that they will find her actions reasonable. (D) is wrong because if all the elements of the statute were present, Shelley would not be excused from criminal liability simply because the couple had been negligent in mailing the rent check.

\section{Answer to Question 138}

(C) If Sandra prevails, it will be because the court has applied the promissory estoppel exception to the Statute of Frauds. [See Restatement (Second) of Contracts $\S \S 129,139$ ] Because Sandra relied on Mildred's promise by moving in with her and caring for her, and because the monetary value of her services is difficult to determine, specific enforcement of Mildred's promise is necessary to avoid injustice. [See Restatement (Second) of Contracts $\S 129$, illus. 10] (D) is wrong because 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

Sandra's performance of the oral agreement is not such as could be explained only by the existence of an oral agreement to convey the brownstone. Mildred's daughter has done nothing but assert her legal rights, and a familial relationship does not obviate the Statute of Frauds. Thus, (A) and (B) are incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 139}

(B) An inter vivos conveyance by one joint tenant of his interest in the property severs the joint tenancy and changes it to a tenancy in common. (A) is wrong because, as discussed above, severance results in a tenancy in common. West and Brown could not hold as joint tenants because the unity of time is lacking. (C) is incorrect because a tenancy by the entirety can be created only in a husband and wife. Hines and West were not married until after the creation of the tenancy, and their marriage does not change the nature of their title to Blackacre. (D) is wrong because Hines's conveyance to Brown severed the joint tenancy.

\section{Answer to Question 140}

(C) The facts do not make out a claim for invasion of privacy in any of the four forms that invasion of privacy takes. The photograph was not an appropriation for commercial purposes because it was incidental to a legitimate news story and was not used in an advertisement. The photograph did not involve intrusion because it was taken in a public place. The news feature did not involve false light because the caption correctly identified Betty as Sonny's mother and the facts do not indicate anything else to suggest that the photograph conveyed a false impression. Finally, Betty's appearance at the police station simply was not a private fact, because it is generally agreed that anything visible in a public place may be recorded and given circulation by means of a photograph. (A) and (B) are therefore incorrect. (D) is incorrect because truth is not a defense to most invasion of privacy actions. Even for false light invasion of privacy, the fact that the caption was true does not preclude recovery if the photograph otherwise conveyed a false impression. Thus, (C) is a better choice than (D).

\section{Answer to Question 141}

(D) At common law, murder was the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought could be established with any one of the following states of mind: intent to kill; intent to cause serious bodily harm; the depraved heart killing (a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life); or the commission of a felony. It is unlikely the defendant in (A) would be found guilty of murder. The defendant's action does not indicate the depraved heart mental state. There clearly was no intent to kill, intent to cause bodily harm, or commission of a felony. In (B), the defendant's crime would most likely be classified as voluntary manslaughter in light of the provoking event and subsequent heat of passion. It is unlikely the defendant in (C) would be guilty of murder. While the defendant's action might be classified as negligent or even reckless, it would not represent a depraved heart-reckless indifference to life state of mind. (D) represents the fact pattern where the defendant is most likely guilty of murder. Firing a gun into a house would demonstrate a reckless indifference to a high risk to human life.

\section{Answer to Question 142}

(A) Since the state statute conflicts with the terms of the federal contract, the federal contract must take precedence, pursuant to the Supremacy Clause and principles of federal immunity from state regulation. $(\mathrm{B})$ is not a good answer because there are no facts indicating that the statute was enacted after the contract was formed; in fact, the problem implies that the reverse is true. (C) is not the best answer because, although it is possible that a state's regulation of the manufacture of goods might affect interstate commerce so as to invoke the commerce power, the facts of this problem do not indicate any likelihood of such a circumstance, and are insufficient to be conclusive anyway. Thus, (A) is the only correct answer.

\section{Answer to Question 143}

(A) Child will prevail because a jury easily could find that a reasonable person, knowing that children frequently played in Elm Street and observing a ball roll into the street, would take reasonable care to avoid the foreseeable risk of hitting a child darting into the street. (B) is wrong because reasonable care in the circumstances could require driving at less than the speed limit. (C) raises the possibility of a contributory negligence defense. A child, however, is usually held to the standard of a reasonable child of like age, intelligence, and maturity. The facts tell us nothing about Child's intelligence and maturity, but a jury is likely to find that most children four years of age are unlikely to watch out for traffic. (C) thus is wrong because Child probably would not be considered negligent under a child standard of care. (D) is wrong because the parents' potential negligence, even if it gave rise to a contribution claim by Driver against them, would not cut off Child's claim against Driver because Driver's negligence would remain both an actual and a proximate cause of the accident-even if parental negligence was also a cause. A parent's negligence ordinarily is not imputed to a child, and no other basis appears from the fact pattern for doing so.

\section{Answer to Question 144}

(D) Pedestrian had fallen and was in "helpless peril" when Driver's car struck him. If Driver had the "last clear chance" to avoid the accident, that would override any contributory negligence on Pedestrian's part. (A) is incorrect because "danger invites rescue," and it is foreseeable that an adult would rush out to aid a child in danger. (B) is incorrect because one may be negligent even if speed limits are observed. (C) is incorrect because relatives are not the only people who may be expected to be rescuers, even though Pedestrian did not have a duty to rescue Child.

\section{Answer to Question 145}

(C) Because Blueacre was held in joint tenancy, all of the interest in Blueacre could only be conveyed by both of the joint tenants. The forgery of Howard's signature on the deed is ineffective to convey his interest in the property. Thus, $(\mathrm{B})$ is incorrect. However, Wendy's signature on the deed will serve to convey her interest in Blueacre. (D) is therefore incorrect. This conveyance of Wendy's interest in the property terminates the joint tenancy, leaving Howard and Tim holding their interests as tenants in common. Thus, (A) is incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 146}

(D) Where no suspect or quasi-suspect classification or fundamental rights are involved, the equal protection analysis uses the rational basis test: if the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest, it is valid. Since there appears to be a rational basis for the challenged legislationprotecting the environment and the citizenry from the effects of potentially permanent artificial materials-the law is valid. (A) is incorrect because it assumes that the state must use the least restrictive alternative, but that is not required except when strict scrutiny is used. There is no basis for such review under the facts of this question because there is neither a suspect classification nor a fundamental right. $(\mathrm{B})$ is wrong for the same reason: under equal protection analysis, a "compelling purpose" is required only when strict scrutiny is used. Challenges to economic regulations are subjected only to a rational basis test. (C) is incorrect because whether Congress has entered the field is irrelevant to an equal protection analysis. The call of the question specifically asks for the determination of the equal protection challenge; federal preemption issues are irrelevant here.

\section{Answer to Question 147}

(D) The ranch will pass exactly as expressed by Fred in the deed. Since Diane died without children, George does not have a life estate. (A) is wrong because, absent applicability of the doctrine of destructibility of contingent remainders, merger occurs when a life estate and a vested remainder or reversion is held by the same person-not the case here because George has no life estate. Diane's interest is a life estate; thus, she has no interest to pass to George by intestate succession. (B) is therefore wrong. (C) is wrong because the Rule Against Perpetuities is not violated; the spouse's interest will vest, if at all, within a life in being plus 21 years, since Diane's spouse will be identifiable at her death.

\section{Answer to Question 148}

(C) George has a life estate, Ann has an absolutely vested remainder, and Curtis, by intestate succession, will inherit Bradley's absolutely vested remainder. The remainder to Diane's children was vested subject to open upon the birth of her first child. Since Diane cannot have any more children after her death, all members of the class are ascertained at that time and the remainder becomes indefeasibly vested. Since the grant was to Diane's "children" rather than "issue" or "descendants," there is no unborn spouse problem. (A) is wrong because Bradley's vested remainder is inheritable by Curtis. (B) is wrong because George has only a life estate-not a fee simple absolute-and Ann and Curtis have absolutely vested remainders. (D) is wrong because the class gift in the limitation "to the remainder in fee simple to Diane's children" closes upon Diane's death; no children thereafter can be born to her, which precludes the remainder's being "subject to open."

\section{Answer to Question 149}

(A) Absent consent or cession, a state retains jurisdiction over federal lands within its territory. However, Congress also retains the power to enact legislation respecting such lands, pursuant to the Property Clause. When Congress so acts, the federal legislation necessarily overrides conflicting state laws under the Supremacy Clause. Here, the laws of the state of West permit Nimrod to hunt in the state. However, under the Supremacy Clause, the federal statute overrides West's law with respect to matters involving the federal military base which is located in West. The power to raise and maintain an army and navy does not necessarily include the right to regulate certain property. Thus, (B) is wrong. The Commerce Clause could possibly be a proper basis for upholding the statute, but there is nothing in the facts indicating that Congress has exercised the commerce power in this manner. (A) is therefore a better answer. (D) is wrong because the Privileges and Immunities Clause applies to state action.

\section{Answer to Question 150}

(D) Although evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts is not admissible to prove character and conformity therewith, it may be admissible if it is relevant to some issue other than the defendant's character or disposition to commit the crime. Here, the testimony is relevant to counter Cheryl's assertion that she lacked knowledge. (A) is therefore incorrect. (B) is incorrect because the testimony tends to make the fact that Cheryl knew about the scheme more probably true than it would have been without the testimony. (C) is incorrect because Cheryl has neither taken the stand nor introduced evidence of her good character.

\section{Answer to Question 151}

(A) The prosecution cannot initiate evidence of the defendant's bad character. The prosecution may offer such evidence only after the accused has put her character in issue by either taking the stand (placing credibility in issue) or offering evidence of her good character. Thus, (C) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because, under the Federal Rules, character may be proven by opinion evidence. (D) is incorrect because this does not constitute a regular response to a specific set of circumstances; it is merely reputation and opinion evidence.

\section{Answer to Question 152}

(B) Within 90 days after installation is the most reasonable interpretation of the relevant contract language. The agreement is express, not constructive, on this point, and the normal situation would be that the parties expected payment to occur after installation, since a contrary interpretation would require a prediction as to when installation would be completed. Thus, (B) is correct, and (C) and (D) are incorrect. (A) is incorrect because it does not take into account the 90 days.

\section{Answer to Question 153}

(A) The memorandum does not cover the entire agreement between the parties and was thus not a complete integration. Since the writing contains no mention of the oral agreement to use existing food products, the testimony would not "interpret" it in any way. Thus, (B) is incorrect. (C) and (D) are wrong because there is no evidence that MacDougall Corporation detrimentally relied upon the oral agreement in signing the memorandum, or that TM's promise constituted a misrepresentation at the time it was made.

\section{Answer to Question 154}

(B) Generally, late performance of a contract is treated as a minor breach that gives the nonbreaching party a right to damages but does not relieve him of his duty to perform. Late performance will be considered to be material only if the nature of the contract requires timely performance (such as in "goods" contracts within the U.C.C.) or if the contract provides that time is of the essence. Nothing in the contract here states that time is of the essence, and the contract does not by its nature require timely performance (it is a "services" contract rather than a "goods" contract under the U.C.C.). (A) is incorrect because absence of a liquidated damage clause does not have a bearing on whether delay in performance is a material breach. (C) is incorrect because the completion date is stated in terms of a promise rather than as an express condition. (D) is an untrue statement; the doctrine applies to commercial contracts for services.

\section{Answer to Question 155}

(B) The parties may orally waive the contract provision limiting amendment to a writing; thus (B) is correct and (C) is incorrect. (D) is incorrect because the compromise itself is consideration for the oral agreement. (A) is incorrect because the Statute of Frauds may bar subsequent oral modification of contracts to which it is applicable, but it is not applicable to the services contract here. 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

\section{Answer to Question 156}

(C) The circumstances show that the requirement that MacDougall Corporation realize a savings of 2,000 work-hours per restaurant was an express condition of the contract, and TM explicitly assumed the risk of meeting this condition. Therefore, substantial performance of the contract is not sufficient, nor is the actual savings achieved, which was less than promised. Thus, (A) and (B) are wrong. (D) is wrong because certification by MacDougall's CEO was never made a condition of the contract.

\section{Answer to Question 157}

(D) TM will likely succeed because MacDougall will otherwise be unjustly enriched by getting the system without having to pay the second installment. Where quasi-contractual relief is used to remedy a failed or unenforceable contract, all that is necessary is that the failed contract result in unjust enrichment of one of the parties. Even a party who has breached a contract (and therefore cannot enforce it) can recover in quasi-contract under the modern view as long as the breach did not involve seriously wrongful or unconscionable conduct. Hence, neither the failure of the express condition (A) nor the breach of contract claim (B) would preclude TM from recovering in quasi-contract for the reasonable value of its services. (C) is not as good a choice as (D) because all that is necessary to recover in a failed contract situation is that the other party would otherwise be unjustly enriched. Where there is no contractual relationship between the parties, the party seeking quasi-contractual relief must specifically show that his expectation of being compensated is reasonable and that the benefits were conferred at the express or implied request of the defendant, but those elements are assumed when the unjust enrichment occurs in a failed contract situation. Hence, (D) states the rule in this situation more accurately than (C).

\section{Answer to Question 158}

(C) The court will likely deny the motion because Congress generally has the power to condition federal spending if Congress reasonably finds that the spending program is for the general welfare. (A) is incorrect because the federal government determines how the funds are to be expended, not the recipient. Thus, while it may be arguable that the city's plan is a better way to use the money, the fact remains that the money was given for one purpose only and it must be expended for that purpose. Hence, $(\mathrm{B})$ is wrong because the federal government in this situation does have the authority to control the spending of its funds and it is not an interference with the state's sovereign powers. (D) is wrong because the doctrine of sovereignty does not just extend to the state's executive or legislative branch, but to all governmental activities and entities within the state.

\section{Answer to Question 159}

(D) Since Thomas did not retain a right to revoke the escrow, his delivery of the deed to Kenneth completes the conveyance. Title passes to Ben automatically on Thomas's death and "relates back" to the date of delivery to Kenneth. Thus, Thomas's home was not his property at his death, and it cannot pass to Sally. Thus, (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because recording is a form of protection; it is not required to convey property. (C) is incorrect because execution of the deed alone is not enough to convey title; delivery is also required for a valid conveyance.

\section{Answer to Question 160}

(D) Burglary requires a specific intent to commit a crime and intoxication might negate the existence of that intent. In the circumstances of the problem, Jesse could argue with some force that he did not intend to kill the MP or act with premeditation, but must account for the fact that the killing occurred in what could be characterized as a burglary, which would be murder under the statutes of the jurisdiction. Thus, if Jesse did not have the requisite intent, he did not commit burglary and so the killing does not fall under the felony murder part of the statute. Jesse can therefore be convicted only if he acted intentionally or with premeditation. (A) is incorrect because voluntary intoxication is not a defense unless it negates intent; (A) concerns the issue of causation. (B) is wrong because it states the wrong standard of proof-the prosecution must prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. $(\mathrm{C})$ is wrong because voluntary intoxication may be a defense to the felony murder definition of murder.

\section{Answer to Question 161}

(B) Voluntary intoxication has historically been treated as the equivalent of recklessness for the reasons outlined in (B). (A) is wrong because intoxication is the crucial issue; drinking was a major part of Jesse's conscious risk taking. (C) is wrong because voluntary intoxication is a defense to some crimes. (D) is wrong; it is irrelevant what the common law definition of manslaughter is because here there is a statute defining the crime.

\section{Answer to Question 162}

(B) The general rule is that a minor's conduct is judged by the standard applicable to an ordinarily prudent minor of the same age, experience, and intelligence in similar circumstances. Thus, (A) is wrong. The fact that Jack is almost an adult does not make this rule inapplicable, but would affect the level of care to which he would be held. Therefore, (C) is wrong. (D) is a misstatement of law; strict liability does not apply.

\section{Answer to Question 163}

(C) Whether Jack possessed the requisite intent for battery is determined by the substantial certainty that a harmful or offensive contact would result from his intentional action. Even if Jack did not mean to hurt anyone, he knew that at least an offensive contact would result from putting the bucket on the door. Under the circumstances, such contact was practically inevitable, even though Jack's plans were not carried out exactly as he intended, since the "wrong" victim was struck. Under the transferred intent doctrine, Jack's intent is transferred from his father to Walt. If liable for an intentional tort, Jack would also be liable for the "lesser" torts of negligence and reckless conduct.

\section{Answer to Question 164}

(C) Since Opal had a scheme for an exclusively residential subdivision that included these lots when the sales began, a court will imply a reciprocal negative servitude limiting the remaining lots to the same use. (A) is incorrect because Opal also covenanted to restrict the lots to single-family use. (B) is incorrect, because if there is a reciprocal negative covenant, it would apply whether or not the deeds specifically contained the provision. Fun Spa's actual knowledge is not the issue; Fun Spa must have had actual notice, record notice, or, as is likely here, inquiry notice ( $e$.g., neighborhood appears to conform to common restriction). Thus, (D) is not the best answer.

\section{Answer to Question 165}

(B) The government can place reasonable restrictions on time, place, and manner of speech in public forums. It would be difficult to envision more reasonable ordinances than the ones involved here. Therefore (B) is correct, since it states the appropriate rule. (D) is wrong, since a facial challenge requires that there be no conceivable circumstances under which the ordinance could be constitutionally applied, and that is clearly not the case here. (A) is wrong; the unconstitutionality of the ordinance could be raised for the first time as a defense in the criminal case. Under accepted principles of comity, Jim does not have to go to federal court to litigate federal constitutional claims. (C) is wrong because even if the law represents the "will of the people," it could still be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has emphasized repeatedly that constitutional rights are neither subject to, nor can be compromised by, a "vote of the people."

\section{Answer to Question 166}

(A) A birthdate (other than that of a famous person such as George Washington) is not the type of fact that a court will recognize as true without formal presentation of evidence (e.g., presentation of a certified copy of a birth certificate). Under the Federal Rules, courts may judicially notice a fact that is (i) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the court or (ii) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. Records of any state or federal court may be judicially noticed; they are easily verifiable. Thus, (B) is incorrect. (C) can be determined by consulting an almanac. It is therefore a manifest fact and can properly be noticed. The grounds for judicial notice of (D) are several: it is common knowledge, it is easily verifiable by reference to a calendar, and the state holiday is subject to judicial notice as a state law.

\section{Answer to Question 167}

(C) The only basis of liability that Prentiss could use in his suit is negligence-i.e., that Doreen negligently selected and stored the fertilizer. If Doreen acted reasonably in selecting and storing the fertilizer, she will prevail. (A) is wrong because Doreen would not be liable simply because other fertilizers were available. (B) is wrong because property owners are not strictly liable for all emissions from their property. There is no suggestion that the storage of the fertilizer was an ultrahazardous activity that would allow Prentiss to bring a strict liability action. (D) is wrong despite the fact that Prentiss's lack of property rights in the land would preclude him from maintaining a nuisance action; he could still maintain a negligence action as a foreseeable victim of negligent conduct. (C) is the best answer because it precludes this result.

\section{Answer to Question 168}

(A) A witness other than the accused may be impeached by (i) any felony conviction (unless the judge determines that its probative value is substantially outweighed by Rule 403 considerations) and (ii) conviction of any other crime requiring proof or admission of an act of dishonesty or false statement. [Fed. R. Evid. 609(a)] Embezzlement is both. The fact that an appeal is pending does not affect the admissibility of the conviction; thus, $(B)$ is incorrect. The official record of judgment is always admissible proof that the judgment was entered; $(C)$ is therefore incorrect. While the proposition in (D) is correct, it does not apply to proof of prior convictions. A prior conviction may be shown either by cross-examination of the witness or introducing a record of judgment.

\section{Answer to Question 169}

(A) A treaty is the supreme law of the land, and state statutes that conflict with ratified treaties are invalid. (B) and (C) state incorrect rules of law. The federal government may exercise its property powers to acquire control of free roaming animals on public land. The federal government does not, however, have inherent authority over or ownership of all "free roaming wildlife." A state may, in turn, assert some rights over animals within its borders. That power must, nevertheless, give way in the face of a valid exercise of federal power. (D) is wrong because a treaty, being the supreme law of the land, takes precedence over the rights reserved to the state under the Tenth Amendment.

\section{Answer to Question 170}

(A) A grantor may deliver a deed to an escrowee with instructions that it be delivered to the grantee when certain conditions (e.g., death of the grantor) are met. When the conditions occur, title passes automatically to the grantee and relates back to the date of delivery to the escrowee. Thus, (D) is incorrect. (B) is not as good an answer because the facts given are insufficient to conclude that the note is a valid conveyance. To work a conveyance, the note would have to include the names of the grantor and grantee, operative words of conveyance (questionable here), a description of the land, and the grantor's signature. (C) and (D) are wrong because deeds may be effective to convey property although recorded after the grantor's death or although the grantor remains in possession after executing the deed.

\section{Answer to Question 171}

(D) To convict for attempt, the prosecutor must establish that the defendant (i) had the specific intent to commit the crime; and (ii) engaged in behavior that constituted a substantial step toward commission of the crime and was strongly corroborative of the defendant's criminal purpose. In (A), Walter could be found guilty of attempted murder. He had the specific intent to kill, and the jury could find he took a substantial step toward commission of the crime. In (B), Yvette could be found guilty of attempting to obtain property by false pretenses. She had the specific intent to commit the crime, and the jury could find she took a substantial step toward commission of it. In (C), Hazel could be found guilty of attempted robbery; she had the specific intent, and the jury could find the necessary act. In (D), Farley could not be guilty of attempt. Since the activity he was engaging in, and intending to engage in, is not illegal, he cannot be found guilty of attempt even if he thought he was engaging in criminal conduct. This is the doctrine of legal impossibility.

\section{Answer to Question 172}

(D) This ordinance is too broad. The Supreme Court has defined obscenity as a description or depiction of sexual conduct that taken as a whole, by the average person, applying contemporary community standards, appeals to the prurient interest in sex, portrays sex in a patently offensive way, and using a reasonable person standard, does not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Thus, under this definition, not all nudity is obscene. (A) is incorrect because although the town may try to protect its minors, that purpose does not allow it to prohibit all such advertisements. The ordinance is too broad to be valid and its purpose will not save it. (B) is incorrect because if the posters fall within the Court's definition of obscenity, they could be prohibited because obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment. (C) is incorrect because the "average person" in the above definition does not include children.

\section{Answer to Question 173}

(B) Albert's statement is a vicarious admission by a party-opponent. The statement acknowledges significant consumption of alcohol, which could have contributed to the accident. Under the Federal Rules, statements by an agent concerning a matter within the scope of his agency, made during the existence of the relationship, is nonhearsay. Thus, Albert's admission of drinking is admissible against his employer, and (D) is therefore incorrect. (A) is incorrect because the statement against interest exception requires that the declarant be unavailable as a witness. The facts do not indicate that Albert is unavailable. (C) is incorrect because the excited utterance exception requires that the statement concern the immediate facts of the startling occurrence. Albert's admission of drinking does not concern the immediate facts of the accident. Moreover, (A) and (C) are hearsay exceptions, and the Federal Rules do not recognize Albert's statement as hearsay.

\section{Answer to Question 174}

(A) Where plaintiff is well-known, so that her name and likeness have commercial value, using plaintiff's name or likeness for commercial purposes without permission is an invasion of privacy. (B) is wrong. There is generally no violation of one's right of privacy when her picture is taken in a public place. (C) is wrong. In the absence of actual consent or some other recognized privilege, the appropriation is actionable. Department Store's good faith belief that consent was obtained is no defense. (D) is wrong because Actress's status as a public figure bolsters this type of invasion of privacy charge (commercial appropriation) rather than diminishes it.

\section{Answer to Question 175}

(A) Since Betty installed the equipment without any intention to benefit her landlord, the chattels have not become fixtures, and she is entitled to remove them at the end of the lease term if she repairs any damage done by the removal. (B) is wrong because the Statute of Frauds does not preclude the bank from claiming an interest in chattels that have become fixtures and thus part of the real estate, and are nonremovable. (C) is wrong since Betty's notice of the mortgage is immaterial. The mortgagee's rights are no greater than those of the landlord herself, so the same issue could arise even without any mortgage being involved in the question. (D) is wrong because personal property that a tenant attaches to the real property may become a fixture (and thus part of the real property) if the tenant intended to improve the realty.

\section{Answer to Question 176}

(B) If Alice had installed the chattels herself, clearly Betty would have no right to remove them upon termination of a lease. The bank acting under its mortgage would be entitled to treat the items as part of the real estate since it is reasonable to assume that chattels attached to realty by the owner of the real property were intended to be a permanent part of the property as fixtures. Thus, (A) and (C) are incorrect. (D) is wrong because the mortgage need not expressly mention personal property in the event that the personal property in question had been so attached to the real estate as to become fixtures.

\section{Answer to Question 177}

(A) The fact that no police officer has been terminated during probation except for cause may be enough for Ruby to show that she has a right to a hearing. Continued public employment may be a protected property interest if there is a clear practice or mutual understanding that an employee can be terminated only for "cause." If Ruby can establish this, she will be able to force the city to give her a reason for her termination and a hearing. (C) is incorrect because a general increase in police officer positions does not establish a specific right to employment for Ruby. (B) is wrong because there is nothing in the Constitution that requires that a city follow any particular method of employment practice, as long as the method chosen by a city does not violate some constitutional prohibition. The fact that the city's civil service law was not changed to reflect the additional period of time a police officer spends in the police academy does not create a right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. (D) also states facts that could give rise to an equal protection, rather than due process, claim. 

\section{Answer to Question 178}

(C) While on probation, Ruby was subject to being fired at any time. Thus, she had no right in the nature of a property right and, constitutionally, would not be entitled to a hearing. (A), (B), and (D) are all arguable reasons for terminating Ruby's employment. However, just because the city might have had a valid reason for firing her, it does not follow that, if she were otherwise entitled to a hearing, the city could forgo it. (A), in addition, is not a good argument if the standard by which Ruby was tested was an artificial standard based solely on the physical differences between men and women, having no rational relationship to the needs of the job of a police officer.

\section{Answer to Question 179}

(B) There is no evidence that Driver was negligent. Thus, he can recover the full amount of his damages regardless of the jurisdiction's adoption of comparative negligence. (A) and (D) are wrong since one spouse's negligence is ordinarily not imputed to the other. (C) is wrong because this is not the proper use of the last clear chance doctrine, which is used by plaintiffs to rebut a contributory negligence defense, not by defendants to defend a negligence claim, and is not applicable in comparative negligence jurisdictions.

\section{Answer to Question 180}

(B) Rider's negligence will proportionately reduce her recovery (even if greater than that of Reckless). (A) is incorrect because Rider's damages will be reduced by the amount of her own fault, regardless of whether Driver was negligent. (C) is incorrect because the last clear chance doctrine is used by plaintiffs to counter a contributory negligence defense, not by defendants to defend a negligence claim, and is not applicable in comparative negligence jurisdictions. (D) is incorrect because pure comparative fault allocates liability based on the percentage of a tortfeasor's fault, not on the basis of who is "primarily" at fault.

\section{Answer to Question 181}

(B) Jenny is liable as an accessory after the fact because she helped Joey to escape arrest. An accessory after the fact is one who receives, relieves, comforts, or assists another knowing that he has committed a felony, in order to help the felon escape arrest, trial, or conviction. The felony must be completed at the time the aid is rendered. Joey committed the felony of car theft. Although Jenny was emotionally disturbed and of borderline mental retardation, she understood what Joey had done and that the police were after him. Knowing these things, Jenny decided to help Joey escape the police, and she actively assisted him by doing much of the driving to the mountains to avoid the police. Thus, Jenny knowingly assisted a felon in an effort to help him escape apprehension. This conduct renders Jenny liable as an accessory after the fact. Because Jenny is liable for the common law crime of being an accessory after the fact, (D) is incorrect. (A) is incorrect because Jenny and Joey did not enter into an agreement to commit car theft. A conspiracy is a combination or agreement between two or more persons to accomplish some unlawful purpose, or to accomplish a lawful purpose by unlawful means. Conspiracy requires: (i) an agreement between two or more persons; (ii) an intent to enter into an agreement; and (iii) an intent to achieve the objective of the agreement. Each conspirator is liable for the crimes of all other conspirators if: (i) the crimes were committed in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy; and (ii) the crimes were a natural and probable consequence of the conspiracy. Here, there was no agreement between Jenny and Joey to accomplish the theft of the car by mutual action. Jenny did not even meet Joey until after he had stolen the car, at which time she agreed to help him escape capture. Helping Joey escape capture after the completion of the car theft does not make Jenny a co-conspirator with regard to the theft itself. (C) is incorrect because compounding a felony consists of entering into an agreement for valuable consideration not to prosecute another for a felony or to conceal the commission of a felony or the whereabouts of a felon. Although Jenny helped to conceal the whereabouts of Joey, she did so simply because of her dislike for the police. Jenny did not agree to conceal Joey's whereabouts in exchange for valuable consideration. Therefore, Jenny is not guilty of compounding a felony.

\section{Answer to Question 182}

(D) If a reasonable person would have regarded the theft as essential to avoid starvation, Jenny will be deemed to have acted under the defense of necessity. Conduct otherwise criminal is justifiable if, as a result of pressure from natural forces, the defendant reasonably believes that the conduct is necessary to avoid harm to society exceeding the harm caused by the conduct. The defense of necessity is to be contrasted with the excuse of duress, under which a person is not guilty of an offense, other than homicide, if she performs an otherwise criminal act under the threat of imminent infliction of death or great bodily harm, provided that she reasonably believes death or great bodily harm will be inflicted on herself or on a member of her immediate family if she does not perform such conduct. Here, Joey threatened to drive off and leave Jenny to starve in the mountains. Although this threat came directly from a human source, rather than from natural forces, the actual harm with which Jenny was faced emanated from the physical need for food. Because the defense of necessity requires an objective test, it is necessary that Jenny have had a reasonable belief that she had to steal the food to avoid starvation, which would have been a greater societal harm than the theft. If Jenny had such a belief, and it was reasonable, she has a valid defense of necessity and is not guilty. (B) is incorrect because an otherwise criminal act can be justified if there is a reasonable belief that such an act is necessary to avoid an even greater harm to society. Certainly, a threat of starvation would present a greater harm than that posed by the theft of Fisher's food. Consequently, a threat of starvation can justify an act that is otherwise criminal. (A) is incorrect because it implies that Jenny's conduct is excused by duress. As noted previously, Joey did not threaten Jenny with imminent death if she failed to steal the food. The threat with which Jenny was faced was one of eventual starvation if Joey left her in the mountains. Thus, it cannot be said that Joey's "direction" actually exerted any coercion or duress over Jenny. (C) is incorrect because larceny (of which petit theft is a variety) requires for asportation that the property be moved (even if only slightly) and that such movement be part of a carrying away process. Jenny moved the sandwich from Fisher's ice chest to her mouth and took a bite out of it. Although this movement may have been slight, it was certainly part of a carrying away process.

\section{Answer to Question 183}

(C) Joey's failure to determine whether Fisher was dead or alive when Joey and Jenny threw Fisher into the stream constitutes criminal negligence, and when a death is caused by criminal negligence, it is involuntary manslaughter. Criminal negligence requires a greater deviation from the reasonable person standard than is required for civil liability. The defendant must have taken a very unreasonable risk in light of the utility of his conduct, knowledge of the facts, and the nature and extent of the harm that may be caused. Joey's conduct in throwing Fisher into the stream was designed merely to disguise the fact that Fisher had been hit on the head and apparently killed by Jenny. Such conduct has no social utility. In addition, Joey was certainly aware that, if Fisher was not actually dead, throwing him into the stream would most likely result in his death by drowning. Thus, Joey acted with a sufficiently high degree of deviation from the reasonable person standard of care as to constitute criminal negligence. This negligence caused the death of Fisher. Therefore, the killing is involuntary manslaughter. (A) is incorrect because an excusable homicide is one for which there is a defense to criminal liability. Joey's guilt of involuntary manslaughter means that the death of Fisher is the result of criminal homicide rather than excusable homicide. (B) is incorrect because the killing of Fisher was not intentional. An intentional killing is reduced from murder to voluntary manslaughter if the defendant committed the killing under a provocation that would arouse sudden and intense passion in an ordinary person such as to cause him to lose self-control, and there was insufficient time between the provocation and the killing for the passions of a reasonable person to cool. As noted above, Joey's act resulting in the death of Fisher was not intentional, but was rather committed as a consequence of criminal negligence. In addition, Joey was not acting under any provocation that would have reduced an intentional killing to voluntary manslaughter. For these reasons, the killing is not voluntary manslaughter. (D) is incorrect because Joey did not act with malice aforethought. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought exists if the defendant: (i) intends to kill; (ii) intends to inflict great bodily injury; (iii) is aware of an unjustifiably high risk to human life; or (iv) intends to commit a felony. It is theoretically possible that Joey could be convicted of murder based on awareness of an unjustifiably high risk to human life (depraved heart). However, a finding that Joey acted unreasonably would not establish this state of mind. When Joey threw Fisher into the stream, he was most likely acting with criminal negligence rather than with any of the states of mind that would constitute malice aforethought. Therefore, Joey is not guilty of murder.

\section{Answer to Question 184}

(C) Larceny is a specific intent crime that requires that the defendant intend to permanently deprive the owner of his property. If Defendant can show that he really believed the car to be his own, there is no intent to deprive the owner of his property, and, therefore, Defendant is not guilty of larceny. (A) is wrong because battery is a general intent crime that can arise out of a showing of gross negligence. Shooting at a residence is gross negligence and can support a finding of battery even if the defendant does not know that anyone is home. $(\mathrm{B})$ is obviously wrong because the defendant's criminal act does not lie in the fact that he did not see the child in time, but in the fact that he was driving while intoxicated, and it was his intoxication (grossly negligent conduct) that caused him to be unable to see the child in time. (D) is an interesting problem. The defendant in this case was drunk at the corner bar when the child was killed, so it cannot be determined whether this defendant was the cause of the fire. However, a parent has an obligation at common law to supervise and protect her children. Since the defendant left this child alone and unsupervised, it is possible that the defendant could be charged with involuntary manslaughter when the child was accidentally killed. The fact that she was intoxicated at the time would not be a defense to a charge of involuntary manslaughter arising out of the fact that this child was left alone.

\section{Answer to Question 185}

(C) If offers stating precisely the same terms cross in the mail, they do not give rise to a contract. An offer cannot be accepted if there is no knowledge of it. The letters sent by Mom and Huck constitute crossing offers, of which there was no acceptance. Thus, there is no contract. (B) is incorrect; it is a misstatement of the law. (A) is incorrect because, under the U.C.C., a reasonable price will be supplied by the court unless the parties have shown that they do not want a contract until they have agreed on price. Here, the May 15 writing indicates that Mom and Huck did not intend to be contractually bound until they agreed on a price. As explained above, the crossing letters do not indicate an agreement on price. (D) is an incorrect statement of the law.

\section{Answer to Question 186}

(C) The validity of a law that regulates elections is determined by a balancing test. If the law regulates "core political speech," rather than the process surrounding elections, strict scrutiny is 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

applied (i.e., the law must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest). The Supreme Court has held that a state law prohibiting campaigning on election day is invalid as applied to a newspaper editorial urging voters to vote a certain way, because the right to comment on political issues is an essential element of free speech. The State Yellow statute here at issue is similar to the law that was held invalid by the Court; thus, its enforcement should be enjoined on free speech grounds. (A) does not offer a very good argument for the paper. It is true that the regulation affects interstate commerce because the newspaper is circulated in other states. However, because the regulation does not directly burden interstate commerce (i.e., it does not discriminate against interstate commerce by favoring local economic interests), the newspaper must argue that the burden on interstate commerce outweighs the promotion of legitimate local interests. Here, the local interest of promoting fair elections is quite strong, and the burden on interstate commerce is very weak. Therefore, the Commerce Clause argument is not very strong. (B) is incorrect because the statute in fact does not affect the newspaper's right to distribute the paper; it merely prohibits the paper from containing certain material on certain days. (D) would not be a good argument because the Equal Protection Clause only prohibits setting up classes to treat similar persons or groups in a dissimilar manner. Here, all similar entities (newspapers) are treated alike-none is allowed to publish political editorials the day before and the day of an election. The fact that the same material can be printed on other days does not create an equal protection problem.

\section{Answer to Question 187}

(D) Moms's proposed testimony about Victor's statement ('I'm going to die. The car that hit me had license number DD666!") is hearsay evidence. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. [Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)] Since it appears that Victor's statement is being offered to establish that the car that hit him had license number DD666, it is hearsay. Nevertheless, it is admissible under the "excited utterance" exception to the hearsay rule. Hence, (D) is correct. At first glance it might seem that the "dying declaration" exception to the hearsay rule applies as well. [See Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(2)] There is no indication, however, that the declarant (Victor) is unavailable to testify, a prerequisite for admitting evidence under the dying declaration exception. [Fed. R. Evid. 804(a)] Victor is a party and thus would seem to be available to testify. If Victor were to testify that he had no memory as to the license number, he would be considered unavailable [Fed. R. Evid. 804(a)(3)], but there is no indication that Victor has so testified. Therefore, the dying declaration exception does not apply, and (C) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because Moms's proposed testimony is admissible under the hearsay exception for "excited utterances." [Fed. R. Evid. 803(2)] This hearsay exception, like most, does not require the declarant to be unavailable as a condition for the admission of hearsay evidence. It merely requires that the hearsay statement relate to a startling event or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. Victor's statement relates to a startling event (the car crash) that prompted the statement. Because the statement was made so soon after the crash, while Victor was badly injured, it probably constitutes an excited utterance. Moms's testimony is highly probative in establishing that Dick Devilish was driving the car that struck Victor. (A) is incorrect in asserting that Moms's testimony is inadmissible because it is more prejudicial than probative. Moms's testimony is in no sense unfairly prejudicial to Devilish.

\section{Answer to Question 188}

(C) There are six exceptions to the warrant requirement. The only exception applicable to this case is a search incident to a lawful arrest. However, if an arrest is unlawful, then any search incident to that arrest is also unlawful. At common law a police officer could not make a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor unless it was committed in his presence. While it is unclear whether a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor not committed in the officer's presence would violate the Fourth Amendment, practically all states follow the common law rule. Because Mary did not commit the misdemeanor of disorderly conduct in the presence of the officer, his arrest and accompanying search were invalid. It follows that (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because it simply states the geographic scope of a search incident to a lawful arrest. (D) is incorrect because Miranda warnings, which protect a person's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, do not generally affect seizure of evidence, and would not affect the seizure in this case.

\section{Answer to Question 189}

(C) The jeweler is entitled to recover $\$ 400$ because, upon attaining the age of majority, Shelley affirmed the contract as to her ring at that price. Infants generally lack legal capacity to incur binding contractual obligations. Contracts entered into by infants are voidable at this election unless the contract is for a "necessity." On reaching majority, an infant may affirm; i.e., choose to be bound by her contract. Here, at the time of entering into the contract for the two rings, Shelley was not yet 18 years old (the applicable age of majority). Because a wedding ring is not a necessity, Shelley's contract was voidable at her option. However, when Shelley went back to see the jeweler, she had reached the age of 18 . At that time, she chose to be bound by the contract, although her affirmation was limited to her ring (instead of both rings), and to a lower price for her ring than that which was originally agreed upon. When a voidable promise is reaffirmed, the promise will be enforced according to the terms of the reaffirmation rather than the original obligation. Thus, Shelley is now bound by her contract, but only for the purchase of $\boldsymbol{h e r}$ ring at a price of $\$ 400$. (D) is incorrect because it ignores the fact that, having affirmed the contract (albeit at different terms), Shelley, who is no longer an infant, is bound to the terms of the reaffirmed contract. (A) is incorrect because $\$ 1,150$ reflects the purchase price of both rings as contained in the original contract. Upon reaching majority, Shelley chose not to be bound by the original contract. Similarly, (B) is incorrect because $\$ 500$ reflects the purchase price of Shelley's ring as contained in the original agreement (as well as the market value of the ring). Upon reaching majority, Shelley could have refused to pay anything. She is now bound only to the contract as affirmed by her, which is for $\$ 400$.

\section{Answer to Question 190}

(C) The doctrine of equitable conversion places the risk of loss on the purchaser as soon as the enforceable contract is entered into. (B) is wrong because "marketable" title does not refer to whether Lynn would be able to sell a destroyed home or not. It refers to a deed free of any possible dispute as to who is the owner of the property. (A) is wrong because the doctrine of equitable conversion applies to the risk of loss and, thus, there is no such implied term in the conveyance or contract. (D) is wrong because equitable conversion puts the risk of loss on Werner and Lynn is entitled to receive the contract price in the specific performance action.

\section{Answer to Question 191}

(B) Other crimes and wrongdoings of a defendant are sometimes admissible to prove motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plans, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake [Fed. R. Evid. 404 (b)], provided, however, that the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by prejudice or other Rule 403 considerations. On these facts, the probative value of possession of cocaine seems very slight and is highly prejudicial. Therefore, the evidence will probably be inadmissible. (A) is wrong. Other crime evidence is sometimes admissible to show motive, opportunity, etc., even if the defendant does not place his character in issue. Also, if the defendant offers evidence of good character, the prosecutor cannot for that reason alone offer 

\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}

extrinsic evidence of specific crimes. (C) is wrong. The issue is whether Donald murdered Vincent during a burglary, not what he did with the money. It is true that the evidence tends to show that Donald had money, but the probative value that he committed the crime charged would be very slight and clearly outweighed by prejudice. (D) is wrong. If the evidence were offered to prove that Donald is capable of committing serious crimes, it would be inadmissible character evidence.

\section{Answer to Question 192}

(B) The nod constitutes nonverbal conduct intended as an assertion and would thus be considered a "statement" for purposes of the hearsay rule. However, this statement constitutes an admission and hence is not hearsay under Federal Rule 801. (C) is therefore incorrect. Likewise, (A) is incorrect, because (i) an excited utterance is an exception to the hearsay rule and this is not hearsay, and (ii) even if it were hearsay, this does not constitute an excited utterance since the statement was not made during or soon after the startling event and under the stress of that event. (D) is incorrect. Donald responded to the question with a nod. If Donald had failed to respond and the prosecutor wished to introduce his silence as an adoptive admission, then it would be necessary to determine whether there was a reason to respond.

\section{Answer to Question 193}

(B) This is one of the very rare situations in which a distinction on race is likely to be upheld. The government, based on the facts, has a compelling interest in infiltrating the racist group. Due to the nature of the group, a white police officer is obviously necessary for this task. This means the action meets both elements of the strict scrutiny test: the interest is compelling and the means selected are narrowly tailored since no other nondiscriminatory action would work. The increased salary likely reflects the danger of the undercover task, and so is justifiable. (A) is incorrect because the rational basis test is never used for racial discrimination. Strict scrutiny always is employed. (C) is incorrect because even discriminatory conduct is permissible if it is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest and the means selected are narrowly tailored. (D) is incorrect because, based on the facts of the question, the group prohibits association with black persons. Thus, it is highly improbable that a black person could win the confidence of the group.

\section{Answer to Question 194}

(A) Stevens's fax will be considered an offer and Baker's second fax will be considered an acceptance of the offer. Although Baker merely asked for a price quote, Stevens's fax in response will be construed as an offer because the language and surrounding circumstances make it reasonable for Baker to expect that Stevens was willing to enter into a contract. "I can deliver 20 computers ... [for] \$2,000 per computer" coupled with the fact that Stevens knew that Baker wanted to buy 20 computers makes it reasonable for Baker to assume that Stevens was manifesting a promise, undertaking, or commitment to enter into a contract, especially since the terms were so specific here as to quantity, price, and delivery date. Baker's response was an acceptance of Stevens's offer to sell the computers. (B) is wrong because Stevens's fax was the offer, not the acceptance. Baker's initial fax could not be construed as an offer because it did not manifest present contractual intent and was not definite as to the terms. Therefore, (C) is also wrong. (D) is wrong because Stevens's fax was definite enough to be an offer. The U.C.C. does not require the same degree of formality as the common law, and so a contract was clearly formed when Baker responded with the fax.

\section{Answer to Question 195}

(A) The fact that Baker was to pay the $\$ 10,000$ when he received his last payment from City would be interpreted as a provision setting the time for payment rather than the source from which the payment was to come, because the price was clearly set at $\$ 40,000$ and was not expressly made conditional on City's paying Baker. Therefore, Baker could not claim that since he had not received payment from City he did not have to pay Stevens. Thus, (C) and (D) are incorrect. (B) is incorrect because it misstates the law.

\section{Answer to Question 196}

(C) I. is incorrect. The taking of land through eminent domain results in the taking of all interests in the land. II. is incorrect. It is true that Red may not continue to occupy the land and that he is free of his rent obligation, but he will share in the condemnation award. III. is correct. Since the leasehold interest is a property interest, Red has a constitutional right to compensation for the property interest taken through eminent domain. Compensation will be determined by the value of the estate, less the rent Red no longer is required to pay. Thus, (C) is correct, and (A), (B), and (D) are wrong.

\section{Answer to Question 197}

(C) Sal should not be given benefits. The Supreme Court in Weinberger $v$. Salfi (1975) held that the government does not have to show a compelling reason for denying noncontractual benefits. Sal's rights were noncontractual, and the only obligation of the government was to show that the classification of nine months served some proper governmental purpose. The Court stated that the purpose behind the requirement is to prevent sham marriages (i.e., those solely to qualify for benefits). Thus, (A) and (B) are wrong. (D) is wrong. It implies that distinctions predicated on gender are appropriate in the face of a claim that more women than men would qualify for the benefits, a proposition the Court has rejected on numerous occasions.

\section{Answer to Question 198}

(C) Pops's proposed testimony about Velma's statement ("I'm going to die. Danny Deft shot me.") is hearsay evidence. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. [Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)] Since it appears that Velma's statement is being offered to establish that Danny did the shooting, it is hearsay. Nevertheless, it is admissible under the "dying declaration" exception to the hearsay rule. For a dying declaration to be admissible, two prerequisites must be met: (i) The declarant must be unavailable to testify. [Fed. R. Evid. 804(a)] Velma, being dead, obviously is unavailable to testify. (ii) A dying declaration can only be admitted in certain kinds of cases - homicide prosecutions and civil cases. [Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(2)] This is an appropriate case, a murder prosecution. This hearsay exception further requires that the declarant's statement be made while believing her death to be imminent, and that the statement concern the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be impending death. [Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(2)] Velma believed her death was imminent. She was bleeding profusely from being shot and gasped, "I' $\mathrm{m}$ going to die." In addition, her statement ("Danny Deft shot me") pertained to the cause or circumstances of her death. Pops's proposed testimony might also be admissible under the hearsay exception for "excited utterances." Rule 803(2) makes admissible a hearsay statement relating to a startling event or condition, made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. Certainly one could argue that Velma's statement was an excited utterance. But the question does not make clear that her statement was made while under the stress of excitement. Thus, while (D) is a plausible answer, $(\mathrm{C})$ is better because Velma's statement fits so precisely within the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule. $(\mathrm{B})$ is clearly wrong because it asserts that the statement does not fit within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. (A) is wrong. Pops's testimony obviously would be highly probative in establishing that Danny murdered Velma. (A) nonetheless asserts that the testimony should be inadmissible because it is more prejudicial than probative. This answer is incorrect because it fundamentally misconceives the concept of prejudice in the context of the Rule 403 probative value/prejudicial impact balancing test. The only kind of prejudice that can properly be balanced under this test is unfair prejudice. The "prejudice" surrounding the admission of Pops's testimony is not in any sense unfair; it is merely the natural result of any evidence having such persuasive force. In other words, it is prejudicial only in the sense that it will harm Danny's defense because it is highly probative of the fact that Danny killed Velma.

\section{Answer to Question 199}

(C) If the telephone company is found to be negligent, it will be liable despite the posting of warning notices. A finding of negligence establishes the prima facie elements of duty and breach in a negligence action. The other elements of actual cause, proximate cause, and damages are indicated by the facts. As discussed below, the telephone company's defenses to negligence will not be successful; hence, Marcus's mother will win. (A) is incorrect because Marcus appears to have been attracted to the trench by the warning sign, which was not readable from the street, and he was injured only while attempting to leave the site of the excavation. Therefore, his conduct in walking up to the sign was not contributorily negligent, nor did he knowingly and voluntarily assume any risk by reading the sign. (B) is wrong because assumption of risk requires that plaintiff know of the risk as well as voluntarily assume it. Marcus cannot be said to have known of a risk that the edge of the excavation would give way. Although knowledge may be implied where the risk is one that the average person would clearly appreciate, the court will take into account the plaintiff's age and any other relevant circumstances. It is unlikely that a court would find that an average seventh-grader would appreciate the unstable nature of the edge of the trench in the dusk. (D) is incorrect because strict liability would only be imposed if excavations were considered ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous activities. For an activity to be ultrahazardous, it (i) must involve a risk of serious harm to persons or property, (ii) must not be capable of being performed with complete safety no matter how much care is taken, and (iii) must not be a commonly engaged-in activity in the community. Although involving a risk of serious harm, an excavation generally is not classified as an ultrahazardous activity because it can be done safely and is a fairly common activity. (Note that even if you were not sure whether courts treated excavations as ultrahazardous activities, (C) would be the better choice because the only difficult issue in a negligence action under these facts is breach of duty, and that is resolved by the additional facts in the choice.)

\section{Answer to Question 200}

(D) A statement is only considered to be voluntary if it is the product of a free and rational choice. If from the surrounding circumstances it appears that the statement was produced by either physical or mental coercion, it will not be considered to be voluntary. While it is a judgment for the court as to whether the confession would be voluntary or involuntary, the lengthy interrogation would probably result in a finding that the confession was involuntary. If the confession is determined to be involuntary, the evidence obtained as a direct result of the confession will probably be suppressed as the fruit of the poisonous tree. (A) is incorrect because evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant is inadmissible if the warrant was improperly issued. (B) is incorrect because Breeze is not basing his motion to suppress on the search of the garage but on the illegally obtained statement. (C) is incorrect because a warrant may be issued on the basis of such uncorroborated statements.

\section{Question 1}

Dennis robbed a bank and fled in a getaway car driven by an accomplice, not realizing that one of the bundles of money he took had the serial numbers recorded and had a tiny tracking device attached to the wrapper. The bank contacted its security consultant, who obtained portable tracking equipment and was able to trace the bundle of money to Dennis's house. The police were notified and they arrived at Dennis's house a few hours after the robbery. They knocked on the door and announced their presence, and saw someone matching the description of the robber in the hallway. They entered and arrested the suspect, Dennis, and then conducted a protective sweep of the house for the accomplice, who they believed had a gun. They did not find him, but while checking a closet they discovered several of the bundles of money from the bank and a gun Dennis had used in the robbery. The police also discovered two clear plastic bags of what appeared to be marijuana sitting on top of a dresser. They seized the money, the gun, and the two bags; later testing confirmed that the substance in the bags was marijuana.

Dennis was charged with the bank robbery and with possession of the marijuana. At a preliminary hearing, he moves to suppress introduction of the money, gun, and marijuana.

The court should:

(A) Grant the motion as to the marijuana but not as to the money or the gun because the money and gun were found as a result of the protective sweep for Dennis's accomplice.

(B) Grant the motion as to the money and the gun but not as to the marijuana because the bags containing the marijuana were clearly visible on the dresser during the search.

(C) Grant the motion as to all of the evidence seized.

(D) Deny the motion as to all of the evidence seized. Questions 2-3 are based on the following fact situation:

In a writing signed by both parties, Paul Plannah, a renowned architect, agreed for a fee of $\$ 25,000$ to design and supervise construction of a new house for Phoebe Threedee, a famous sculptor, the fee to be paid upon completion of the house. Plannah and Threedee got along poorly and, when the design plans were about two-thirds complete, they had a heated argument over the proper location of a marble staircase. Hoping to avoid such encounters, Plannah, without Threedee's knowledge, assigned to Donna Drafty, a newly licensed architect practicing solo, "all of my rights and duties under my design and construction-supervision contract with Threedee." Drafty expressly promised Plannah to carry out the work to the best of Drafty's ability.

2. For this question only, assume that Threedee, on learning of the assignment, refused to allow Drafty to proceed as architect and brought an action against Plannah to compel him to resume and complete performance of the contract.

Is Threedee entitled to such relief?
(A) Yes, because Plannah's services under the contract are unique.
(B) Yes, because Plannah has personally completed two-thirds of the design work.
(C) No, because the Plannah-Threedee contract is one for personal services by Plannah.
(D) No, because Plannah effectively delegated his remaining duties under the Plannah-Threedee contract to Drafty.


3. For this question only, assume that Threedee allowed Drafty to proceed with the design work, but that Drafty, without legal excuse, abandoned the project shortly after construction began.

Which of the following legal conclusions are correct?

I. Plannah is liable to Threedee for legal damages, if any, caused by Drafty's default.

II. Drafty is liable to Threedee for legal damages, if any, caused by Drafty's default.

III. Threedee is indebted to Drafty, on a divisible contract theory, for a prorated portion of the agreed $\$ 25,000$ architect's fee promised to Plannah.
(A) I. and II. only.
(B) I. and III. only.
(C) II. and III. only.
(D) I., II., and III.

\section{Question 4}

Telco, a local telephone company, negligently allowed one of its telephone poles, located between a street and a sidewalk, to become termite-ridden. Rhodes, who was intoxicated and driving at an excessive rate of speed, lost control of her car and hit the weakened telephone pole. One week later, the pole fell and struck Walker, a pedestrian who was walking on the sidewalk. The pole fell because of the combination of the force of the impact and the pole's termite-ridden condition.

If Walker asserts a claim against Telco and Rhodes, will Walker prevail?
(A) Yes, against Telco but not Rhodes.
(B) Yes, against Rhodes but not Telco.
(C) Yes, against Telco and Rhodes, each for one-half of his damages.
(D) Yes, against both Telco and Rhodes for the full amount of his damages.

\section{Question 5}

Percy was shopping in ValuMart, a large department store. ValuMart was remodeling its menswear department and had hired Contractor to do the work. Cora, a carpenter employed by Contractor, was working on the ValuMart job. When Cora left ValuMart to take her lunch break, she left a carpenter's level projecting out into one of the aisles. Before Cora returned from lunch, Percy came down that aisle and tripped over the level. Percy fell and struck his head on the sharp corner of a display case. Percy required hospitalization and sued ValuMart for his injuries.

Will Percy prevail in his suit against ValuMart?

(A) Yes, because Contractor's employee left the level in the aisle.

(B) Yes, if ValuMart's employees had a reasonable time to discover the level before Percy fell.

(C) No, because ValuMart's employees did not leave the level in the aisle.

(D) No, if ValuMart's employees were unaware that the level was in the aisle. Questions 6-7 are based on the following fact situation:

In the recently enacted Fair Opportunity Act, the United States Congress provided, among other things, that an employer whose products are in any way used by or sold to the federal government must meet certain very specific standards for integration of its workforce and affirmative action programs. Both civil and criminal penalties are established for violation of the Act, and it permits private civil suits for injunctive relief or for damages to enforce its provisions.

The city of Davis, California also enacted a jobs opportunity ordinance effective the same year, requiring that any employer doing business with the city have a workforce consonant with the ethnic and gender composition of the population of the city. The local ordinance permits employers to apply for exemptions from its requirements if they can demonstrate that the pool of potential qualified employees has a different mix of ethnicity or gender than the general population. The population of Davis is approximately $55 \%$ female and $45 \%$ male, $75 \%$ white, $10 \%$ Asian, 7\% black, 7\% Hispanic, and $1 \%$ other ethnic backgrounds.

Watson Janitorial Service, a private employer located in the city of Davis, does contract cleaning and maintenance for both the local United States Department of Agriculture office and for the City Jail. Its workforce is $95 \%$ male, $55 \%$ black, $40 \%$ Hispanic, and $5 \%$ other ethnic backgrounds. The city of Davis notified the company that it would either have to bring its workforce into compliance with the local job opportunity ordinance or its contract with the City Jail would be terminated. The United States Department of Justice has notified Watson Janitorial that it meets the guidelines of the Fair Opportunity Act, and that the contract with the Department of Agriculture is not in jeopardy. 6. Watson Janitorial brings an action in state court to enjoin enforcement of the Davis ordinance. It argues that the local rule is invalid since it conflicts with the federal statute by creating more stringent standards. The trial court should rule:

(A) There is no conflict, since Congress intended only that the Fair Opportunity Act apply to employers who dealt exclusively with the federal government.

(B) There is no conflict, since Davis is permitted to impose more strict requirements to a local problem than those established by the federal government.

(C) The federal act preempts the local ordinance and thus the latter cannot be enforced.

(D) The federal act preempts the local ordinance only insofar as it attempts to regulate employers who do business with the federal government, so the ordinance may not be enforced only as to Watson Janitorial, but is otherwise valid.

7. Assume for the purposes of this question only that the United States Department of Agriculture notifies Watson Janitorial that its workforce is in violation of the Fair Opportunity Act and that a referral will be made to the Department of Justice for prosecution unless the federal standards are met within six months. If Watson challenges the validity of the federal statute in court, what is the government's best response to the argument that Congress has exceeded its legitimate powers? I. The act is a valid enforcement of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

II. The act is a valid exercise of the commerce power.

III. The act is a valid exercise of the Enabling Clause of the Thirteenth Amendment.

IV. The act is a valid exercise of the federal police power.
(A) I. and III. only.
(B) II. and III. only.
(C) I. and III. only.
(D) II. and IV. only.

\section{Question 8}

Amp, an electrical contractor, sued Short, a homeowner. Amp alleged that Short refused to pay for extensive wiring repairs performed on Short's home by Wilson, an employee of Amp. Amp called Wilson to the stand as a witness. Wilson, under oath, testified that he did not perform any work at Short's home. Wilson also denied writing a letter to Lee telling Lee that Wilson was going to do electrical work on Short's house. Without releasing Wilson as a witness, Amp offers in evidence the letter written by Wilson to Lee.

If Wilson's letter to Lee is properly authenticated, the trial court should:
(A) Admit the letter for impeachment purposes only.
(B) Admit the letter as both substantive and impeachment evidence.
(C) Exclude the letter because a party may not impeach his own witness.
(D) Exclude the letter because it is inadmissible hearsay.

\section{Question 9}

In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be not guilty of the charge made?

(A) Believing that state law made it a crime to purchase Valium without a prescription, Defendant purchased without a prescription a certain quantity of Valium. Unknown to Defendant, the state legislature had repealed the statute, and Valium could be legally purchased without a prescription. Defendant is charged with attempting to purchase Valium without a prescription.

(B) While in the course of a fight, Defendant, intending to kill Stan, ran up and stabbed Stan from behind. Unknown to Defendant, Stan had been stabbed through the chest only seconds before by another participant in the fight, killing him instantly. Defendant is charged with attempted murder.

(C) Defendant misrepresented his identity to a garage in order to take possession of an automobile that had been left with the garage for repairs earlier that week. The owner of the garage was not deceived and refused to turn over possession. Defendant is charged with attempting to obtain property by false pretenses.

(D) Police arrested Robber as he was leaving a house where he had stolen a good deal of property. As part of a plea-bargain arrangement, Robber took the property to Defendant and offered to sell it. Defendant, believing the property to be stolen, purchased it. Defendant is charged with attempting to receive stolen property. 

\section{Question 10}

The city of Newtown adopted an ordinance providing that street demonstrations involving more than 15 persons may not be held in commercial areas during "rush" hours. "Exceptions" may be made to the prohibition "upon 24-hour advance application to and approval by the police department." The ordinance also imposes sanctions on any person "who shall, without provocation, use to or of another, and in his presence, opprobrious words or abusive language tending to cause a breach of the peace." No court has of yet interpreted the ordinance.

Which of the following is the strongest argument for the unconstitutionality of both parts of the ordinance on their faces?

(A) No type of prior restraint may be imposed on speech in public places.

(B) Laws, regulating by their terms expressive conduct or speech, may not be overbroad or unduly vague.

(C) The determination as to whether public gatherings may be lawfully held cannot be vested in the police.

(D) The right of association in public places without interference is ensured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

\section{Question 11}

Truffle agreed in writing to lease a restaurant site in a newly constructed mall from Lentil, the owner of the property. The term of the tenancy was two years, and rent was payable in monthly installments at the beginning of each month. At the end of the second year, there had been no discussions between Truffle and Lentil regarding renewal or termination. Truffle did not vacate the premises at the end of the term; instead, she sent a check for the next month's rent to Lentil. Lentil cashed the check after the term had expired but informed Truffle that his acceptance of the check did not mean that he was going to renew the lease or let Truffle stay. At the end of that month, Lentil seeks advice on whether he can evict Truffle.

How should Lentil be advised to proceed?

(A) Lentil must give Truffle a full 30 days' notice before beginning eviction proceedings because a month-to-month periodic tenancy has been created.

(B) Lentil may begin eviction proceedings as soon as the additional month has expired.

(C) Lentil may not evict Truffle for 11 months and must give six months' notice before beginning eviction proceedings because a year-to-year periodic tenancy has been created.

(D) Lentil may not evict Truffle for 11 months but need not give any notice prior to eviction because a tenancy for years for a term of one year has been created. 

\section{Question 12}

Dirk broke into Vera's house one night. As he started to stuff silverware into a sack, he was surprised by Vera, who had arrived home earlier than usual. Dirk struck Vera on the head with a candlestick and tied her up. He finished filling his sack and left.

The police discovered Vera several hours later and rushed her to the hospital. Dirk was apprehended by the police early the following morning with the loot still in his possession. He was taken to police headquarters, given Miranda warnings, and asked if he wished to make a statement about the prior evening's events. The police did not mention that Vera had been seriously injured and was in the hospital. Dirk said he understood his rights and was willing to talk. He then admitted that he committed the burglary of Vera's house. The following day, Vera died from injuries caused by the blow to her head.

If, at Dirk's trial for murder, Dirk moves to prevent introduction of the confession into evidence, his motion should most probably be:

(A) Denied, because failure of the police to advise Dirk of Vera's condition was harmless error since felony murder does not require intent to kill or injure.

(B) Denied, because Dirk's waiver of his rights did not depend upon the nature of the charges that were later filed against him.

(C) Granted, because Dirk could not make a knowing and intelligent waiver unless he had information concerning Vera's condition.

(D) Granted, because the use of a confession to burglary in a prosecution for murder violates due process where the police withheld information about the potential seriousness of the offense.

\section{Question 13}

West, a witness in a contract case, testified on direct examination that four people attended a meeting. When asked to identify them, she gave the names of three, but despite trying was unable to remember the name of the fourth person.

The attorney who called her as a witness seeks to show her his handwritten notes of the part of his pretrial interview with her in which she provided all four names.

The trial court is likely to consider the showing of the notes taken as:
(A) A proper attempt to introduce recorded recollection.
(B) A proper attempt to refresh West's recollec- tion.
(C) An improper attempt to lead the witness.
(D) An improper attempt to support West's credibility. 

\section{Question 14}

Buyer, a retail seller of lawn and garden equipment, entered into a written contract with Seller, a manufacturer of wheelbarrows. The terms of the contract call for Seller to deliver 100 fifteen-pound capacity, red wheelbarrows to Buyer by March 1. On February 28, Buyer received from Seller 90 fifteen-pound capacity, red wheelbarrows and 10 twenty-pound capacity, red wheelbarrows. A letter accompanying the shipment stated, "We no longer make fifteen-pound capacity wheelbarrows. We are sending the last 90 we have in stock along with 10 twenty-pound capacity wheelbarrows. The twenty-pound capacity were sent as an accommodation to you." Which of the following correctly states the rights of Buyer?

I. Buyer can reject the entire shipment.

II. Buyer can accept the 90 conforming wheelbarrows, reject the 10 nonconforming wheelbarrows, and sue Seller for damages.

III. Buyer can accept the entire shipment and sue Seller for damages.

(A) Only I. and II. are correct.

(B) Only I. is correct.

(C) I., II., and III. are correct.

(D) Only II. is correct.

\section{Question 15}

The German-made Doppelpferd, featuring sleek styling and remarkable fuel efficiency, is the most popular automobile in the United States. Its United States sales are booming, and the average retail markup in such sales is $30 \%$. Hardsell Motors, Inc., a franchised Doppelpferd dealer in the United States, contracted with Shift to sell him a new Doppelpferd for $\$ 9,000$ cash, the sale to be consummated after delivery to Hardsell of the car, which Hardsell ordered from the manufacturer specifically for Shift. The signed retail contractual document was a form drafted by Hardsell's lawyer, and Shift did not question or object to any of its terms, including the price inserted by Hardsell. When the car arrived from Germany, Shift repudiated the contract. Hardsell at once sold the car for $\$ 9,000$ cash to Karbuff, for whom Hardsell had also ordered from the manufacturer a Doppelpferd identical to Shift's.

In an action against Shift for breach of contract, Hardsell will probably recover:
(A) $\$ 9,000$ minus what it cost Hardsell to purchase the car from the manufacturer.
(B) $\$ 9,000$ minus the wholesale price of an identical Doppelpferd in the local whole- sale market among dealers.
(C) Nominal damages only because Hardsell resold the car to Karbuff without lowering the retail price.
(D) Nothing, because the parties' agreement was an adhesion contract and therefore unconscionable. 

\section{Question 16}

Pike sued Digger, the contractor who constructed Pike's house, for breach of warranty of habitability. At trial, in cross-examination of Pike, Digger's attorney asked whether Pike had sued another contractor 30 years earlier, claiming similar defects in another house built for Pike. The question was not objected to and Pike answered that she had had some "water problems" with the first house she ever purchased, but no suit was filed.

Digger then called Wirth, the contractor of 30 years earlier, to testify that Pike had brought suit against Wirth for defects in the earlier house, many of which were like those now claimed to be found in the home Digger built, but that the case was settled without trial.

The trial court should rule Wirth's offered testimony:

(A) Admissible as proper impeachment since Pike will have an opportunity to deny or explain Wirth's statement.

(B) Admissible, because Pike failed to object to Digger's questions on cross-examination relative to the prior suit.

(C) Inadmissible, because the best evidence of the former suit is the court record.

(D) Inadmissible, because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that it will confuse the issues and waste time.

Questions 17-18 are based on the following fact situation:

Hammond decided to kill his wife by poisoning her. He asked his friend, Jordan, a pharmacist, to obtain some curare, a deadly poison, and to give it to him without recording the transaction. Because Jordan suspected Hammond's motive, she supplied Hammond with a small quantity of Marvane, an antibiotic, instead of curare. Marvane is harmless if administered in small quantities, except for the less than $1 \%$ of the population who are allergic to the drug. Hammond injected his wife with the Marvane while she slept. She was allergic to the drug and died from the injection. Jordan was distraught and confessed the entire affair to the police, explaining that she had failed to report Hammond's conduct to the authorities because she feared that it would end their friendship if she did.

17. Jordan is an accomplice to:
(A) Murder.
(B) Manslaughter.
(C) Criminally negligent homicide.
(D) No degree of criminal homicide.

18. In a common law jurisdiction, Hammond is guilty of:
(A) Murder only.
(B) Murder and conspiracy.
(C) Attempted murder only.
(D) Attempted murder and conspiracy. 

\section{Question 19}

Abco developed a new drug, $\mathrm{ZB}$, for treatment of Wegener's disease. Abco extensively tested $\mathrm{ZB}$ for several years on animals and human volunteers and had observed no undesirable side effects. The Federal Drug Administration ("FDA") then approved ZB for sale as a prescription drug.

Five other drug companies, each acting independently, developed drugs identical to $\mathrm{ZB}$. Each of these drugs was also approved by the FDA for sale as a prescription drug. True Blue Drug, a wholesaler, bought identically shaped pills from all six of the manufacturers and sold the pills to drugstores as Wegener's $\mathrm{X}$.

This drug had a long-delayed side effect. Sons of male users of Wegener's $X$ are sterile. One such son, Crane, brought an action against Abco for his damages. Abco, through True Blue Drug, supplied about $10 \%$ of the Wegener's X sold in the state where Crane lived. It is not possible to establish which of the five companies supplied the particular pills that Crane's father took.

If Crane asserts a claim against Abco based on strict liability in tort, which of the following will be a decisive question in determining whether Crane will prevail?

(A) Does the res ipsa loquitur doctrine apply?

(B) Can liability be imposed on Abco without proof that Abco knew that the drug had an undesirable side effect?

(C) Is Abco relieved of liability by the FDA approval of the drug?

(D) Can liability be imposed on Abco without showing that its pills were used by Crane's father?

Questions 20-21 are based on the following fact situation:

Lightpost, Inc., the owner of a retail outlet mall, leased one of its retail units to Shirts by Sam ("Shirts"), a chain selling casual apparel, for a period of five years. The lease agreement provided that Shirts would pay to Lightpost, as additional rent, a share of maintenance costs for the construction and upkeep of the parking lots and other common areas in the mall, and Lightpost would be responsible for maintaining these areas. The maintenance fee was calculated based on total square footage of each unit and amounted to $\$ 1,000$ a month for the unit leased by Shirts. The agreement also permitted assignments and subleases. For four years, Shirts operated its apparel store and paid all rent and maintenance fees. At the end of the fourth year, Shirts properly assigned the lease to Shoes by Sheila ("Shoes"), a discount shoe outlet.

20. Assume for purposes of this question only that, at the time it assigned the lease, Shirts owed \$3,000 in maintenance fees for the last three months of its occupancy, and that Shoes paid its rent but did not pay any maintenance fees to Lightpost for the first six months. Shoes then abandoned the property. Lightpost made reasonable efforts during the last six months of the term to relet the unit but was unable to do so. After applying the security deposit to satisfy the balance of the rent, Lightpost wishes to collect the unpaid maintenance fees during the last 15 months of the lease, totaling $\$ 15,000$. Who is liable for those fees and in what amount?
(A) Shirts and Shoes are jointly and severally liable for the $\$ 15,000$ in fees.
(B) Shirts is solely liable for $\$ 3,000$ in fees, and Shirts and Shoes are jointly and severally liable for $\$ 12,000$ in fees.
(C) Shirts is solely liable for $\$ 3,000$ in fees, Shoes is solely liable for $\$ 6,000$ in fees, and Shirts and Shoes are jointly and severally liable for $\$ 6,000$ in fees.
(D) Shirts is solely liable for $\$ 3,000$ in fees, and Shoes is solely liable for $\$ 12,000$ in fees.

GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE 21. Assume for purposes of this question only that, shortly after Shirts assigned the lease to Shoes, Lightpost sold the mall to Lakeview, Ltd. Lakeview took subject to all of the leases, including Shoes's lease, but did not assume any of Lightpost's obligations under it. Five months after the sale, a contractor originally hired by Lightpost who was reconstructing the parking lot in front of Shoes's store walked off the job because he had not received any progress payments from either Lightpost or Lakeview during the past five months. After notifying Lightpost and Lakeview and receiving no response, Shoes agreed to pay the contractor $\$ 20,000$ up front to finish the job so that the store would have parking for the holiday shopping season. Shoes then withheld its rent payment of $\$ 2,000$ for that month and brought an action against Lightpost and Lakeview to recover the balance of the payment to the contractor. Shoes had paid its maintenance fees in advance for the rest of its term.

Are either Lightpost or Lakeview liable to Shoes?

(A) Neither Lakeview nor Lightpost is liable to Shoes because Shoes is in breach of its covenant to pay rent.

(B) Lightpost is liable to Shoes, but Lakeview is not, because Lakeview did not assume Lightpost's obligations.

(C) Lakeview is liable to Shoes, but Lightpost is not, because the sale by Lightpost to Lakeview severed any privity of estate between Lightpost and Shoes.

(D) Both Lakeview and Lightpost are liable to Shoes because the maintenance duties constitute an independent covenant that is part of the lease and that runs with land.

\section{Question 22}

To secure an express lane on the information superhighway, the federal government contracted with a number of communications utilities to install fiberoptic communication lines between major federal offices across the country. The utilities, which maintained ownership of the lines, contracted with the federal government to install the lines on a "cost plus fixed fee" basis, whereby all installation costs would be reimbursed by the government. One such line was installed in State Yellow's capital city, Plains, where the Department of the Interior maintained its western regional office. State Yellow imposes a tax on the installation of all communication lines in the state, including fiberoptic cable lines. It seeks to impose the tax on the line running to the federal office.

Will the state be permitted to impose the tax?
(A) Yes, because the tax is indirect and nondis- criminatory.
(B) Yes, because the tax is a valid exercise of state power under the Tenth Amendment.
(C) No, because the tax burdens the activities of the federal government.
(D) No, because the activity taxed involves interstate commerce. 

\section{Question 23}

In an action by Patrick against David, one of the issues is whether David is a licensed psychotherapist. Normally, the names of all licensed psychotherapists are registered with the office of the State Department of Professional Registrations. Patrick wishes to introduce a certified document, signed by the chief registrar of the Department, stating that an examination of the Department's rolls does not disclose David's name.

Should the document be admitted?
(A) Yes, because a statement of absence from public record is admissible.
(B) Yes, but only if the chief registrar is un- available.
(C) No, because the document is hearsay not within an exception.
(D) No, because the document is not self- authenticating.

\section{Question 24}

While on a hiking trip during the late fall, Page arrived toward the end of the day at a clearing where several similar cabins were located, none of which was occupied. One of the cabins belonged to Levin, Page's friend, who had given Page permission to use it. Page entered one of the cabins, which she thought was Levin's, and prepared to spend the night. In fact the cabin was owned, not by Levin, but by Dwyer.

When the night turned cold, Page started a fire in the stove. Unknown to Page, there was a defect in the stove that allowed carbon monoxide fumes to escape into the cabin. During the night the fumes caused serious injury to Page.

If Page asserts a claim against Dwyer for her injury, will Page recover?
(A) Yes, if Dwyer knew that the stove was defective.
(B) Yes, if Dwyer could have discovered the defect in the stove by a reasonable inspec- tion.
(C) No, because Dwyer had no reason to anticipate Page's presence in the cabin.
(D) No, unless Page needed to use the cabin for her own protection. 

\section{Question 25}

On a wholly random basis, a state agency has given a few probationary employees who were not rehired at the end of their probationary period a statement of reasons and an opportunity for a hearing; but the agency has very rarely done so. No statute or rule of the agency required such a statement of reasons or a hearing.

The employment of Masters, a probationary employee, was terminated without a statement of reasons or an opportunity for a hearing. The agency did not even consider whether it should give him either.

A suit by Masters requesting a statement of reasons and a hearing will probably be:

(A) Successful, on the grounds that failure to give Masters reasons and an opportunity for a hearing constituted a bill of attainder.

(B) Successful, on the grounds that an agency's inconsistent practices, even if unintentional, deny adversely affected persons the equal protection of the laws.

(C) Unsuccessful, because Masters does not have a right to be rehired that is protected by procedural due process.

(D) Unsuccessful, because the conditions of state employment are matters reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.

\section{Question 26}

Marvin Manufacturing Company was in the business of making copper tubing. Golde Industries telephoned Marvin's sales department and placed an order for 10,000 linear feet of copper tubing at a sale price of $\$ 2$ per foot. The tubing was to be used in the production of a custom order for one of Golde's customers. Marvin installed special equipment for the manufacture of the tubing to Golde's specifications and had completed a portion of the order when Golde again telephoned the sales department. This time, however, Golde canceled its order, saying it no longer had need of the tubing because its customer had been declared bankrupt, and refused to pay for the order.

If Marvin sues for breach, it will:

(A) Win, because the contract is fully enforceable.

(B) Win, because the contract is enforceable to the extent of the portion of the order completed.

(C) Lose, because a contract for the sale of goods over $\$ 500$ must be in writing.

(D) Lose, because the parol evidence rule would preclude testimony about the initial telephone call.

\section{Question 27}

Police investigating a homicide had probable cause to believe that Drake had committed it. They then learned from a reliable informant that, a short while ago, Drake had gone to Trent's house to obtain a false driver's license from Trent, a convicted forger. Believing that Drake might still be there, the police, without obtaining a warrant, went to Trent's house. They entered the house and found Drake hiding in the basement. He was arrested and given his Miranda warnings. At the police station, he confessed to the homicide.

At a preliminary hearing, Drake's attorney contends that the confession should be suppressed on Fourth Amendment grounds.

Is the court likely to agree?

(A) Yes, because the police did not have a search warrant to enter Trent's house and there were no exigent circumstances.

(B) Yes, because the police did not have an arrest warrant for Drake and there were no exigent circumstances.

(C) No, because a reliable informant told police that Drake was in Trent's house.

(D) No, because the police had probable cause to arrest Drake. 

\section{Question 28}

All of the deeds for the lots in the 5100 block of Elm Street contained a restrictive covenant requiring that all houses built on the lots be set back a minimum of 50 feet from the sidewalk. Local zoning regulations required that all homes in the area of the 5100 block of Elm Street be set back a minimum of 35 feet from the sidewalk. Dampier purchased a lot on the 5100 block of Elm Street on which it would be possible to build a home with a 50-foot setback. However, the lot was of an unusual shape, and Dampier applied to the city zoning commission asking for a variance allowing him to build a house set back 30 feet from the sidewalk. In his petition, Dampier cited the unusual shape of the lot and asserted that it would cause hardship for him to build in compliance with the 35-foot setback required by the zoning regulations. The zoning commission granted Dampier the variance. Nora, whose home was located at 5130 Elm Street, noticed surveyors putting up ropes 30 feet from the sidewalk on Dampier's lot, and she discovered that Dampier planned to build a home with only a 30 -foot setback.

Nora seeks to enforce the restrictive covenant and brings suit to enjoin Dampier from building a residence with a setback of less than 50 feet. Who will prevail?

(A) Dampier, because zoning regulations take precedence over restrictive covenants as a matter of public policy.

(B) Dampier, because equity will not impose a hardship.

(C) Nora, because Dampier will be unjustly enriched if he is permitted to build a 30 foot setback.

(D) Nora, because a zoning variance does not affect the enforcement of a restrictive covenant.

Questions 29-30 are based on the following fact situation:

On January 1, Awl and Howser agreed in writing that Awl would build a house on Howser's lot according to Howser's plans and specifications for $\$ 60,000$, the work to commence on April 1. Howser agreed to make an initial payment of $\$ 10,000$ on April 1, and to pay the balance upon completion of the work.

On February 1, Awl notified Howser that he (Awl) would lose money on the job at that price, and would not proceed with the work unless Howser would agree to increase the price to $\$ 90,000$. Howser thereupon, without notifying Awl, agreed in writing with Gutter for Gutter, commencing April 1, to build the house for $\$ 75,000$, which was the fair market cost of the work to be done.

On April 1, both Awl and Gutter showed up at the building site to begin work, Awl telling Howser that he had decided to "take the loss" and would build the house for $\$ 60,000$ as originally agreed. Howser dismissed Awl and allowed Gutter to begin work on the house.

29. In a contract action by Awl against Howser, which of the following would the court decide under the prevailing American view?

(A) Howser will win because Awl in legal effect committed a total breach of contract.

(B) Howser will win because Gutter's contract price was $\$ 15,000$ lower than the $\$ 90,000$ demanded by Awl on February 1.

(C) Awl will win because Howser did not tell him before April 1 about the contract with Gutter.

(D) Awl will win because he attempted to perform the contract as originally agreed. 30. For this question only, assume that Awl is liable to Howser for breach of contract and also assume the following additional facts: Gutter finished the house on schedule and then showed Howser that he (Gutter) had spent $\$ 85,000$ on the job. Howser thereupon paid Gutter the full balance of their contract price plus an additional $\$ 10,000$, so that Gutter would not lose money.

In a contract action by Howser against Awl, Howser will recover:

(A) The difference between the fair market value of the completed house and Awl's original contract price.

(B) \$30,000, the difference between Awl's original contract price and the amount Awl demanded on February 1.

(C) \$25,000, the difference between Awl's original contract price and the total amount Howser paid Gutter for building the house.

(D) $\$ 15,000$, the difference between Awl's original contract price and Gutter's contract price.

\section{Question 31}

Benjamin, a foreign correspondent, wished to purchase Whiteacre. Smith, the owner of Whiteacre, was not yet sure he wished to sell the property. He was waiting to see if his bid on another parcel was going to be accepted. Before Smith could make up his mind, Benjamin was assigned to cover an ethnic conflict in eastern Europe that was escalating into a war. Prior to his departure, Benjamin gave his attorney, Lenora, $\$ 100,000$ and his power of attorney. He instructed Lenora that, should Whiteacre be put up for sale, she was authorized to: offer up to $\$ 100,000$ for it, enter into a binding contract to purchase it on Benjamin's behalf, and if he did not return in time, she was authorized to close on the property. In early January, Smith put Whiteacre on the market. Lenora offered $\$ 75,000$ for it, which Smith readily accepted. On January 15, Lenora, on Benjamin's behalf, entered into a written contract to purchase Whiteacre for $\$ 75,000$. Closing was set for February 15 . During this time, Lenora heard nothing from Benjamin. When he had not returned by the date of closing, Lenora attended the closing and tendered the $\$ 75,000$. Smith tendered a deed made out to Benjamin as the grantee.

On February 20, news was received that Benjamin had been killed by a stray bullet on January 14. Benjamin's will left his entire estate to his niece, Nellie. In the meantime, Smith has had someone offer him $\$ 150,000$ for Whiteacre. Having heard of Benjamin's death, Smith believes the conveyance to Benjamin is invalid. Smith brings a suit to quiet title to Whiteacre.

The court will most likely find that the owner of Whiteacre is:
(A) Nellie, because Lenora held the deed on constructive trust for Benjamin's estate.
(B) Nellie, because of the operation of the doctrine of equitable conversion.
(C) Smith, because a deed to a nonexistent person is void and conveys no title.
(D) Smith, because the risk of loss is on the buyer. 

\section{Question 32}

Patricia sued Doris for injuries suffered when her car collided in an intersection with one driven by Doris. At trial, Patricia testified that she had had the right-of-way over Doris to enter the intersection. Doris did not cross-examine. Patricia then called Wendy to testify that, shortly after the collision, as she pulled Patricia from the car, Wendy heard Patricia say, "I think I'm dying! Didn't the other driver see I had the right-of-way?" Wendy's testimony was admitted over defense counsel's objections. On appeal from a verdict for Patricia, Doris challenges the admission of Wendy's testimony.

Should the trial court's ruling be upheld?
(A) Yes, because Patricia's statement was made under belief of impending death.
(B) Yes, because Patricia's statement was an excited utterance.
(C) No, because Patricia's credibility had not been attacked.
(D) No, because Patricia's belief that she had the right-of-way had already been estab- lished without contradiction.

\section{Question 33}

There is high and persistent unemployment in the industrialized state of Green. Its legislature therefore enacted a statute requiring every business with annual sales in Green of over $\$ 1$ million to purchase each year goods and/or services in Green equal in value to at least half of its sales in Green.

Which of the following parties most clearly has standing to contest the constitutionality of this statute of Green in federal court?

(A) A business in another state that supplies from that other state $95 \%$ of the goods and services bought by a corporation that has annual sales in Green of $\$ 20$ million.

(B) A corporation selling $\$ 300,000$ worth of goods in Green but presently purchasing only $\$ 10,000$ in goods and services in Green. (C) The governor of an adjacent state on behalf of the state and its residents.

(D) The owner of high-grade, secured bonds issued by a corporation with sales in Green of $\$ 10$ million that currently purchases only $\$ 1$ million in goods and services in Green.

Questions 34-35 are based on the following fact situation:

Jaywalking (crossing a street outside of a crosswalk or not at an intersection) is punishable by a fine in Metropolis. Bert, who had lived in Metropolis all of his 67 years, was out windowshopping with his wife, Ruth, also 67 , when he saw a friend across the street at a diner they both frequented. Telling Ruth that he would be right back, he saw that there were no cars nearby and so strode briskly across the street in the middle of the block. As he reached the other sidewalk, a police officer who had been checking parked cars for parking violations stepped up to Bert and said, "Hold it buddy, let's see your driver's license," and then reached for her citation book. Bert, a city dweller from birth, had always walked or used public transportation, had never learned to drive, and did not have a driver's license. When he told the officer that he did not have a driver's license, she said, "All right, I'm taking you in," and seized his wrist, twisting it up and behind him in a personnel control lock. A black belt in judo, Bert easily slipped the officer's grasp. "You asked for it," she then growled, and pulled her baton from her belt. When she attempted to strike Bert, he moved swiftly to the side, chopped at her arm, and caused the baton to fall from her grasp to the pavement. At that point two other officers arrived on the scene and arrested Bert. Ruth watched the entire episode from across the street and became greatly distressed. 34. Bert brings an action against the first officer for battery. What will be the probable outcome of this litigation?
(A) He will lose, because he struck the officer.
(B) He will lose, because the offense was committed in the officer's presence.
(C) He will win, unless he is found guilty of jaywalking.
(D) He will win, because the officer was not privileged to arrest him.

35. Ruth also sues the officer, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress. Will she recover?
(A) No, unless the officer knew that Ruth and Bert were husband and wife.
(B) No, if the officer did not know that Ruth was watching from across the street.
(C) Yes, because the officer's conduct regarding Bert was extreme and outrageous.
(D) Yes, because the officer's conduct caused Ruth to be severely emotion- ally disturbed.

Questions 36-37 are based on the following fact situation:

One night after work, Dunken stopped in at a bar next to his place of employment to have a few drinks before heading home. While there, he became intoxicated. Upon leaving the bar, Dunken decided that he would drive home rather than walk. Dunken went next door to a used car lot to take a car to drive home. However, Dunken discovered that there were no keys in any of the cars. He then broke into the main office of the used car lot where he surmised correctly that the keys would be kept. As he left the office with keys to one of the cars, Dunken saw a security guard coming toward him. Dunken pushed the guard to the side as he ran past. The guard fell back, hit his head on the pavement, and died. Dunken then climbed into the car and drove away. On his way home, he was so intoxicated that he missed his exit. Making an illegal u-turn to go back, he struck a car legally parked on the side of the road, killing its occupant. Relevant statutes extend burglary to include buildings not used as a dwelling. First degree murder is defined as "the premeditated and intentional killing of another or a killing during commission of a rape, robbery, burglary, or arson." Second degree murder is defined as all murders that are not first degree murder.

36. If Dunken is charged with first degree murder for the death of the security guard, the court should charge the jury on the issue of the defense of intoxication that:
(A) Voluntary intoxication is no defense to the crime of first degree murder as defined by the statute.
(B) Voluntary intoxication is a defense to the crime of first degree murder if Dunken would not have killed the security guard but for the intoxication.
(C) Voluntary intoxication is a defense to the crime of first degree murder if it prevented Dunken from forming the intent to commit a burglary.
(D) Voluntary intoxication is a defense to first degree murder if it prevented Dunken from forming the intent to kill the security guard. 37. If Dunken is charged with homicide for the death of the occupant of the parked car, the most serious crime for which Dunken can be convicted is:
(A) First degree murder.
(B) Second degree murder.
(C) Involuntary manslaughter based on criminal negligence.
(D) Involuntary manslaughter based on unlawful conduct.

\section{Question 38}

The High National Grasslands is owned by the United States and is located in the center of a large western state. Acting pursuant to a federal statute authorizing such action, the United States Bureau of Land Management leased the grazing rights in the High National Grasslands to ranchers located nearby. Grazingland Company owns a vast amount of rangeland adjacent to the High National Grasslands and leases its land for livestock grazing purposes to the same ranchers, but at prices higher than those charged by the Bureau. Grazingland Company sued the Bureau in an appropriate federal district court to restrain the Bureau from competing with that company by leasing the High National Grasslands.

Which of the following constitutional provisions may most easily and directly be used to justify the federal statute authorizing this leasing program of the Bureau of Land Management?
(A) The General Welfare Clause of Article I, Section 8.
(B) The Federal Property Clause of Article IV, Section 3.
(C) The Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8.
(D) The Supremacy Clause of Article VI.

\section{Question 39}

In Peck's antitrust suit against manufacturers of insulation, Peck's interrogatories asked for information concerning total sales of insulation by each of the defendant manufacturers in a particular year. The defendants replied to the interrogatories by referring Peck to the Insulation Manufacturer's Annual Journal for the information.

If, at trial, Peck offers the annual as evidence of the sales volume, this evidence is:
(A) Admissible, as an adoptive admission of the defendants.
(B) Admissible, as a business record.
(C) Inadmissible, as hearsay not within any exception.
(D) Inadmissible, as lacking sufficient authenti- cation. 

\section{Question 40}

Farmer's Garden Foods ("FGF") was a manufacturer of quality red cheese made from imported yaks' milk. In a written agreement between FGF and Gourmet Mart ("GM"), a retail seller of fine quality foods, FGF agreed to "sell all output of FGF red cheese to GM," and GM agreed to "sell FGF red cheese exclusively." The agreement went on to state that GM would pay $\$ 150$ for each 10 -wheel container of red cheese ordered from FGF.

Under the above facts, what are the relative obligations of the parties?

(A) FGF has to sell all of its output to GM; GM has to buy all of FGF's output.

(B) FGF has to sell all of its output to GM; GM has to sell exclusively FGF red cheese.

(C) FGF has to sell all of its output to GM; GM has to sell exclusively FGF red cheese but it does not have to buy any.

(D) FGF has to sell all of its output to GM; GM has to buy all of FGF's output and has to sell exclusively FGF red cheese.

\section{Question 41}

Constance owned Greenacre in fee simple. She executed two instruments in the proper form of deeds. The first instrument purported to convey an undivided one-half interest in Greenacre to Henry and his wife, Audrey, as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The second instrument purported to convey an undivided one-half interest in Greenacre to Susan, the only child of Henry. Susan was 13 years old at the time. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. No actual consideration was paid for the deeds. Constance handed the two deeds to Henry. Henry promptly and properly recorded the deed to himself and Audrey and put the deed to his daughter, Susan, in a safe-deposit box without recording it.

The same year, Henry, Audrey, and Susan were on a vacation when the plane in which they were flying went down, and all three were killed simultaneously. Henry, Audrey, and Susan died intestate. The applicable statute in the jurisdictions provides that "when title to property on its devolution depends on priority of death and there is insufficient evidence that the persons have died otherwise than simultaneously, the property of each person shall be disposed of as if he had survived." An appropriate action was instituted by the heirs of Henry, Audrey, and Susan. Constance, who is not an heir of any of the deceased, was a party to the action.

The court should determine that title to Greenacre is:
(A) Entirely in Constance.
(B) One-half in the heirs of Henry and one-half in the heirs of Audrey.
(C) One-half in Constance, one-quarter in the heirs of Henry, and one-quarter in the heirs of Audrey.
(D) One-half in the heirs of Susan, one-quarter in the heirs of Henry, and one-quarter in the heirs of Audrey. 

\section{Question 42}

Argus Corporation is privately owned and incorporated in the state of Kiowa. It contracted with the United States to construct a dam across the Big Sandy River in the state of Arapahoe. The state of Arapahoe imposed a gross receipts tax on all business conducted within the state. Arapahoe sued Argus Corporation to collect that tax on the receipts Argus received under this federal contract. No federal statutes or administrative rules are applicable, and the contract between the United States and the Argus Corporation does not mention state taxation.

The court should hold the state tax, as applied here, to be:

(A) Constitutional, because a state has exclusive jurisdiction over all commercial transactions executed wholly within its borders.

(B) Constitutional, because private contractors performing work under a federal contract are not immune in these circumstances from nondiscriminatory state taxation.

(C) Unconstitutional, because it violates the Supremacy Clause.

(D) Unconstitutional, because it imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce.

\section{Question 43}

Able, an attorney, sued Clinton, a client, for his fee, based on an agreed hourly rate. Clinton subpoenaed the attorney's time records for the days on which he purported to have worked for Clinton to show that Able had billed an impossible number of hours to Clinton and others on those days. Clinton's subpoena provided that any information concerning the matters handled for other clients be deleted or masked. Able moved to quash the subpoena on the ground of attorney-client privilege. The subpoena should be:

(A) Upheld, because the information about hours billed is not within the privilege.

(B) Upheld, because an attorney has no right to invoke his client's privilege without instructions from the client.

(C) Quashed, because an attorney is entitled to a right of privacy for the work product in his files.

(D) Quashed, because no permission was obtained from the other clients to divulge information from their files.

Questions 44-45 are based on the following fact situation:

Torgeson, a prosperous widower, owned Fruitacre, a large tract of land located near Sunbelt City. Fruitacre was primarily used for extensive citrus orchards, but Torgeson was sure that rapidly growing Sunbelt City would expand toward Fruitacre, and that Fruitacre would be a prime tract for a residential subdivision within 20 years. Torgeson wanted to see his three grandchildren, Hubert (age 22), Dubert (age 17), and Luberta (age 15), benefit from the large price that he was sure Fruitacre would bring, but he was also concerned that the grandchildren be of sufficient maturity. Torgeson suggested to his only child, Diana, that he give her a life interest in Fruitacre, and that Diana's children take Fruitacre upon her death. Diana told Torgeson that she did not need the income from Fruitacre and would prefer that Torgeson give the land directly to Hubert, Dubert, and Luberta. Torgeson arrived at what he felt was a reasonable compromise, using his good friend, Fran (age 55), as the person to whom he conveyed the land. Torgeson's conveyance read, in pertinent part, as follows: "I convey Fruitacre to Fran for life, remainder to all of my grandchildren who ever attain the age of 25 , and if none of them attains such age, to the Sisters of Charity." 44. The grandchildren's interest can best be described as:
(A) A contingent remainder.
(B) A vested remainder.
(C) An executory interest.
(D) Nothing.

45. The Sisters of Charity's interest can best be described as:
(A) A contingent remainder.
(B) A vested remainder subject to total divestment.
(C) An executory interest.
(D) Nothing.

Questions 46-47 are based on the following fact situation:

Until 1954, the state of New Atlantic required segregation in all public and private schools, but all public schools are now desegregated. Other state laws, enacted before 1954 and continuing to the present, provide for free distribution of the same textbooks on secular subjects to students in all public and private schools. In addition, the state accredits schools and certifies teachers.

Little White School House, a private school that offers elementary and secondary education in the state, denies admission to all non-Caucasians. Stone School is a private school that offers religious instruction. 46. Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of free distribution of textbooks to the students at the Little White School House?

(A) No legitimate educational function is served by the free distribution of textbooks.

(B) The state may not in any way aid private schools.

(C) The Constitution forbids private bias of any kind.

(D) Segregation is furthered by the distribution of textbooks to these students.

47. Which of the following is the strongest argument in favor of the constitutionality of free distribution of textbooks to the students at Stone School?

(A) Private religious schools, like public nonsectarian schools, fulfill an important educational function.

(B) Religious instruction in private schools is not constitutionally objectionable.

(C) The purpose and effect of the free distribution of these textbooks is secular and does not entangle church and state.

(D) The Free Exercise Clause requires identical treatment by the state of students in public and private schools. 

\section{Question 48}

Edgar was employed as an electrician by Edgewater Electric Services. Edgewater had contracts with a number of large office and condominium buildings to provide emergency electrical services and repairs at any hour of the day or night. Edgewater also advertised in the telephone "yellow pages": "If it's an electrical emergency, call Edgewater Electric Servicesnight or day."' Although Edgar usually worked from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Edgewater, the nature of Edgewater's emergency services required Edgar to be "on call" 24 hours a day. Therefore, Edgewater required Edgar to drive his company van to his home each night, so he would be in a position to speed off to an emergency with all of his tools and equipment at hand. One afternoon, Edgar left the Edgewater Electric offices at 4 p.m. as usual. However, when he left the main highway, he did not turn left toward his home but instead turned right toward the supermarket a few blocks away to pick up some items for dinner. While leaving the supermarket parking lot, Edgar drove negligently and struck Parka, a pedestrian. Parka suffered serious injuries and required several operations and a lengthy hospital stay. Parka filed suit against Edgewater for $\$ 100,000$.

Is Parka likely to recover from Edgewater?

(A) Yes, because Edgar's trip to the market was only a slight deviation from the direct route to his home.

(B) Yes, but only if Edgewater knew that Edgar had proclivities to drive negligently.

(C) No, because turning in the opposite direction from his home constituted a "frolic" by Edgar.

(D) No, because an employer is not liable for the torts of an employee traveling to and from work.

\section{Question 49}

Smythe was charged with the murder of his wife. In his defense, he testified that, at the time he killed her, he believed that his wife was planning to destroy the world by detonating a massive explosive device that she had developed and built in the basement of their home. He further testified that he had tried many times to dissuade his wife from her plan and had tried to destroy devices that she stored in the basement. She had, he testified, foiled his efforts by, on two occasions, signing papers for his hospitalization, which lasted for a brief period each time. He said that he had concluded that the only way to prevent her scheme was to kill her and that he had become so obsessed with the importance of doing so that he could think of nothing else. One day when he saw her open the door to the basement, he lunged at her and pushed her down the steps to her death.

The best defense raised by Smythe's testimony is:
(A) Lack of the requisite mental element.
(B) Lack of the requisite act element.
(C) Insanity.
(D) Belief that the situation justified his ac- tions. 

\section{Question 50}

Scholastica, the Academic Dean at Woodbine College, was well liked and considered a competent scholar and a fine teacher. However, six months after her appointment as Dean, Scholastica received a certified letter from Rector, the Provost of Woodbine College, summarily dismissing her. No reasons were given in the letter for Scholastica's dismissal. Scholastica had her lawyer, Loretta, contact Rector to discover the basis of her dismissal, if possible. Two days later, Loretta received a letter from Rector stating, in relevant part, "Scholastica was dismissed from her employment at Woodbine College because I received an anonymous telephone call informing me that Scholastica was involved in selling drugs to students. One can't be too careful about these things in this day and age." Rector had, in fact, received such a phone call, but the basis of the statement was untrue, because Scholastica had never even used illegal drugs, much less sold them.

If Scholastica files suit against Rector for libel:

(A) Scholastica will win, if Rector should have verified the anonymous statement before repeating it to Loretta.

(B) Scholastica will lose, because by having her attorney ask the reason for the dismissal, Scholastica impliedly consented to the statement in the letter.

(C) Rector will win, because Rector was merely repeating the defamatory communication of another.

(D) Rector will lose, because Scholastica was not dealing in drugs.

\section{Question 51}

Rose was convicted in federal court of possession of one kilogram of heroin with intent to distribute. She was sentenced to a prison term. Subsequently, Rose was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same kilogram of heroin. She moved to dismiss the indictment.

Her motion should be:

(A) Denied, because the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply when the second prosecution is for violation of a separate statute.

(B) Denied, because each prosecution requires proof of an element that the other does not.

(C) Granted, because the Double Jeopardy Clause protects her against a second prosecution for the same criminal conduct.

(D) Granted, because the Due Process Clause protects her against double punishment for the same criminal conduct.

Questions 52-53 are based on the following fact situation:

Three states, East Winnetka, Midland, and West Hampton, are located next to one another in that order. The states of East Winnetka and West Hampton permit the hunting and trapping of snipe, but the state of Midland strictly forbids it in order to protect snipe, a rare species of animal, from extinction. The state of Midland has a state statute that provides, "Possession of snipe traps is prohibited. Any game warden finding a snipe trap within the state shall seize and destroy it." Snipe traps cost about $\$ 15$ each. Prentis is a resident of West Hampton and an ardent snipe trapper. She drove her car to East Winnetka to purchase a new improved snipe trap from a manufacturer there. In the course of her trip back across Midland with the trap in her car, Prentis stopped in a Midland state park to camp for a few nights. While she was in that park, a Midland game warden saw the trap, which was visible on the front seat of her car. The warden seized the trap and destroyed it in accordance with the Midland statute after Prentis admitted that the seized item was a prohibited snipe trap. No federal statutes or federal administrative regulations apply.

52. For this question only, assume that Prentis demonstrates that common carriers are permitted to transport snipe traps as cargo across Midland for delivery to another state and that, in practice, the Midland statute is enforced only against private individuals transporting those traps in private vehicles. If Prentis challenges the application of the Midland statute to her on the basis only of a denial of equal protection, this application of the statute will probably be found:

(A) Constitutional, because the traps constitute contraband in which Prentis could have no protected property interest.

(B) Constitutional, because there is a rational basis for differentiating between the possession of snipe traps as interstate cargo by common carriers and the possession of snipe traps by private individuals.

(C) Unconstitutional, because the state cannot demonstrate a compelling public purpose for making this differentiation between common carriers and such private individuals.

(D) Unconstitutional, because interstate travel is a fundamental right that may not be burdened by state law.

53. For this question only, assume that a valid federal administrative rule, adopted under a federal consumer product safety act, regulates the design of snipe traps. The rule was issued to prevent traps from causing injury to human beings, e.g., by pinching fingers while persons were setting the traps. No other federal law applies. Which of the following best states the effect of the federal rule on the Midland state statute?

(A) The federal rule preempts the Midland state statute, because the federal rule regulates the same subject mattersnipe traps.

(B) The federal rule preempts the Midland state statute, because the federal rule does not contain affirmative authorization for continued state regulation.

(C) The federal rule does not preempt the Midland state statute, because the Midland state statute regulates wild animals, a field of exclusive state power.

(D) The federal rule does not preempt the Midland state statute, because the purposes of the federal rule and the Midland state statute are different.

\section{Question 54}

Dryden is tried on a charge of driving while intoxicated. When Dryden was booked at the police station, a videotape was made that showed him unsteady, abusive, and speaking in a slurred manner. If the prosecutor lays a foundation properly identifying the tape, should the court admit it in evidence and permit it to be shown to the jury?
(A) Yes, because it is an admission.
(B) Yes, because its value is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.
(C) No, because the privilege against self- incrimination is applicable.
(D) No, because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence. 

\section{Question 55}

Simmons and Boyd entered into a written contract for the sale and purchase of Wideacre. The contract provided that "Simmons agrees to convey a good and marketable title to Boyd 60 days from the date of this contract."' The purchase price was stated as $\$ 60,000$.

At the time set for closing, Simmons tendered a deed in the form agreed to in the contract. Boyd's examination of the record prior to the date of closing had disclosed, however, that the owner of record was not Simmons, but Olson. Further investigation by Boyd revealed that, notwithstanding the state of the record, Simmons had been in what Boyd concedes is adverse possession for 15 years. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. Boyd refuses to pay the purchase price or to take possession "because of the inability of Simmons to transfer a marketable title."

In an appropriate action by Simmons against Boyd for specific performance, Simmons will:

(A) Prevail, because he has obtained a "good and marketable title" by adverse possession.

(B) Prevail, because Simmons's action for specific performance is an action in rem even though Olson is not a party.

(C) Not prevail, because Boyd cannot be required to buy a lawsuit even if the probability is great that Boyd would prevail against Olson.

(D) Not prevail, because Simmons's failure to disclose his lack of record title constitutes fraud.

\section{Question 56}

Jane, an architectural historian, bought a house in 1979 from William. She paid him $\$ 50,000$ in cash, and the balance of the $\$ 150,000$ sale price came from the proceeds of a mortgage she took out with State National Bank. The mortgage was recorded.

In 1987, Jane borrowed $\$ 5,000$ from the Home Finance Company, using her house as security. Home Finance recorded its mortgage on the property.

In 1996, Jane had an architect friend design an addition to her house. She borrowed $\$ 40,000$ from Property Equity Lenders, Inc. to pay for this construction. Property Equity did not record the mortgage Jane gave it to secure this debt.

In 2003, Jane lost her job and was unable to make payments on some of her obligations. She made the payments on the State National mortgage, but was unable to make any payments on either the Home Finance or Property Equity Lenders mortgages. Home Finance filed foreclosure of its mortgage.

At the foreclosure sale, Susan bought the property. After acquiring the property at the sale, what is Susan's obligation toward the holders of the other two mortgages, State National Bank and Property Equity Lenders, Inc.?
(A) She takes the property subject to both mortgages.
(B) She takes the property subject to neither mortgage.
(C) She takes the property subject to Property Equity Lenders's mortgage, but not subject to State National Bank's mortgage.
(D) She takes the property subject to State National Bank's mortgage, but not subject to Property Equity Lenders's mortgage. Questions 57-58 are based on the following fact situation:

Alpha and Beta made a written contract pursuant to which Alpha promised to convey a specified apartment house to Beta in return for Beta's promise (1) to convey a 100 -acre farm to Alpha and (2) to pay Alpha $\$ 1,000$ in cash six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm. The contract contained the following provision: "It is understood and agreed that Beta's obligation to pay the $\$ 1,000$ six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if Alpha has not, within three months after the aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of the said apartment house."

57. Which of the following statements concerning the order of performances is least accurate?

(A) Alpha's tendering of good title to the apartment house is a condition precedent to Beta's duty to convey good title to the farm.

(B) Beta's tendering of good title to the farm is a condition precedent to Alpha's duty to convey good title to the apartment house.

(C) Beta's tendering of good title to the farm is a condition subsequent to Alpha's duty to convey good title to the apartment house.

(D) Alpha's tendering of good title to the apartment house and Beta's tendering of good title to the farm are concurrent conditions. 58. Alpha's removal of the shed from the parking area of the apartment house is:
(A) A condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to Beta's duty to pay the $\$ 1,000$.
(B) A condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to Beta's duty to pay the $\$ 1,000$.
(C) A condition subsequent to Beta's duty to pay the $\$ 1,000$.
(D) Not a condition, either precedent or subsequent, to Beta's duty to pay the $\$ 1,000$. 

\section{Question 59}

Cantebury Trails operated a fleet of touring buses. It owned its own garage for repairing and maintaining its fleet. Behind this garage was a large vacant lot in which Cantebury Trails stored old, discarded, and wrecked buses, which it salvaged for parts or sold for scrap. This area was fenced in by a five-foot high chain link fence, but Cantebury was aware that children from the neighborhood would climb the fence and play among the junked buses. Consequently, Cantebury Trails would have one of its employees walk through the storage area sometime during the day to chase away any children who may have scaled the fence.

One Saturday afternoon, when Cantebury Trails' garage had closed for the weekend, a group of children climbed over the storage area's fence to play army among the junked buses. One of the children, Donny (who had been chased away from the lot before and who also had been warned by his parents not to play in these buses), was trying to climb on the roof of one of the old buses, when he slipped on the front bumper of the bus and his arm broke through the front windshield. As a result of this accident, Donny severed the tendon and nerves in his right arm, leaving it permanently disabled.

Through an appropriate guardian, Donny brought suit against Cantebury Trails for his injury.

Which of the following, if established, would most aid Donny in showing that Cantebury Trails breached a duty owing to him?

(A) It would have been economically feasible to remove the windows from all the abandoned buses. (B) This area would be classified more as a residential neighborhood than an industrial area.

(C) Cantebury Trails could have eliminated the risk of injury without unduly interfering with its normal operations.

(D) Cantebury Trails improperly maintained the fence that surrounded the lot with the discarded and abandoned buses.

\section{Question 60}

Cars driven by Pugh and Davidson collided, and Davidson was charged with driving while intoxicated in connection with the accident. She pleaded guilty and was merely fined, although, under the statute, the court could have sentenced her to two years in prison.

Thereafter, Pugh, alleging that Davidson's intoxication had caused the collision, sued Davidson for damages. At trial, Pugh offers the properly authenticated record of Davidson's conviction.

The record should be:
(A) Admitted as proof of Davidson's character.
(B) Admitted as proof of Davidson's intoxica- tion.
(C) Excluded, because the conviction was not the result of a trial.
(D) Excluded, because it is hearsay not within any exception. 

\section{Question 61}

In which of the following situations is Defendant least likely to be guilty of burglary in a jurisdiction that has extended burglary to buildings other than dwellings but otherwise retains the common law requirements?

(A) Defendant posed as a member of a cleaning crew so that a security guard would give him access to a department store after it was closed for the night, and then hid in a storage closet until the cleaning crew left. He then stole a quantity of jewelry from several jewelry cases, and forced open a loading dock door to escape from the building.

(B) Defendant, intending to steal money and valuables from a house he believed was unoccupied for the evening, pushed open a mail slot and reached his hand in to try to unlock the front door. The owners' dog bit Defendant's hand and he immediately pulled it out and fled.

(C) Defendant was owed $\$ 500$ by Victor, his bookie. While Victor was out of town one night, Defendant went to Victor's house to get his money, because he knew that Victor had $\$ 500$ in cash in a desk drawer and the debt was long overdue. Defendant opened an unlocked window and entered the house. He could not find the cash, so he decided to take a painting that he knew was worth substantially more than $\$ 500$. He later sold it for $\$ 1,000$ and kept the proceeds.

(D) Defendant, a security officer in a housing project, saw Von, who was wanted on a warrant for drug dealing, through a window of an apartment one evening. He fired his gun at Von from the sidewalk, intending to injure him, although Defendant knew that he was not legally authorized to use deadly force in that situation. The bullet went through the window and missed Von, lodging in a wall behind him.

\section{Question 62}

Pitt sued Dow for damages for injuries that Pitt incurred when a badly rotted limb fell from a curbside tree in front of Dow's home and hit Pitt. Dow claimed that the tree was on city property and thus was the responsibility of the city. At trial, Pitt offered testimony that, a week after the accident, Dow had cut the tree down with a chainsaw.

The offered evidence is:
(A) Inadmissible, because there is a policy to encourage safety precautions.
(B) Inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to the condition of the tree at the time of the accident.
(C) Admissible to show the tree was on Dow's property.
(D) Admissible to show the tree was in a rotted condition. 

\section{Question 63}

Talbot and Rogers, as lessees, signed a valid lease for a house. Lane, the landlord, duly executed the lease and delivered possession of the premises to the lessees.

During the term of the lease, Rogers verbally invited Andrews to share the house with the lessees. Andrews agreed to pay part of the rent to Lane, who did not object to this arrangement, despite a provision in the lease that provided that "any assignment, subletting or transfer of any rights under this lease without the express written consent of the landlord is strictly prohibited, null and void." Talbot objected to Andrews's moving in, even if Andrews were to pay a part of the rent.

When Andrews moved in, Talbot brought an appropriate action against Lane, Rogers, and Andrews for a declaratory judgment that Rogers had no right to assign. Rogers's defense was that he and Talbot were tenants in common of a term for years, and that he, Rogers, had a right to assign a fractional interest in his undivided onehalf interest.

In this action, Talbot will:

(A) Prevail, because a co-tenant has no right to assign all or any part of a leasehold without the consent of all interested parties.

(B) Prevail, because the lease provision prohibits assignment.

(C) Not prevail, because he is not the beneficiary of the nonassignment provision in the lease.

(D) Not prevail, because his claim amounts to a void restraint on alienation.

\section{Question 64}

John Smith has denied his purported signature on a letter that has become critical in a breach of contract suit between Smith and Miller. At trial, Miller's counsel calls Alice, a teacher, who testifies that she taught John Smith mathematics in school 10 years earlier, knows his signature, and proposes to testify that the signature to the letter is that of John Smith. Smith's counsel objects.

The trial judge should:

(A) Sustain the objection on the ground that identification of handwriting requires expert testimony and the teacher does not, per se, qualify as an expert.

(B) Sustain the objection on the ground that the best evidence of Smith's handwriting would be testimony by a person who had examined his writing more recently than 10 years ago.

(C) Overrule the objection on the ground that a schoolteacher qualifies as an expert witness for the purpose of identifying handwriting.

(D) Overrule the objection on the ground that a layman may identify handwriting if he has seen the person in question write, and has an opinion concerning the writing in question. 

\section{Question 65}

Harold and Wanda, once married to each other, had gone through a bitter divorce. The divorce decree awarded custody of the couple's four-year-old son Jake to Wanda, with Harold receiving visitation rights. On the first opportunity that Harold had to take Jake for the weekend, Harold disappeared with Jake. Wanda was greatly distressed and called Harold's parents, Grandmaw and Grandpaw, on a weekly basis, always asking if they knew anything about the whereabouts of Harold and Jake. Grandmaw and Grandpaw knew quite well where Harold and Jake were, and they often sent money to help support Harold while he was on the run. However, they always insisted that they knew nothing about the child. Four years after Jake was abducted, the police arrested Harold and returned Jake to his mother.

Wanda files an action against Grandmaw and Grandpaw alleging infliction of emotional distress. Will Wanda prevail?

(A) Yes, because Grandmaw and Grandpaw acted in deliberate disregard of a high probability that their actions would cause Wanda to suffer emotional distress.

(B) Yes, but only if Grandmaw and Grandpaw actually knew that their actions would cause Wanda to suffer emotional distress.

(C) No, unless Wanda can prove that she suffered physical harm.

(D) No, because Wanda never was in a zone of danger.

Questions 66-68 are based on the following fact situation:

As part of a comprehensive federal aid-toeducation program, Congress included the following provisions as conditions for state receipt of federal funds: (1) Whenever textbooks are provided to students without charge, they must include no religious instruction and must be made available on the same terms to students in all public and private schools accredited by the state educational authority. (2) Salary supplements can be paid to teachers in public and private schools, up to $10 \%$ of existing salary schedules, where present compensation is less than the average salary for persons of comparable training and experience, provided that no such supplement is paid to any teacher who instructs in religious subjects. (3) Construction grants can be made toward the cost of physical plants at private colleges and universities, provided that no part of the grant is used for buildings in which instruction in religious subject matters is offered.

66. Federal taxpayer Allen challenges the provision that allows the distribution of free textbooks to students in a private school where religious instruction is included in the curriculum. On the question of the adequacy of Allen's standing to raise the constitutional question, the most likely result is that standing will be:

(A) Sustained, because any congressional spending authorization can be challenged by any taxpayer.

(B) Sustained, because the challenge to the exercise of congressional spending power is based on a claimed violation of specific constitutional limitations on the exercise of such power.

(C) Denied, because there is insufficient nexus between the taxpayer and the challenged expenditures.

(D) Denied, because, in the case of private schools, no state action is involved. 67. Federal taxpayer Bates also challenges the salary supplements for teachers in private schools where religious instruction is included in the curriculum. On the substantive constitutional issue, the most likely result is that the salary supplements will be:

(A) Sustained, because the statute provides that no supplements will be made to teachers who are engaged in any religious instruction.

(B) Sustained, because to distinguish between private and public school teachers would violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.

(C) Held unconstitutional, because some religions would benefit disproportionately.

(D) Held unconstitutional, because the policing of the restriction would amount to an excessive entanglement with religion.

68. Federal taxpayer Bates also challenges the construction grants to church-operated private colleges and universities. The most likely result is that the construction grants will be:

(A) Sustained, because aid to one aspect of an institution of higher education not shown to be pervasively sectarian does not necessarily free it to spend its other resources for religious purposes.

(B) Sustained, because bricks and mortar do not aid religion in a way forbidden by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

(C) Held unconstitutional, because any financial aid to a church-operated school strengthens the religious purposes of the institution.

(D) Held unconstitutional, because the grants involve or cause an excessive entanglement with religion. Questions 69-70 are based on the following fact situation:

Eureka, Inc., inventor of the LBVC, a laserbeam vegetable chopper, ran a television ad that described the chopper and said, "The LBVC is yours for only $\$ 49.99$ if you send your check or money order to Box 007, Greenville. Not available in stores." Gourmet, who owned a retail specialty shop, wrote Eureka, "What's your best, firm price for two dozen LBVCs?" Eureka sent a written reply that said in its entirety, "We quote you for prompt acceptance $\$ 39.99$ per unit for 24 LBVCs." Gourmet subsequently mailed a check to Eureka in the appropriate amount, with a memo enclosed saying, "I accept your offer for 24 LBVCs."

69. A contract would arise from these communications only if:

(A) Both parties were merchants.

(B) Eureka had at least 24 LBVCs in stock when Gourmet's check and memo were received.

(C) Gourmet's check and memo were mailed within three months after his receipt of Eureka's letter.

(D) Gourmet's check and memo were mailed within a reasonable time after his receipt of Eureka's letter. 70. For this question only, assume the following facts: Eureka shipped 24 LBVCs to Gourmet after receiving his check and memo, and with the shipment sent Gourmet an invoice that conspicuously stated, among other things, the following lawful provision: "These items shall not be offered for resale at retail." Gourmet received and read, but disregarded, the invoice restriction and displayed the 24 LBVCs for resale. Eureka has a cause of action against Gourmet for breach of contract only if:

(A) Eureka, as inventor of the LBVC, was not a merchant.

(B) The invoice restriction was a material alteration of preexisting terms.

(C) Eureka's written reply that quoted $\$ 39.99$ per LBVC, but did not contain a restriction on retail sales, was not an offer that Gourmet accepted by ordering 24 LBVCs.

(D) Gourmet was consciously aware when taking delivery of the goods that the television ad had said, "Not available in stores."

\section{Question 71}

Which of the following is most likely to be found to be a strict liability offense?
(A) A city ordinance providing for a fine of not more than $\$ 200$ for shoplifting.
(B) A federal statute making it a felony to possess heroin.
(C) A state statute making it a felony to fail to register a firearm.
(D) A state statute making the sale of adulter- ated milk a misdemeanor.

\section{Question 72}

A group of children, ranging in age from 8 to 15 , regularly played football on the common area of an apartment complex owned by O'Neill. Most of the children lived in the apartment complex, but some lived elsewhere. O'Neill knew that the children played on the common area and had not objected.

Peter, a 13-year-old who did not live in the apartment complex, fell over a sprinkler head while running for a pass and broke his leg. Although Peter had played football on the common area before, he had never noticed the sprinkler heads, which protruded one inch above the ground and were part of a permanently installed underground sprinkler system.

If a claim is asserted on Peter's behalf, Peter will:

(A) Prevail, if the sprinkler head was a hazard that Peter probably would not discover.

(B) Prevail, because O'Neill had not objected to children playing on the common area.

(C) Not prevail, because Peter did not live in the apartment complex.

(D) Not prevail, unless the sprinkler heads were abnormally dangerous to users of the common area. 

\section{Question 73}

A state statute provides that persons moving into a community to attend a college on a fulltime basis may not vote in any elections for local or state officials that are held in that community. Instead, the statute provides that for voting purposes all such persons shall retain their residence in the community from which they came. In that state the age of majority is 18 .

Which of the following is the strongest argument to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of this state statute?

(A) A state does not have an interest that is sufficiently compelling to justify the exclusion from voting of an entire class of persons.

(B) There are less restrictive means by which the state could assure that only actual residents of a community vote in its elections.

(C) Most persons moving to a community to attend college full-time are likely to have attained the age of majority under the laws of this state.

(D) On its face this statute impermissibly discriminates against interstate commerce.

Questions 74-75 are based on the following fact situation:

Seller and Buyer executed an agreement for the sale of real property.

74. Assume for this question only that Seller dies before closing and his will leaves his personal property to Perry and his real property to Rose. There being no breach of the agreement by either party, which of the following is correct?

(A) Death, an eventuality for which the parties could have provided, terminates the agreement if they did not so provide. (B) Rose is entitled to the proceeds of the sale when it closes, because the doctrine of equitable conversion does not apply to these circumstances.

(C) Perry is entitled to the proceeds of the sale when it closes.

(D) Title was rendered unmarketable by Seller's death.

75. Assume for this question only that Buyer dies before closing, there being no breach of the agreement by either party. Which of the following is appropriate in most jurisdictions?

(A) Buyer's heir may specifically enforce the agreement.

(B) Seller has the right to return the down payment and cancel the contract.

(C) Death terminates the agreement.

(D) Any title acquired would be unmarketable by reason of Buyer's death. 

\section{Question 76}

At trial of Pendergast's battery action against Dellacourt, arising from an incident in which Dellacourt allegedly bit off Pendergast's ear, Winchester testified that he was taking a shortcut through an urban alley one morning and heard someone cry "Help!" Rushing around the corner of a building, Winchester saw Pendergast lying on the sidewalk in a pool of blood, with his left ear missing. Dellacourt, who was standing nearby, turned quickly and made a move as if to approach Winchester, and so Winchester ran down the sidewalk away from Dellacourt to summon the police. The following exchange then occurred during cross-examination of Winchester by Dellacourt's counsel. D: "You didn't actually see my client bite off the plaintiff's ear, did you, Mr. Winchester?" W: "No." D: "For all you know, my client could have been an innocent bystander like yourself, but one who didn't run away but stayed to offer assistance." W: "I ran away because I was afraid of the defendant and because I wanted to call the police." D: "For all we know you might have been running out of that alley because you had just committed a crime yourself, Mr. Winchester." W: "Look, Dellacourt is the one who bit off the ear, not me!" D: "If you arrived on the scene after the alleged ear biting, how can you possibly know my client is the one who bit off the plaintiff's ear?"' W: "Because I read in the newspaper the next day that an eyewitness to the entire event told police that he saw Dellacourt spit the ear out after I left." Dellacourt then moved to have Winchester's last remark stricken from the record.

If the trial court denies Dellacourt's motion, that ruling is most strongly supported by which of the following?
(A) The report of the eyewitness was an excited utterance.
(B) The report of the eyewitness was a state- ment of recent perception.

(C) The error in admitting the statement could not be cured by an appropriate jury instruction.

(D) The remark was invited by the crossexaminer's questions.

Questions 77-78 are based on the following fact situation:

Cycle Company manufactured a bicycle that it sold to Bike Shop, a retail bicycle dealer, which in turn sold it to Roth. Shortly thereafter, while Roth was riding the bicycle along a city street, he saw a traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, Roth quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brake, which failed. To avoid the traffic that was then crossing in front of him, Roth turned sharply to his right and onto the sidewalk, where he struck Perez, a pedestrian. Both Perez and Roth sustained injuries. Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules.

77. If Roth asserts a claim against Bike Shop based on strict liability in tort, will Roth prevail?
(A) Yes, if the brake failed because of a defect present when the bicycle left the factory of Cycle Company.
(B) Yes, because the brake failed while Roth was riding the bicycle.
(C) No, if Roth contributed to his own injury by speeding up.
(D) No, if Bike Shop carefully inspected the bicycle before selling it. 78. If Perez asserts a claim based on negligence against Cycle Company, and if it is found that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the bicycle, will Perez prevail?
(A) Yes, because Cycle Company placed a defective bicycle into the stream of commerce.
(B) Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by Cycle Company.
(C) No, because Perez was not a purchaser of the bicycle.
(D) No, if Roth was negligent in turning onto the sidewalk.

\section{Question 79}

Which of the following is least likely to be the underlying felony in a prosecution for felony murder?
(A) Arson.
(B) Manslaughter.
(C) Attempted rape.
(D) Burglary.

\section{Question 80}

While crossing Spruce Street, Pesko was hit by a car that she did not see. Pesko sued Dorry for her injuries.

At trial, Pesko calls Williams, a police officer, to testify that, 10 minutes after the accident, a driver stopped him and said, "Officer, a few minutes ago I saw a hit-and-run accident on Spruce Street involving a blue convertible, which I followed to the drive-in restaurant at Oak and Third," and that a few seconds later Williams saw Dorry sitting alone in a blue convertible in the drive-in restaurant's parking lot. Williams's testimony about the driver's statement should be:

(A) Admitted as a statement of recent perception.

(B) Admitted as a present sense impression.

(C) Excluded, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

(D) Excluded, because it is more prejudicial than probative.

Questions 81-83 are based on the following fact situation:

A written contract was entered into between Bouquet, a financier-investor, and Vintage Corporation, a winery and grape-grower. The contract provided that Bouquet would invest $\$ 1$ million in Vintage for its capital expansion and, in return, that Vintage, from grapes grown in its famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five years under the label "Premium Vintage-Bouquet."

The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by Vintage only through Claret, a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither Bouquet nor Vintage had previously dealt with Claret. Claret learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility. 81. If Vintage refuses to distribute the wine through Claret and Claret then sues Vintage for breach of contract, is it likely that Claret will prevail?
(A) Yes, because Vintage's performance was to run to Claret rather than to Bouquet.
(B) Yes, because Bouquet and Vintage could reasonably foresee that Claret would change his position in reliance on the contract.
(C) No, because Bouquet and Vintage did not expressly agree that Claret would have enforceable rights under their contract.
(D) No, because Bouquet and Vintage, having no apparent motive to benefit Claret, appeared in making the con- tract to have been protecting or serv- ing only their own interests.

82. For this question only, assume the following facts. Amicusbank lent Bouquet $\$ 200,000$ and Bouquet executed a written instrument providing that Amicusbank "is entitled to collect the debt from my share of the profits, if any, under the Vintage-Bouquet contract." Amicusbank gave prompt notice of this transaction to Vintage.

If Vintage thereafter refuses to account for any profits to Amicusbank and Amicusbank sues Vintage for Bouquet's share of profits then realized, Vintage's strongest argument in defense is that:
(A) The Bouquet-Vintage contract did not expressly authorize an assignment of rights.
(B) Bouquet and Vintage are partners, not simply debtor and creditor.

(C) Amicusbank is not an assignee of Bouquet's rights under the BouquetVintage contract.

(D) Amicusbank is not an intended thirdparty beneficiary of the BouquetVintage contract.

83. For this question only, assume the following facts. Soon after making its contract with Bouquet, Vintage, without Bouquet's knowledge or assent, sold its vineyards but not its winery to Agribiz, a large agricultural corporation. Under the terms of this sale, Agribiz agreed to sell to Vintage all grapes grown on the land for five years. Agribiz's employees have no experience in wine-grape production, and Agribiz has no reputation in the wine industry as a grape producer or otherwise. The BouquetVintage contract was silent on the matter of Vintage's selling any or all of its business assets.

If Bouquet seeks an appropriate judicial remedy against Vintage for entering into the Vintage-Agribiz transaction, is Bouquet likely to prevail?
(A) Yes, because the Vintage-Agribiz transaction created a significant risk of diminishing the profits in which Bouquet would share under his con- tract with Vintage.
(B) Yes, because the Bouquet-Vintage contract did not contain a provision authorizing a delegation of Vintage's duties.
(C) No, because Vintage remains in a position to perform under the Bou- quet-Vintage contract.
(D) No, because Vintage, as a corporation, must necessarily perform its contracts by delegating duties to individuals. 

\section{Question 84}

Miller applied to the state liquor board for transfer of the license of Miller's Bar and Grill to a new site. The board held a hearing on the application.

At that hearing, Hammond appeared without being subpoenaed and stated that Miller had underworld connections. Although Hammond did not know this information to be true, he had heard rumors about Miller's character and had noticed several underworld figures going in and out of Miller's Bar and Grill. In fact, Miller had no underworld connections.

In a claim against Hammond based on defamation, Miller will:

(A) Not recover if Hammond reasonably believed his statement to be true.

(B) Not recover if the board granted Miller's application.

(C) Recover, because Hammond's statement was false.

(D) Recover, because Hammond appeared before the board voluntarily.

\section{Question 85}

Arthur and Celia, brother and sister, both of legal age, inherited Goodacre, their childhood home, from their father. They thereby became tenants in common.

Goodacre had never been used as anything except a residence. Arthur had been residing on Goodacre with his father at the time his father died. Celia had been residing in a distant city. After their father's funeral, Arthur continued to live on Goodacre, but Celia returned to her own residence. There was no discussion between Arthur and Celia concerning their common ownership, nor had there ever been any administration of their father's estate. Arthur paid all taxes, insurance, and other carrying charges on Goodacre. He paid no rent or other compensation to Celia, nor did Celia request any such payment.

Thirty years later, a series of disputes arose between Arthur and Celia for the first time concerning their respective rights to Goodacre. The jurisdiction where the land is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies, and there is no applicable legislation on the subject.

If Arthur claims the entire title to Goodacre in fee simple and brings an action against Celia to quiet title in himself, and if the state where the land is located has an ordinary 20 -year adverse possession statute, the decision should be for:

(A) Arthur, because during the past 30 years Arthur has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy the adverse possession requirements.

(B) Arthur, because the acts of the parties indicate Celia's intention to renounce her right to inheritance.

(C) Celia, because there is no evidence that Arthur has performed sufficient acts to constitute her ouster.

(D) Celia, because one co-tenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another. 

\section{Question 86}

David is being tried in federal court for criminal conspiracy with John to violate federal narcotics law. At trial, the prosecutor calls David's new wife, Wanda, and asks her to testify about a meeting between David and John that she observed before she married David.

Which of the following is the most accurate statement of the applicable rule concerning whether Wanda may testify?
(A) The choice is Wanda's.
(B) The choice is David's.
(C) Wanda is permitted to testify only if both Wanda and David agree.
(D) Wanda is compelled to testify even if both Wanda and David object.

\section{Question 87}

Dillon held up a gasoline station. During the robbery he shot and killed a customer who attempted to apprehend him. Dillon was prosecuted for premeditated murder and convicted. Thereafter, he was indicted for armed robbery of the station. Before the trial, his attorney moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that further proceedings were unconstitutional because of Dillon's prior conviction.

The motion to dismiss should be:

(A) Granted, because once Dillon was convicted on any of the charges arising out of the robbery, the prosecution was constitutionally estopped from proceeding against Dillon on any charge stemming from the same transaction.

(B) Granted, because the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a subsequent trial on what is essentially a lesser included offense. (C) Denied, because there is no constitutional requirement that all known charges against Dillon be brought in the same prosecution.

(D) Denied, because estoppel does not apply when the defendant is charged with violating two different statutes.

\section{Question 88}

An appropriations act passed by Congress over the President's veto directs that $\$ 1$ billion "shall be spent" by the federal government for the development of a new military weapons system, which is available only from the Arms Corporation. On the order of the President, the Secretary of Defense refuses to authorize a contract for purchase of the weapons system. The Arms Corporation sues the Secretary of Defense, alleging an unlawful withholding of these federal funds.

The strongest constitutional argument for the Arms Corporation is that:

(A) Passage of an appropriation over a veto makes the spending mandatory.

(B) Congress's power to appropriate funds includes the power to require that the funds will be spent as directed.

(C) The President's independent constitutional powers do not specifically refer to spending.

(D) The President's power to withhold such funds is limited to cases where foreign affairs are directly involved. 

\section{Question 89}

Potts, a building contractor, sued Dennis for failure to pay on a small cost-plus construction contract. At trial, Potts, who personally supervised all of the work, seeks to testify to what he remembers about the amount of pipe used, the number of workers used on the job, and the number of hours spent grading.

Dennis objects on the ground that Potts had routinely recorded these facts in notebooks which are in Potts's possession.

Potts's testimony is:

(A) Admissible as a report of regularly conducted business activity.

(B) Admissible as based on firsthand knowledge.

(C) Inadmissible, because it violates the best evidence rule.

(D) Inadmissible, because a summary of writings cannot be made unless the originals are available for examination.

\section{Question 90}

A grand jury was investigating a bank robbery. The only information known to the prosecutor was a rumor that Taylor might have been involved. The grand jury subpoenaed Taylor. He refused to answer questions about the robbery and was granted use immunity. He then testified that he and Simmons had robbed the bank. The grand jury indicted both Taylor and Simmons for the bank robbery. The prosecutor permitted Simmons to enter a plea to a lesser offense in exchange for Simmons's agreement to testify against Taylor. The prosecutor had no evidence as to the identity of the robbers except the testimony of Simmons and Taylor. At Taylor's trial, his objection to Simmons's being permitted to testify should be:

(A) Sustained, because the prosecutor may not bargain away the rights of one co-defendant in a deal with another.

(B) Sustained, because Simmons's testimony was acquired as a result of Taylor's grand jury testimony.

(C) Overruled, because the police suspected Taylor even before he testified in the grand jury hearing.

(D) Overruled, because a witness cannot be precluded from testifying if his testimony is given voluntarily.

Questions 91-93 are based on the following fact situation:

Dino purchased a new Belchfire automobile from Dealer. Within a few days of the purchase, Dino returned the car to Dealer for repairs. Dino complained, "There's something wrong with the brakes. The car keeps pulling to the left whenever I apply them."' Dealer's mechanic readjusted the brakes but did not detect any other problem with the brake system. Dealer's mechanic told Dino, "You shouldn't have any more problems with those brakes. However, if the same problem does occur, don't panic. The car may pull to the left, but the brakes will still work, allowing you to stop the car."

Dino drove the car home. It worked fine for two days, but then the brakes started pulling to the left again. As Dino was driving the car back to Dealer's shop for further repair, he saw Pedestrian crossing the street. Dino pressed his foot down on the brake pedal, but the master cylinder failed, and the car would not stop. Dino's car struck Pedestrian, injuring him. 91. If Pedestrian sues Dino for his injuries:

(A) Pedestrian will prevail, because Dino knew that there was a problem with his brakes.

(B) Pedestrian will prevail, because drivers have a duty to maintain their vehicles in safe working order.

(C) Dino will prevail, because he had no reason to know that his brakes would not stop the car.

(D) Dino will prevail, because he diligently had his brakes repaired.

92. If Pedestrian sues Belchfire Motors, the manufacturer of Dino's car, on a theory of strict liability for his injuries:

(A) Pedestrian will prevail, because manufacturers are strictly liable for accidents that result from defects in their products.

(B) Pedestrian will prevail, if the master cylinder was defective when the vehicle left Belchfire's control.

(C) Belchfire will prevail, because Dealer's mechanic readjusted the brakes.

(D) Belchfire will prevail, unless the car model had a history of brake defects. 93. If Pedestrian brings a negligence action against Dealer for his injuries:

(A) Pedestrian will prevail, if the car was sold by Dealer with an unreasonably dangerous defect.

(B) Pedestrian will prevail, because Dealer's mechanic did not discover the defective cylinder.

(C) Dealer will prevail, unless the defect should have been discovered when the mechanic inspected the car.

(D) Dealer will prevail, unless Belchfire was negligent in designing or manufacturing the master cylinder. 

\section{Question 94}

Fernwood Realty Company developed a residential development, known as the Fernwood Development, which included single-family dwellings, town houses, and high-rise apartments for a total of 25,000 dwelling units. Included in the deed to each unit was a covenant under which the grantee and the grantee's "heirs and assigns" agreed to purchase electrical power only from a plant Fernwood promised to build and maintain within the development. Fernwood constructed the plant and the necessary power lines. The plant did not supply power outside the development. An appropriate and fair formula was used to determine price.

After constructing and selling 12,500 of the units, Fernwood sold its interest in the development to Gaint Realty Investors. Gaint operated the power plant and constructed and sold the remaining 12,500 units. Each conveyance from Gaint contained the same covenant relating to electrical power that Fernwood had included in the 12,500 conveyances it had made.

Page bought a dwelling unit from Olm, who had purchased it from Fernwood. Subsequently, Page, whose lot was along the boundary of the Fernwood development, ceased buying electrical power from Gaint and began purchasing power from General Power Company, which provided such service in the area surrounding the Fernwood development. Both General Power and Gaint have governmental authorization to provide electrical services to the area. Gaint instituted an appropriate action against Page to enjoin her from obtaining electrical power from General Power.

If judgment is for Page, it most likely will be because:
(A) The covenant does not touch and concern the land.
(B) The mixture of types of residential units is viewed as preventing one common devel- opment scheme.

(C) The covenant is a restraint on alienation.

(D) There is no privity of estate between Page and Gaint.

\section{Question 95}

Amy Docent, a state college instructor, was discharged because of her refusal to comply with a state statute requiring public employees to swear or affirm that they will (1) "uphold and defend" the state and federal constitutions, and (2) "oppose the overthrow" of the state or federal governments "by force, violence, or by any improper method." The statute had previously been held constitutional by the state supreme court. Docent filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the statute and seeking an injunction and damages.

Which of the following is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the statute?
(A) Government employment is a privilege, not a right.
(B) The oath as a whole is only a commitment to abide by constitutional processes.
(C) The First and Fourteenth Amendments permit a state to fix the conditions of state employment.
(D) The state has a compelling need to keep disloyal persons out of governmental positions of trust. Questions 96-97 are based on the following fact situation:

On January 2, Hugh Homey and Sue Structo entered into a written contract in which Structo agreed to build on Homey's lot a new house for Homey, according to plans and specifications furnished by Homey's architect, Barbara Bilevel, at a contract price of $\$ 200,000$. The contract provided for specified progress payments and a final payment of $\$ 40,000$ upon Homey's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. Further, under a "liquidated damages" clause in the agreement, Structo promised to pay Homey $\$ 500$ for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October l. Homey, however, told Structo on January 2 , before the contract was signed, that he would be on an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house until November 1.

96. For this question only, assume the following facts. Because she was overextended on other construction jobs, Structo did not complete the house until October 15. Homey returned on November 1 as planned and occupied the house. Ten days later, after making the $\$ 40,000$ final payment to Structo, Homey learned for the first time that the house had not been completed until October 15.

If Homey sues Structo for breach of contract on account of the 15-day delay in completion, which of the following will the court probably decide?

(A) Homey will recover damages as specified in the contract, i.e., $\$ 500$ multiplied by 15 .

(B) Homey will recover his actual damages, if any, caused by the delay in completion.

(C) Having waived the delay by occupying the house and making the final payment, Homey will recover nothing. (D) Homey will recover nothing because the contractual completion date was impliedly modified to November 1 when Homey on January 2 advised Structo about Homey's prospective trip and return date.

97. For this question only, assume the following facts: Structo completed the house on October 14 and, when Homey returned on November 1 , requested the final payment of $\$ 40,000$ and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect, Bilevel. Homey, however, refused to pay any part of the final installment after Bilevel told him, "Structo did a great job and I find no defects worth mentioning, but Structo's contract price was at least $\$ 40,000$ too high, especially in view of the big drop in housing values within the past 10 months. I will withhold the final certificate, and you just hold on to your money."

If Structo sues Homey for the $\$ 40,000$ final payment after Bilevel's refusal to issue a final certificate, which of the following will the court probably decide?

(A) Structo wins, because nonoccurrence of the condition requiring Bilevel's certificate of final approval was excused by Bilevel's bad-faith refusal to issue the certificate.

(B) Structo wins, but, because all contractual conditions have not occurred, her recovery is limited to restitution of the benefit conferred on Homey, minus progress payments already received.

(C) Homey wins, provided he can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the fair-market value of the completed house is $\$ 160,000$ or less.

(D) Homey wins, provided he can prove by clear and convincing evidence that total payments to Structo of $\$ 160,000$ will yield a fair net profit. 

\section{Question 98}

Acting on an anonymous telephone call, police went to Desmond's apartment, knocked on the door, and demanded to search it for narcotics. When Desmond refused, the police forced the door open and placed him under arrest. As they were removing him from the apartment, Desmond offered to give the officers "valuable information" in exchange for his release. Before he could say anything else, Desmond was given Miranda warnings by the police. Thereafter, he told the police that he had stored some heroin in his friend's apartment and that he and his friend had been going to sell it. The heroin was recovered, and Desmond was prosecuted for conspiracy to sell narcotics and for possession of narcotics. At his trial, Desmond moved to suppress his statements.

Which of the following is Desmond's best argument in support of the motion to suppress?

(A) Desmond is entitled to know the identity of his accuser, and the state cannot supply this information.

(B) The police should have given Desmond Miranda warnings prior to entry into the apartment, and the warnings were ineffectual once Desmond offered to give the police information.

(C) Desmond was intimidated by the forced entry into the apartment, and since the statements were involuntary and coerced, their use against him would violate due process of law.

(D) The statements were fruits of an unlawful arrest, and though the Miranda warnings may have been sufficient to protect his right against self-incrimination, they were not sufficient to purge the taint of the illegal arrest.

\section{Question 99}

Supermedia, a television station, was conducting a "person on the street" interview segment live for its evening "magazine" show and asking citizens of the community what they thought were the biggest problems facing the city. When the interviewer stopped Don and asked him the question, he replied, "Corruption in city government, particularly the mayor."

William, mayor of the city, has now brought an action for defamation against Don. At trial, William has produced testimony as to his honesty and good character.

Which of the following evidence could Don properly adduce at trial as part of his defense?

I. The fact that William was convicted two years ago of taking a bribe to award a city contract for solid waste disposal.

II. The testimony of Harold, a local newspaper editor, that William is known throughout the state as a corrupt politician.

III. The testimony of Allen, a former campaign manager of William's, that William was corrupt.
(A) I. only.
(B) I. and II. only.
(C) I. and III. only.
(D) I., II., and III. 

\section{Question 100}

Purr entered into a written contract to buy Oldacre from Venn at a price of $\$ 160,000$. At the time the contract was entered into, Purr gave Venn a cashier's check for $\$ 10,000$, representing Purr's "earnest money." According to procedures provided for by state law, the contract was promptly and properly recorded in the office of the county's Recorder of Deeds. The closing date was set for April 29.

On April 17, Purr's attorney conducted a title search, during which the lawyer discovered that Venn's distant cousin, Kuzz, had a legitimate claim to a $1 / 10$ undivided interest in Oldacre, based upon some confusing language in the will of Venn's grandfather, from whom Venn inherited Oldacre. On April 26, Purr paid Kuzz $\$ 10,000$ and Kuzz gave Purr a quitclaim deed, surrendering any and all interest Kuzz had in Oldacre. Purr informed Venn of the situation and told Venn, "I'll see you at the closing." On April 29, Purr appeared at the Equity Title Company offices at the time appointed in the land-sale contract for the closing. Purr tendered a certified check to the closing officer, but Venn never appeared at the closing. Purr asked the closing officer to place the certified check in escrow and promptly sued Venn for specific performance. Will Purr prevail in his specific performance action?
(A) Yes, if the certified check is for $\$ 150,000$.
(B) Yes, if the certified check is for $\$ 140,000$.
(C) No, because Purr should have informed Venn of the title defect to allow Venn to obtain marketable title, but Venn must return Purr's earnest money.
(D) No, because Purr has become a co-tenant of Venn and an action for partition rather than specific performance is appropriate.

\section{Question 101}

Egbert, who was sent to prison for nine years for car theft, vowed to get even with Charles, the prosecutor at his trial. While in prison, Egbert was told by another prisoner, Duane, that when Charles was in private practice as a criminal defense attorney, he had represented Duane in a drug charge. Duane claimed that because he did not have the cash to pay Charles his fees, he offered to pay his fees with five ounces of cocaine, and Charles accepted.

Although Egbert had no independent reason to believe that what Duane said was true, when he got out of prison he learned that Charles was running for District Attorney. Egbert went to one of the local papers and sold them the story for $\$ 1,000$. In the article that resulted, Egbert was quoted as saying "I only hope that Charles suffers like I had to suffer for the last nine years."

Although the allegation was false, Charles withdrew from the race as a result of the article.

In a suit by Charles against Egbert for defamation, the probable result would be:

(A) Charles prevails because Egbert acted with deliberate malice towards Charles.

(B) Charles prevails if Egbert should have known that the story was false.

(C) Egbert prevails because the story was a matter of public concern.

(D) Egbert prevails if he honestly believed the truth of the assertion made by Duane.

\section{Question 102}

A statute in a jurisdiction makes it a crime to sell ammunition to a minor (defined as a person under the age of 18). The courts have interpreted this statute as creating a strict liability offense that does not require knowledge of the age of the purchaser and as creating vicarious liability. Duncan, who was 16 years old, but looked four or five years older, entered a store owned by Mathews and asked a clerk for a box of .22 caliber shells. Mathews had instructed her employees not to sell ammunition to minors. The clerk asked Duncan his age. Duncan said he was 20 . The clerk then placed a box of shells on the counter and asked, "Anything else?" Duncan said that was all he wanted but then discovered he did not have enough money to pay for the shells, so the clerk put the box back onto the shelf.

If Mathews, the owner of the store, is charged with attempting to violate the statute, her best argument would be that:
(A) It was impossible for the sale to have occurred.
(B) She had strictly instructed her employees not to sell ammunition to minors.
(C) Duncan lied about his age.
(D) The clerk did not have the mental state needed for attempt. 

\section{Question 103}

Technix, Inc. produces the most up-to-date, high-speed mainframe computers on the market, and Cruncher Corporation is on the cutting edge of data storage technology. Technix and Cruncher contracted to purchase/sell a "Yellow Giant" computer. The written contract stated that Cruncher would purchase "one Technix 'Yellow Giant' computer at a price of $\$ 175,000$." At the time, the going price for Yellow Giant computers was $\$ 150,000$. When Technix delivered a Yellow Giant on the specified date, Cruncher refused to accept delivery and refused to pay. Technix sued Cruncher for breach, claiming that its expensive computers were manufactured to order and so it was forced to dispose of the Yellow Giant at a price far below fair market value. In defending the suit, Cruncher's president wishes to testify that Cruncher rejected the Yellow Giant because both parties knew that Cruncher really wanted a "Purple Giant," a machine much faster than the Yellow Giant, but which the parties agreed would be called in the contract a "Yellow Giant" to keep competitors in the dark as to Cruncher's new capabilities, and that the parties had executed contracts in the past that had specified a less powerful computer than the model that was actually delivered.

Should the testimony of Cruncher's president be admitted?
(A) Yes, because Cruncher is entitled to refor- mation of the contract.
(B) Yes, because the president's testimony would explain the meaning of a disputed contract term.
(C) No, because the parol evidence rule applies and the president's testimony contradicts a term in the written contract.
(D) No, because the Statute of Frauds applies, since the contract is for a large amount of money.

Questions 104-105 are based on the following fact situation:

The state of Floribama has recently had a problem with people dealing in, and with, its booming garment industry. The use of independent contractors by major garment makers, most of whom were headquartered out of state, had led to the hiring of illegal aliens to work under conditions reminiscent of 19 th century sweatshops.

The legislature of Floribama enacted a statute to remedy the situation and to protect its citizens against the problems in the future. The statute provides:

I. That all garment makers must be licensed by the state attorney general.

II. That all subcontractors (defined separately in the statute) must be separately licensed by the attorney general and must have been a citizen of the United States for five years and a resident of Floribama for one year.

104. The requirement that garment makers be licensed by the attorney general is:

(A) Constitutional, because it is within the proper scope of the exercise of the police powers of the state.

(B) Constitutional, because the attorney general is designated as the proper person to enforce the law.

(C) Unconstitutional, as a burden on interstate commerce.

(D) Unconstitutional, as a violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV. 105. The second clause of the legislation concerning subcontractors is subject to a constitutional challenge based on:
(A) The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(B) The Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(C) The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
(D) The Tenth Amendment reserved powers of the state.

\section{Question 106}

In litigation over the estate of Baggs, who died intestate, Payton, who is 18 years old, claimed to be Baggs's niece and entitled, therefore, to a share of his large estate. In support of her claim, Payton offered in evidence a Bible, properly identified as having belonged to Baggs's family, in the front of which was a list of family births, marriages, and deaths. The list recorded Payton's birth to Baggs's oldest sister.

To prove that Payton is Baggs's niece, the Bible listing is:

(A) Admissible as an ancient document.

(B) Admissible as a family record.

(C) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

(D) Inadmissible, because there was no showing of firsthand knowledge by the one who wrote it.

\section{Question 107}

Taylor and Scott, an unmarried couple, purchased a condominium as tenants in common and lived in the condominium for three years. Subsequently, they made an oral agreement that, on the death of either of them, the survivor would own the entire condominium, and, as a result, they decided they did not need wills.

Two years later, Taylor and Scott were involved in the same automobile accident. Taylor was killed immediately. Scott died one week later. Both died intestate. Taylor's sole heir is his brother, Mark. Scott's sole heir is her mother, Martha. Mark claimed one-half of the condominium, and Martha claimed all of it. The jurisdiction has no applicable statute except for the Statute of Frauds; nor does it recognize common law marriages.

In an appropriate action by Martha claiming the entire ownership of the condominium, the court will find that:

(A) Martha owns the entire interest because Taylor and Scott did not make wills in reliance upon their oral agreement.

(B) Martha owns the entire interest because she is entitled to reformation of the deed to reflect the oral agreement.

(C) Mark and Martha each own an undivided one-half interest because Taylor and Scott each died as the result of the same accident.

(D) Mark and Martha each own an undivided one-half interest because the Statute of Frauds applies. 

\section{Question 108}

A state statute provides that only citizens of the United States may be employed by that state. In an action brought in a federal court, a resident alien who was prevented from obtaining state employment as a garbage collector solely because of his alien status challenged the statute's constitutionality as applied to his circumstances.

Which of the following statements concerning the burden of persuasion applicable to this suit is correct?

(A) The alien must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the citizenship requirement and any legitimate state interest.

(B) The alien must demonstrate that the citizenship requirement is not necessary to advance an important state interest.

(C) The state must demonstrate that there is a rational relationship between the citizenship requirement and a legitimate state interest.

(D) The state must demonstrate that the citizenship requirement is necessary to advance a compelling state interest.

\section{Question 109}

Chemco designed and built a large tank on its premises for the purpose of storing highly toxic gas. The tank developed a sudden leak and escaping toxic gas drifted into the adjacent premises, where Nyman lived. Nyman inhaled the gas and died as a result.

In a suit brought by Nyman's personal representative against Chemco, which of the following must be established if the claim is to prevail?

I. The toxic gas that escaped from Chemco's premises was the cause of Nyman's death.

II. The tank was built in a defective manner.

III. Chemco was negligent in designing the tank.
(A) I. only.
(B) I. and II. only.
(C) I. and III. only.
(D) I., II., and III.

\section{Question 110}

Pullen used aluminum brackets in her business. On the telephone listed as hers in the telephone book, Pullen received a call in which the caller said, "This is John Denison of Denison Hardware Company. We have a special on aluminum brackets this week at $30 \%$ off." Pullen ordered brackets from the caller. When the brackets were never delivered, Pullen sued Denison for breach of contract.

At trial, Denison, who denies having made the telephone call, objects to Pullen's testimony concerning it. When asked, Pullen testifies that, aside from the telephone call, she had never heard Denison speak until she met him in the judge's chambers before the trial and that, in her opinion, the voice on the telephone was Denison's.

The strongest argument for admission of Pullen's testimony concerning the telephone call is that:
(A) The call related to business reasonably transacted over the telephone.
(B) The call was received at a number assigned to Pullen by the telephone company.
(C) After hearing Denison speak in chambers, Pullen recognized Denison's voice as that of the person on the telephone.
(D) Self-identification is sufficient authentica- tion of a telephone call. 

\section{Question 111}

Drake owned a small warehouse that he leased to Teague, who used it as a storage and distribution center for fresh cut flowers being shipped to area florists. Drake wanted to put Teague out of business so that he could lease the warehouse to someone else at a higher rent. $\mathrm{He}$ entered the warehouse one night using a master key, and turned off the cooling system to destroy the flowers. To ensure that all of Teague's inventory would be destroyed, he also deployed several kerosene space heaters. While he was filling one, a small amount of kerosene spilled and was ignited by an ash from his cigarette. Although the fire that started was small at first, Drake panicked when he saw the flames and ran out of the building. The fire eventually spread to the walls of the building and heavily damaged it before being extinguished by firefighters.

If Drake is charged with arson, can he be found guilty?
(A) Yes, because Drake caused the fire during the commission of a malicious felony.
(B) Yes, because Drake did nothing when the kerosene caught on fire.
(C) No, because Drake did not intend to set the building on fire.
(D) No, because Drake cannot be liable for arson of a building that he owned.

\section{Question 112}

Dietz and Atkins worked together as pickpockets. Dietz approached Verner from the front to distract him, holding a small camera and asking him to take a picture, while Atkins came up from behind with a knife to slice open Verner's back pocket of his pants and remove his wallet. Verner was drunk and believed Dietz had a gun and was trying to rob him, but was unaware of Atkins behind him. Verner reached into his back pocket to hand over his wallet and was cut by Atkins's knife as it was slicing through his pocket. The wallet dropped to the ground as Verner clutched his hand. Atkins picked it up and Dietz and Atkins fled while Verner knelt on the ground in pain. Dietz was apprehended shortly thereafter and charged with robbery.

Should Dietz be found guilty?
(A) Yes, because Atkins obtained the property by means of force.
(B) Yes, because Verner believed that Dietz would shoot him if he did not give up his wallet.
(C) No, because neither Dietz nor Atkins intended to use force against Verner to obtain the property.
(D) No, because Verner's belief that Dietz was robbing him was unreasonable. 

\section{Question 113}

Professor Peterson, an expert on American Colonial and Revolutionary History, conducted full-day tours through the historic sites of Philadelphia every Wednesday and Thursday through the summer months. Peterson's fee for his services was $\$ 105$, which did not include the entrance fees for several of the historical sites. Other persons and organizations conducted various American history tours through the city for somewhat less than Peterson, but Peterson's tour was generally rated the best by the leading tourist guidebooks because Peterson personally conducted the tours and shared his encyclopedic knowledge of American history and the city of Philadelphia.

David had recently moved to Philadelphia, and all of his co-workers praised Professor Peterson's tour, but David was not inclined to pay $\$ 105$ for a tour of the historical sites of his new city. Therefore, David took a day off one Thursday and "hung around" the Liberty Bell monument, where Peterson's tour started. That day Peterson was conducting 27 persons on the tour. Most of the participants had paid in advance, but Peterson was holding up a sign with information about the tour and handing out brochures, one of which David took. Peterson accepted a few additional participants who signed up on the spot, but David was not among them. All day long, David hung around at the fringe of this group, paying the entrance fees separately but following the group through the different historical sites. However, he always positioned himself close enough to Peterson's group so that he could hear virtually every word of Peterson's lecture, although David did not ask Peterson any questions. David signed his name and address on the register at Independence Hall. Peterson noted this and took down the information. Two days after the tour concluded, David received a bill from Peterson in the amount of $\$ 105$.

David will most likely be required to pay Peterson: (A) $\$ 105$, because that is the contract price for the tour.

(B) $\$ 105$, because the amount of the contract was less than $\$ 500$, making the Statute of Frauds inapplicable.

(C) $\$ 105$, if that is a reasonable fee for the lectures based on Peterson's expertise.

(D) Nothing, because the historical sites were open to the public and David paid his own way.

\section{Question 114}

In compliance with a federal statute requiring buildings to be made accessible to persons with disabilities, Walter installed wheelchair ramps at both entrances to his office building located on Blackacre, which he had owned for many years. One year later, Walter entered into a contract with Barbara to sell Blackacre, including the office building. After having the property surveyed, Barbara notified Walter that she was not going to complete the sale because the wheelchair ramp on the south side of the building extended over the property line and into the adjoining parcel of Whiteacre, making the title unmarketable. Walter insisted that Barbara proceed with the sale, and brought an action to compel her performance.

If the court were to find that title is marketable, it will be because:
(A) The wheelchair ramp is required by federal law.
(B) Walter currently owns Whiteacre and acquired Whiteacre and Blackacre as part of a larger parcel.
(C) The wheelchair ramp extends only 10 inches over the property line.
(D) The contract between Walter and Barbara requires Walter to convey only a quitclaim deed. 

\section{Question 115}

An ordinance of City makes it unlawful to park a motor vehicle on a City street within 10 feet of a fire hydrant. At 1:55 p.m., Parker, realizing he must be in Bank before it closed at 2 p.m. and finding no other space available, parked his automobile in front of a fire hydrant on a City street. Parker then hurried into the bank, leaving his aged neighbor, Ned, as a passenger in the rear seat of the car. About five minutes later, and while Parker was still in Bank, Driver was driving down the street. Driver swerved to avoid what he mistakenly thought was a hole in the street and sideswiped Parker's car. Parker's car was turned over on top of the hydrant, breaking the hydrant and causing a small flood of water. Parker's car was severely damaged and Ned was badly injured. There is no applicable guest statute and the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules.

If Ned asserts a claim against Parker, the most likely result is that Ned will:

(A) Recover, because Parker's action was negligence per se.

(B) Recover, because Parker's action was a continuing wrong that contributed to Ned's injuries.

(C) Not recover, because a reasonably prudent person could not foresee injury to Ned as a result of Parker's action.

(D) Not recover, because a violation of a city ordinance does not give rise to a civil cause of action.

Questions 116-118 are based on the following fact situation:

On May 1, Ohner telegraphed Byer, "Will sell you any or all of the lots in Grove subdivision at $\$ 5,000$ each. Details follow in letter." The letter contained all the necessary details concerning terms of payment, insurance, mortgages, etc., and provided, "This offer remains open until June 1.' On May 2, after he had received the telegram but before he had received the letter, Byer telegraphed Ohner, "Accept your offer with respect to lot 101." Both parties knew that there were 50 lots in the Grove subdivision and that they were numbered 101 through 150 .

116. For this question only, assume that Ohner and Byer were bound by a contract for the sale of lot 101 for $\$ 5,000$, that on May 3 Ohner telephoned Byer and stated that because he had just discovered that a shopping center was going to be erected adjacent to the Grove subdivision, he would "need to have $\$ 6,000$ for each of the lots including lot $101, "$ that Byer thereupon agreed to pay him $\$ 6,000$ for lot 101 , and that on May 6, Byer telegraphed, "Accept your offer with respect to the rest of the lots." Assuming that two contracts were formed and that there is no controlling statute, Byer will most likely be required to pay:
(A) Only $\$ 5,000$ for each of the 50 lots.
(B) Only $\$ 5,000$ for lot 101 , but $\$ 6,000$ for the remaining 49 lots.
(C) $\$ 6,000$ for each of the 50 lots.
(D) $\$ 6,000$ for lot 101 , but only $\$ 5,000$ for the remaining 49 lots. 117. For this question only, assume that on May 5, Ohner telephoned Byer stating that he had sold lots 102 through 150 to someone else on May 4, and that Byer thereafter telegraphed Ohner, "Will take the rest of the lots." Assume further that there is no controlling statute. In an action by Byer against Ohner for breach of contract, Byer will probably:

(A) Succeed, because Ohner had promised him that the offer would remain open until June 1.

(B) Succeed, because Ohner's attempted revocation was by telephone.

(C) Not succeed, because Byer's power of acceptance was terminated by Ohner's sale of the lots to another party.

(D) Not succeed, because Byer's power of acceptance was terminated by effective revocation.

118. For this question only, assume that on May 6, Byer telegraphed Ohner, "Will take the rest of the lots," and that on May 8, Ohner discovered that he did not have good title to the remaining lots. Which of the following would provide the best legal support to Ohner's contention that he was not liable for breach of contract as to the remaining 49 lots?
(A) Impossibility of performance.
(B) Unilateral mistake as to basic assump- tion.
(C) Termination of the offer by Byer's having first contracted to buy lot 101 .
(D) Excuse by failure of an implied condition precedent.

\section{Question 119}

Leonard was the high priest of a small cult of Satan worshippers living in New Arcadia. As a part of the practice of their religious beliefs, a cat was required to be sacrificed to the glory of Satan after a live dissection of the animal in which it endured frightful pain. In the course of such a religious sacrifice, Leonard was arrested on the complaint of the local Humane Society and charged under a statute punishing cruelty to animals.

On appeal, a conviction of Leonard probably will be:

(A) Sustained, on the grounds that belief in or worship of Satan does not enjoy constitutional protection.

(B) Sustained, on the grounds that sincere religious belief is not an adequate defense on these facts.

(C) Overturned, on the grounds that the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of religion and its expression was violated.

(D) Overturned, on the grounds that the beliefs of the cult members in the need for the sacrifice might be reasonable, and their act was religious. 

\section{Question 120}

Peters sued Dietrich, claiming that they had entered into an oral agreement whereby Dietrich agreed to hire Peters as Chief Engineer of Dietrich Products and Peters agreed to take the job at a specified salary, and that Dietrich had subsequently breached their employment contract by refusing to hire Peters. At the trial of Peters's suit, Dietrich took the stand and denied having any contract with Peters for employment or otherwise. In response, Peters offers into evidence a properly authenticated phone message to Dietrich's wife, Wanda, that Dietrich had left with the switchboard operator at her office. The message stated, "I know you won't be happy, but I've offered Peters the Chief Engineer position and he's accepted." Dietrich's attorney objects.

The phone message should be ruled:
(A) Admissible, because it is the statement of a party-opponent.
(B) Admissible, if it is a recent perception.
(C) Inadmissible, because it is a privileged communication between husband and wife.
(D) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.

Questions 121-122 are based on the following fact situation:

Husband and Wife were going through a nasty divorce. Wife hired Patrick, a retired detective, to spy on Husband. Patrick followed Husband to Hotel, where he saw Husband meet a woman and go into her hotel room. Patrick checked into the adjoining room, placed an electronic listening device on the wall, and listened to the activities of Husband and the woman in the next room. While Patrick was listening, a burglar broke into Patrick's room and hit Patrick over the head with a blackjack. As a result, Patrick was hospitalized. A state statute makes adultery a crime. 121. If Patrick sues Hotel for his injuries:

(A) Patrick will prevail if Hotel's management had reason to believe the hotel room locks were inadequate.

(B) Patrick will prevail, because innkeepers owe their guests a very high degree of care.

(C) Hotel will prevail, because the burglar was a superseding intervening cause.

(D) Hotel will prevail if it was in compliance with a state statute setting minimum standards for hotel room locks.

122. If Husband sues Patrick for invasion of privacy:

(A) Husband will win, because he had an expectation of privacy in the woman's hotel room.

(B) Husband will win, unless Patrick's electronic eavesdropping was legal.

(C) Husband will lose, because adultery is illegal.

(D) Husband will lose if Patrick published nothing about Husband's activities. 

\section{Question 123}

In 1975, Hubert Green executed his will which in pertinent part provided, "I hereby give, devise, and bequeath Greenvale to my surviving widow for life, remainder to such of my children as shall live to attain the age of 30 years, but if any child dies under the age of 30 years survived by a child or children, such child or children shall take and receive the share which his, her, or their parent would have received had such parent lived to attain the age of 30 years."

At the date of writing his will, Green was married to Susan, and they had two children, Allan and Beth. Susan died in 1980 and Hubert married Waverly in 1982. At his death in 1990 , Green was survived by his wife, Waverly, and three children, Allan, Beth, and Carter. Carter, who was born in 1984, was his child by Waverly.

In a jurisdiction that recognizes the common law Rule Against Perpetuities unmodified by statute, the result of the application of the Rule is that the:

(A) Remainder to the children and to the grandchildren is void because Green could have subsequently married a person who was unborn at the time Green executed his will.

(B) Remainder to the children is valid, but the substitutionary gift to the grandchildren is void because Green could have subsequently married a person who was unborn at the time Green executed his will.

(C) Gift in remainder to Allan and Beth or their children is valid, but the gift to Carter or his children is void.

(D) Remainder to the children and the substitutionary gift to the grandchildren are valid.

\section{Question 124}

Downs was indicted in state court for bribing a public official. During the course of the investigation, police had demanded and received from Downs's bank the records of Downs's checking account for the preceding two years. The records contained incriminating evidence. On the basis of a claim of violation of his constitutional rights, Downs moves to prevent the introduction of the records in evidence. His motion should be:

(A) Granted, because a search warrant should have been secured for seizure of the records.

(B) Granted, because the records covered such an extensive period of time that their seizure unreasonably invaded Downs's right of privacy.

(C) Denied, because the potential destructibility of the records, coupled with the public interest in proper enforcement of the criminal laws, created an exigent situation justifying the seizure.

(D) Denied, because the records were business records of the bank in which Downs had no legitimate expectation of privacy.

\section{Question 125}

Plummer, a well-known politician, was scheduled to address a large crowd at a political dinner. Just as Plummer was about to sit down at the head table, Devon pushed Plummer's chair to one side. As a result, Plummer fell to the floor. Plummer was embarrassed at being made to look foolish before a large audience but suffered no physical harm.

If Plummer asserts a claim against Devon for damages because of his embarrassment, will Plummer prevail?
(A) Yes, if Devon knew that Plummer was about to sit on the chair.
(B) Yes, if Devon negligently failed to notice that Plummer was about to sit on the chair.
(C) No, because Plummer suffered no physical harm along with his embarrassment.
(D) No, if in moving the chair Devon intended only a good-natured practical joke on Plummer. 

\section{Question 126}

Paulsen sued Daly for nonpayment of a personal loan to Daly, as evidenced by Daly's promissory note to Paulsen. Paulsen called Walters to testify that he knows Daly's handwriting and that the signature on the note is Daly's. On direct examination, to identify himself, Walters gave his name and address and testified that he had been employed by a roofing company for seven years.

During presentation of Daly's case, Daly called Wilson to testify that she is the roofing company's personnel manager and that she had determined, by examining the company's employment records, that Walters had worked there only three years.

The trial judge should rule that Wilson's testimony is:
(A) Inadmissible, because it is not the best evidence.
(B) Inadmissible, because it is impeachment on a collateral question.
(C) Admissible as evidence of a regularly conducted activity.
(D) Admissible as tending to impeach Walters's credibility.

\section{Question 127}

A federal statute set up a program of dental education. The statute provided that the Secretary of Health and Human Services "shall, on a current basis, spend all of the money appropriated for this purpose" and "shall distribute the appropriated funds" by a specified formula to state health departments that agree to participate in the program. In the current year Congress appropriated \$100 million for expenditure on this program.

To ensure a budget surplus in the current fiscal year, the President issued an executive order directing the various Cabinet Secretaries to cut expenditures in this year by $10 \%$ in all categories. He also ordered certain programs to be cut more drastically because he believed that "they are not as important to the general welfare as other programs." The President identified the dental education program as such a program and ordered it to be cut by $50 \%$. Assume that no other federal statutes are relevant.

To satisfy constitutional requirements, how much money must the Secretary of Health and Human Services distribute for the dental education program this year?
(A) \$50 million, because the President could reasonably determine that this program is not as important to the general welfare as other programs.
(B) \$50 million, because as chief executive the President has the constitutional authority to control the actions of all of his subordi- nates by executive order.
(C) $\$ 90$ million, because any more drastic cut for the program would be a denial of equal protection to beneficiaries of this program as compared to beneficiaries of other programs.
(D) \$100 million, because the President may not unilaterally suspend the effect of a valid federal statute imposing a duty to spend appropriated monies. 

\section{Question 128}

Four years ago, Owen held Blackacre, a tract of land, in fee simple absolute. In that year he executed and delivered to Price a quitclaim deed which purported to release and quitclaim to Price all of the right, title, and interest of Owen in Blackacre. Price accepted the quitclaim and placed the deed in his safe deposit box.

Owen was indebted to Crider in the amount of $\$ 35,000$. In September of the current year, Owen executed and delivered to Crider a warranty deed, purporting to convey the fee simple to Blackacre, in exchange for a full release of the debt he owed to Crider. Crider immediately recorded his deed.

In December, Price caused his quitclaim deed to Blackacre to be recorded and notified Crider that he (Price) claimed title.

Assume that there is no evidence of occupancy of Blackacre and assume, further, that the jurisdiction where Blackacre is situated has a recording statute which required good faith and value as elements of the junior claimant's priority. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the conflicting claims of Price and Crider?

(A) Price cannot succeed, because the quitclaim deed through which he claims prevents him from being bona fide (in good faith).

(B) The outcome will turn on the view taken as to whether Crider paid value within the meaning of the statute requiring this element.

(C) The outcome will turn on whether Price paid value (a fact not given in the statement).

(D) Price's failure to record until December of the current year estops him from asserting title against Crider.

\section{Question 129}

Brown contended that Green owed him $\$ 6,000$. Green denied that he owed Brown anything. Tired of the dispute, Green eventually signed a promissory note by which he promised to pay Brown $\$ 5,000$ in settlement of their dispute.

In an action by Brown against Green on the promissory note, which of the following, if true, would afford Green the best defense?

(A) Although Brown honestly believed that $\$ 6,000$ was owed by Green, Green knew that it was not owed.

(B) Although Brown knew that the debt was not owed, Green honestly was in doubt whether it was owed.

(C) The original claim was based on an oral agreement, which the Statute of Frauds required to be in writing.

(D) The original claim was an action on a contract, which was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.

\section{Question 130}

Ellis, an electrical engineer, designed an electronic game known as Zappo. Ellis entered into a licensing agreement with Toyco under which Toyco agreed to manufacture Zappo according to Ellis's specifications and to market it and pay a royalty to Ellis.

Carla, whose parents had purchased a Zappo game for her, was injured while playing with the game. Carla recovered a judgment against Toyco on the basis of a finding that the Zappo game was defective because of Ellis's improper design.

In a claim for indemnity against Ellis, will Toyco prevail?

(A) Yes, because as between Ellis and Toyco, Ellis was responsible for the design of Zappo.

(B) Yes, because Toyco and Ellis were joint tortfeasors.

(C) No, because Toyco, as the manufacturer, was strictly liable to Carla.

(D) No, if Toyco, by a reasonable inspection, could have discovered the defect in the design of Zappo. 

\section{Question 131}

Defendant was charged with murder. His principal defense was that he had killed in hot blood and should be guilty only of manslaughter. The judge instructed the jury that the state must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, that the killing was presumed to be murder, and that the charge could be reduced to manslaughter, and Defendant accordingly found guilty of this lesser offense, if Defendant showed by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the killing was committed in the heat of passion on sudden provocation. Defendant was convicted of murder. On appeal, he seeks a new trial and claims error in the judge's instructions to the jury.

Defendant's conviction will most probably be:

(A) Affirmed, because the judge carefully advised the jury of the state's obligation to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

(B) Affirmed, because Defendant's burden to show hot blood was not one of ultimate persuasion but only one of producing evidence to rebut a legitimate presumption.

(C) Reversed, because the instruction put a burden on Defendant that denied him due process of law.

(D) Reversed, because presumptions have a highly prejudicial effect and thus cannot be used on behalf of the state in a criminal case.

\section{Question 132}

While on walking patrol in a commercial district in the early evening, Officer Murdoch noticed that a light was on in Walker's Machine Shop. Curious about what was going on inside, the officer tried to look through the window of the shop, but it had been painted on the inside so that only a strip about three inches at the top, eight feet above street level, was still transparent. Officer Murdoch quietly brought two trash cans from a neighboring business over to the window, stood on them and saw, through the strip of unpainted window, that the shop owner's son Tommy was inside with a friend, sucking white powder into his nose through a rolled up tube of paper from off a small mirror. Recognizing from his experience and training that Tommy was snorting cocaine, Officer Murdoch knocked at the front door to the shop, and Tommy let him in. Murdoch immediately arrested Tommy and his friend. In the back room of the shop through whose window he had peered, Murdoch found and seized several grams of cocaine, a razor blade, and a mirror.

In Tommy's subsequent prosecution for possession of cocaine, Tommy seeks to bar introduction of the cocaine, mirror, and razor blade into evidence. His motion will probably be:
(A) Granted, because Officer Murdoch could not have known that Tommy was snorting cocaine absent a chemical test of the substance being snorted.
(B) Granted, because Officer Murdoch violated Tommy's reasonable expectation of priva- cy.
(C) Denied, because the search was incident to a valid arrest.
(D) Denied, because Tommy consented to Officer Murdoch's entry into the shop. 

\section{Question 133}

Parmott sued Dexter in an automobile collision case. At trial, Parmott wishes to show by extrinsic evidence that Wade, Dexter's primary witness, is Dexter's partner in a gambling operation.

This evidence is:
(A) Admissible as evidence of Wade's character.
(B) Admissible as evidence of Wade's possible bias in favor of Dexter.
(C) Inadmissible, because criminal conduct can be shown only by admission or record of conviction.
(D) Inadmissible, because bias must be shown on cross-examination and not by extrinsic evidence.

Questions 134-136 are based on the following fact situation:

Farquart had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son Junior and Junior's fiancee a house on their wedding day, planned for June 10 of the following year. Pursuant to that promise, Farquart telephoned his old contractor-friend Sawtooth and made the following oral agreement-each making full and accurate written notes thereof:

Sawtooth was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by Farquart, and Farquart was to pay therefor $\$ 20$ per tree. Sawtooth agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of $\$ 18,000$. Farquart agreed to make payments of $\$ 2,000$ on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1 upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders, Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met. Sawtooth delivered the cut logs to Farquart in July, when he also began building the house. Farquart made three $\$ 2,000$ payments for the work done in July, August, and September, without requiring a certificate. Sawtooth worked through October, but no work was done from November 1 to the end of February because of bad weather; and Farquart made no payments during that period. Sawtooth did not object. On March 1, Sawtooth demanded payment of $\$ 2,000$; but Farquart refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. Sawtooth thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement.

134. Assuming that Sawtooth committed a total breach on March 1, what would be the probable measure of Farquart's damages in an action against Sawtooth for breach of contract?
(A) Restitution of the three monthly installments paid in August, Septem- ber, and October.
(B) What it would cost to get the house completed by another contractor, minus installments not yet paid to Sawtooth.
(C) The difference between the market value of the partly built house, as of the time of Sawtooth's breach, and the market value of the house if com- pleted according to specifications.
(D) In addition to other legally allowable damages, an allowance for Farquart's mental distress if the house cannot be completed in time for Junior's wed- ding on June 10. 135. Assuming that Sawtooth committed a total breach on March 1, and assuming further that he was aware when the agreement was made of the purpose for which Farquart wanted the completed house, which of the following, if true, would best support Farquart's claim for consequential damages on account of delay beyond June 10 in getting the house finished?

(A) Junior and his bride, married on June 10 , would have to pay storage charges on their wedding gifts and new furniture until the house could be completed.

(B) Junior's fiancee jilted Junior on June 10 and ran off with another man who had a new house.

(C) Farquart was put to additional expense in providing Junior and his bride, married on June 10, with temporary housing.

(D) On June 10, Farquart paid a $\$ 5,000$ judgment obtained against him in a suit filed March 15 by an adjoining landowner on account of Farquart's negligent excavation, including blasting, in an attempt to finish the house himself after Sawtooth's repudiation.

136. What was the probable legal effect of the following?

I. Sawtooth's failure to object to Farquart's making no payments on November 1, December 1, January 1 , and February 1.

II. Farquart's making payments in August through October without requiring a certificate from Builders.

(A) Estoppel-type waiver as to both I. and II.

(B) Waiver of delay in payment as to I. and revocable waiver as to II. (C) Mutual rescission of the contract by I. combined with II.

(D) Discharge of Farquart's duty to make the four payments as to I. and estoppel-type waiver as to II.

\section{Question 137}

Rogers gave Mitchell a power of attorney containing the following provision:

My attorney, Mitchell, is specifically authorized to sell and convey any part or all of my real property.

Mitchell conveyed part of Rogers's land to Stone by deed in the customary form containing covenants of title. Stone sues Rogers for breach of a covenant.

The outcome of Stone's suit will be governed by whether:

(A) Deeds without covenants are effective to convey realty.

(B) The jurisdiction views the covenants as personal or running with the land.

(C) Stone is a bona fide purchaser.

(D) The power to "sell and convey" is construed to include the power to execute the usual form of deed used to convey realty. 

\section{Question 138}

Responding to an open bid solicitation from the procurement office of the Defense Department, Midwest Technologies submitted a bid for the development of a new flame-resistant fabric. Upon review of the bids, Midwest was notified that it was the low bidder; however, its bid for the contract was denied because of its failure to meet guidelines on minority representation that the procurement office imposed on firms contracting with the Defense Department. Several months later, the project was rebid. Although Midwest did not participate, company officials later learned that the contract had been awarded to another regional company, Great Plains Technologies, after the procurement office waived its minority representation guidelines for that project. Midwest filed an action in federal district court seeking only to enjoin performance of the contract.

The court should:

(A) Dismiss the action, because Midwest cannot show a relationship between the procurement office's award of the contract and any injury that it may be claiming.

(B) Dismiss the action, because the federal government may enter into contracts under whatever conditions it chooses.

(C) Decide the case on the merits, because the procurement office must show that its waiver of the minority representation guidelines was necessary to further a compelling government interest.

(D) Decide the case on the merits, because Midwest can claim that the unequal treatment of the two bidders violated its rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

\section{Question 139}

Phyllis was crossing the street at a crosswalk, but did not look both ways. As she walked, Phyllis was hit by a car driven by Brett, and immediately afterwards, she was struck by a car driven by Andrew. As a result of these collisions with the cars, Phyllis suffered severe injuries. Although it was impossible to determine which portion of Phyllis's injuries was caused by Andrew and which by Brett, at the trial of Phyllis's suit, the jury determined that Andrew was $20 \%$ negligent, that Brett was $40 \%$ negligent, and that Phyllis was $40 \%$ negligent. It was further determined that Phyllis had suffered $\$ 100,000$ in damages. Phyllis had already received $\$ 10,000$ from her group medical insurance plan. Andrew had a $\$ 500,000$ auto liability insurance policy, and Brett is now insolvent.

In a pure comparative negligence jurisdiction, how much will Phyllis recover in damages from Andrew?
(A) $\$ 90,000$.
(B) $\$ 60,000$.
(C) $\$ 50,000$.
(D) $\$ 20,000$. 

\section{Question 140}

Ben contracted to buy Woodacre, a parcel of land, from Owen, with deed to be delivered and money paid on August 1 . Ben planned to build a high-rise building on Woodacre. Ben had visually inspected the land, but did not take any special notice of the fact that a stream flowed up to the eastern property line of Woodacre and reappeared just beyond the western property line. In fact, there was a conduit under the surface of Woodacre through which the waters of the stream were diverted. On July 28 , one of Ben's friends mentioned the existence of the conduit to Ben. Ben was amazed, and when Owen tendered a deed to Woodacre on August 1, Ben refused to accept it, stating, "I wouldn't have tried to buy Woodacre if I'd known about that conduit."

Owen files suit, demanding performance by Ben or damages for breach. Who should prevail?

(A) Owen, because Ben had ample opportunity to discover the existence of the conduit before he agreed to buy Woodacre.

(B) Owen, because the purpose for which Ben intended to use Woodacre is irrelevant.

(C) Ben, because Owen had a duty to provide a marketable title.

(D) Ben, because of the doctrine of frustration of purpose.

\section{Question 141}

Donaldson broke into Professor Ruiz's office to look at examination questions. The questions were locked in a drawer, and Donaldson could not find them. Donaldson believed that looking at examination questions was a crime, but in this belief he was mistaken. Charged with burglary, Donaldson should be:

(A) Acquitted, because he did not complete the crime and he has not been charged with attempt.

(B) Acquitted, because what he intended to do when he broke in was not a crime.

(C) Convicted, because he had the necessary mental state and committed the act of breaking and entering.

(D) Convicted, because factual impossibility is not a defense.

\section{Question 142}

Nolan was negligently driving down the road, not paying attention to where he was going. Because of this, he hit and seriously injured Sue, who was lawfully crossing the street. The accident was witnessed by Martha, who suffered extreme emotional distress that physically affected her nervous system.

Martha brings suit against Nolan for negligent infliction of emotional distress in a jurisdiction that has not adopted the "foreseeability" test for this tort.

The most likely result of the suit will be that:

(A) Martha will win, because she witnessed Sue being seriously injured by Nolan.

(B) Martha will win, because severe shock to the nervous system constitutes a physical injury.

(C) Martha will lose, unless she was crossing the street with Sue.

(D) Martha will lose, unless she was a close relative of Sue. 

\section{Question 143}

An issue in Parker's action against Daves for causing Parker's back injury was whether Parker's condition had resulted principally from a similar occurrence five years before, with which Daves had no connection.

Parker called Watts, his treating physician, who offered to testify that when she saw Parker after the latest occurrence, Parker told her that before the accident he had been working fulltime, without pain or limitation of motion, in a job that involved lifting heavy boxes.

Watts's testimony should be:

(A) Admitted, because it is a statement of Parker's then-existing physical condition.

(B) Admitted, because it is a statement made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.

(C) Excluded, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

(D) Excluded, because Parker is available as a witness.

\section{Question 144}

A state statute requires the permanent removal from parental custody of any child who has suffered "child abuse." That term is defined to include "corporal punishment of any sort."

Zeller very gently spanks his six-year-old son on the buttocks whenever he believes that spanking is necessary to enforce discipline on him. Such a spanking occurs no more than once a month and has never physically harmed the child.

The state files suit under the statute to terminate Zeller's parental rights solely because of these spankings. Zeller defends only on the ground that the statute in question is unconstitutional as applied to his admitted conduct. In light of the nature of the rights involved, which of the following is the most probable burden of persuasion on this constitutional issue? (A) The state has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to Zeller is necessary to vindicate a compelling state interest.

(B) The state has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to Zeller is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

(C) Zeller has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to him is not necessary to vindicate an important state interest.

(D) Zeller has the burden of persuading the court that the application of this statute to him is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

Questions 145-146 are based on the following fact situation:

Dunbar and Balcom went into a drugstore, where Dunbar reached into the cash register and took out $\$ 200$. Stone, the owner of the store, came out of a back room, saw what had happened, and told Dunbar to put the money back. Balcom then took a revolver from under his coat and shot and killed Stone.

Dunbar claims that Stone owed her $\$ 200$ and that she went to the drugstore to try to collect the debt. She said that she asked Balcom to come along just in case Stone made trouble but that she did not plan on using any force and did not know that Balcom was armed. 145. If Dunbar is prosecuted for murder on the basis of felony murder and the jury believes her claim, she should be found:

(A) Guilty, because her companion, Balcom, committed a homicide in the course of a felony.

(B) Guilty, because her taking Balcom with her to the store created the risk of death that occurred during the commission of a felony.

(C) Not guilty, because she did not know that Balcom was armed and thus did not have the required mental state for felony murder.

(D) Not guilty, because she believed she was entitled to the money and thus did not intend to steal.

146. If Dunbar is prosecuted for murder on the basis of being an accessory to Balcom in committing a murder and the jury believes her claim, she should be found:

(A) Guilty, because in firing the shot Balcom was trying to help her.

(B) Guilty, because she and Balcom were acting in concert in a dangerous undertaking.

(C) Not guilty, because she had no idea that Balcom was armed and she did not plan to use force.

(D) Not guilty, because she was exercising self-help and did not intend to steal.

\section{Question 147}

Duncan was charged with aggravated assault. At trial Duncan did not testify; however, he sought to offer opinion evidence of his good character for truth and veracity. This testimony should be:
(A) Admitted, because a criminal defendant is entitled to offer evidence of his good character.
(B) Admitted, because a party's credibility is necessarily in issue.
(C) Excluded, because evidence of character is not admissible to prove conduct in confor- mity therewith.
(D) Excluded, because it is evidence of a trait not pertinent to the case.

\section{Question 148}

Otto conveyed Goldacre to "Andy, his heirs and assigns, but if Andy dies and is not survived by children by his present wife, Jane, then to Bob and his heirs and assigns." Shortly after taking possession, Andy discovered rich metal deposits on the land, opened a mining operation, and removed and sold a considerable quantity of valuable ore without giving Bob any notice of his action. Andy has no children. Andy, Jane, and Bob are all still living. Bob brought an action in equity for an accounting of the value of the ore removed and for an injunction against further removal.

If the decision is for Andy, it will be because:
(A) Bob has no interest in Goldacre.
(B) The right to take minerals is an incident of a defeasible fee simple.
(C) The right to take minerals is an incident of the right to possession.
(D) There was no showing that Andy acted in bad faith. 

\section{Question 149}

After being notified by Dr. Josephs that Nurse Norris's employment with his office was terminated, Norris applied for a position with Hospital. In her application, Norris listed her former employment with Josephs. Josephs, in response to a telephone inquiry from Hospital, stated that "Norris lacked professional competence." Although Josephs believed that to be a fair assessment of Norris, his adverse rating was based on one episode of malpractice for which he blamed Norris but which in fact was chargeable to another doctor. Because of Josephs's adverse comment on her qualifications, Norris was not employed by Hospital.

If Norris asserts a claim based on defamation against Josephs, will Norris prevail?

(A) Yes, because Josephs was mistaken in the facts on which he based his opinion of Norris's competence.

(B) Yes, because Josephs's statement reflected adversely on Norris's professional competence.

(C) No, if Norris authorized Hospital to make inquiry of her former employer.

(D) No, if Josephs had reasonable grounds for his belief that Norris was not competent.

\section{Question 150}

A 10-lot subdivision was approved by the proper governmental authority. The authority's action was pursuant to a map filed by Diaz, which included an undesignated parcel in addition to the 10 numbered lots. The shape of the undesignated parcel is different and somewhat larger than any one of the numbered lots. Subdivision building restrictions were imposed on "all the lots shown on said map."

Diaz contracts to sell the unnumbered lot, described by metes and bounds, to Butts. Is title to the parcel marketable?

(A) Yes, because the undesignated parcel is not a lot to which the subdivision building restrictions apply. (B) Yes, because the undesignated parcel is not part of the subdivision.

(C) No, because the undesignated parcel has never been approved by the proper governmental authority.

(D) No, because the map leaves it uncertain whether the unnumbered lot is subject to the building restrictions.

\section{Question 151}

On March 15, Venus Viniferous entered into a written agreement with Tipple Winery that provided that Venus would sell 1,600 tons of tokay grapes to Tipple for $\$ 750$ per ton, delivery to be no later than November 1 of the same year. By November 1, Venus had delivered only 700 tons of grapes, and had informed Tipple by telegram that she had used the remainder of her crop in the production of her own boutique winery's latest release, Tokay With Me wine cooler. Tipple purchased an additional 900 tons of tokay grapes from other growers at the thenprevailing market price of $\$ 800$ per ton. Venus has submitted an invoice to the marketing department of Tipple for $\$ 525,000$. The head of marketing has come to you, Tipple's legal officer, for advice on how to respond to this billing.

Ignoring incidental costs of cover, you should advise her to:

(A) Pay the $\$ 525,000$, since by accepting delivery of the 700 tons of grapes Tipple waived an objection to Venus's breach.

(B) Pay Venus the market value of her 700 tons of grapes as of November 1, less the cost of cover for the remaining 900 tons.

(C) Pay Venus $\$ 480,000$, representing the contract price for the grapes she delivered less the cost of cover for the remaining 900 tons.

(D) Pay Venus nothing, since she will be unable to enforce any claim for payment in court. 

\section{Question 152}

Dray was prosecuted for bank robbery. At trial, the bank teller, Wall, was unable to identify Dray, now bearded, as the bank robber. The prosecutor then showed Wall a group of photographs, and Wall testified that she had previously told the prosecutor that the middle picture (concededly a picture of Dray before he grew a beard) was a picture of the bank robber.

Wall's testimony is:

(A) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

(B) Inadmissible, because it is a violation of Dray's right of confrontation.

(C) Admissible as prior identification by the witness.

(D) Admissible as past recollection recorded.

Questions 153-154 are based on the following fact situation:

Barnes had been a beekeeper for many years, making a modest living selling honey in the area surrounding his farm. When he became aware of a sudden demand for beeswax for use in the manufacture of candles and certain types of exotic soaps sold in specialty shops, he built a plant to manufacture these items. The candle and soap business developed so rapidly that Barnes found it profitable to sell his bee farm to Stevens for $\$ 50,000$. The sale contract provided that "Barnes reserves the right to purchase all of the beeswax produced by Stevens during the next five years at the current market price at time of delivery, delivery and payment to be made at weekly intervals, and Stevens agrees to supply in any event a minimum of 100 pounds of beeswax per month during that period."' When the sale was closed, Barnes's lawyer handed Stevens's lawyer a letter stating: "This is to notify you that I will take all of your beeswax production until further notice."' For one year, Stevens delivered to Barnes and Barnes paid for all of the beeswax produced by Stevens. During that year, Stevens, who was an expert beekeeper, increased his beeswax production by $100 \%$ by increasing the number and productivity of the bees. Stevens then proposed to Barnes that, since he had doubled production, it would only be fair that he supply Barnes with half of his new total, but in any event a minimum of 100 pounds per month, leaving Stevens free to sell the remainder of the wax at higher prices for new uses being made of beeswax. Barnes, in a signed writing, agreed to the proposal by Stevens for the remaining period of the original contract. During the following year, Stevens delivered to Barnes, and Barnes paid for, one-half of all of the beeswax produced by Stevens.

As the first year of the new contract ended, Stevens was stung by a bee and, due to an allergy, became so seriously and permanently ill and impaired as to be unable to attend to the bees. From that time on he never made another delivery to Barnes.

153. The modification between Barnes and Stevens reducing the contractual amounts by $50 \%$ was:
(A) Enforceable in all respects.
(B) Enforceable only to the extent of beeswax tendered by Stevens.
(C) Unenforceable, because there was no consideration for Barnes's promise to take only one-half of the production.
(D) Unenforceable, because of the indefi- niteness as to the quantity of the goods. 154. Assuming that contractual obligations existed between Barnes and Stevens, Stevens's refusal to perform was:
(A) Justifiable, because he had not prom- ised to produce any beeswax.
(B) Justifiable, because his performance was excused because of his permanent disability.
(C) Justifiable only if he gave Barnes reasonable notice so that Barnes could buy beeswax elsewhere.
(D) Not justifiable and constituted a breach of contract.

\section{Question 155}

A statute in the state of Peridot permits the state to seize and dispose of real property that was used to commit or facilitate the commission of a felony drug offense. After Keith's arrest for selling cocaine out of his home, a felony, the state instituted an action of forfeiture against Keith's house and property. After notice to Keith and a hearing, a judge granted the order and the state seized the property. Six months later, after the time for any appeals had expired, the property was sold at a public auction to a third party. It was only when the third party brought an action to quiet title that Northwest Bank, the holder of a properly recorded mortgage on Keith's property, learned of the forfeiture. Because the bank's mortgage payments were automatically deducted from an account Keith had under a different name, no one at the bank was aware that the property had been seized. The only notice provided to parties other than Keith was a public notice published for three weeks in a general circulation newspaper. The bank defends the quiet title action on the ground that it did not receive the notice required under the United States Constitution to protect its interest in the property. If the court rules that Northwest Bank's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated by the state's seizure of the property, it will be because:

(A) In any judicial proceeding affecting rights to real property, a claimant is required to provide notice and an evidentiary hearing to all parties with a legal interest in the property before taking actions affecting their rights.

(B) The government itself was the party that seized the property, rather than a private party using governmental processes.

(C) The notice was not adequate under the circumstances to apprise a party with a properly recorded legal interest in the property.

(D) The jurisdiction treats the mortgagee as having title to the property rather than merely a lien. 

\section{Question 156}

Darren's car was stopped by Officer Jones for a minor traffic violation. The officer recognized Darren as a suspect in a multimillion-dollar bank fraud scheme that had just been discovered by the authorities. She placed Darren under arrest and gave him Miranda warnings. She then asked for permission to search the trunk of the car. Darren nodded and unlocked the trunk. Officer Jones searched the trunk and discovered a bag containing what appeared to be cocaine in a compartment in the trunk. When later tests determined that it was cocaine, the authorities added a charge of transporting illegal narcotics to Darren's indictment. At a preliminary hearing, Darren moved to have evidence of the cocaine excluded as the result of a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Should the court grant Darren's motion?

(A) Yes, because one taken into custody cannot give valid consent to a search that would otherwise require a warrant.

(B) Yes, because the search exceeded the scope of a permissible search incident to a lawful arrest.

(C) No, if the court finds that Darren's consent was voluntary under the circumstances.

(D) No, because persons have a lesser expectation of privacy in their vehicles for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.

\section{Question 157}

In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be guilty of the crime charged?

(A) Without the permission of Owner, Defendant takes Owner's car with the intention of driving it three miles to a grocery store and back. Defendant is charged with larceny.

(B) Defendant gets permission to borrow Owner's car for the evening by falsely promising to return it, although he does not intend to do so. Two days later, he changes his mind and returns the car. Defendant is charged with larceny by trick.

(C) Defendant gets permission to borrow Owner's car for the evening by misrepresenting his identity and falsely claiming he has a valid driver's license. He returns the car the next day. Defendant is charged with obtaining property by false pretenses.

(D) With permission, Defendant, promising to return it by 9 p.m., borrows Owner's car. Later in the evening, Defendant decides to keep the car until the next morning and does so. Defendant is charged with embezzlement. Questions 158-159 are based on the following fact situation:

In a trial between Jones and Smith, an issue arose about Smith's ownership of a horse, which had caused damage to Jones's crops.

158. Jones offered to testify that he looked up Smith's telephone number in the directory, called that number, and that a voice answered, "This is Smith speaking." At this, Jones asked, "Was that your horse that tramped across my cornfield this afternoon?" The voice replied, "Yes." The judge should rule the testimony:

(A) Admissible, because the answering speaker's identification of himself, together with the usual accuracy of the telephone directory and transmission system, furnishes sufficient authentication.

(B) Admissible, because judicial notice may be taken of the accuracy of telephone directories.

(C) Inadmissible unless Jones can further testify that he was familiar with Smith's voice and that it was in fact Smith to whom he spoke.

(D) Inadmissible unless Smith has first been asked whether or not the conversation took place and has been given the opportunity to admit, deny, or explain.

159. Jones seeks to introduce in evidence a photograph of his cornfield to depict the nature and extent of the damage done. The judge should rule the photograph:

(A) Admissible if Jones testifies that it fairly and accurately portrays the condition of the cornfield after the damage was done.

(B) Admissible if Jones testifies that the photograph was taken within a week after the alleged occurrence. (C) Inadmissible if Jones fails to call the photographer to testify concerning the circumstances under which the photograph was taken.

(D) Inadmissible if it is possible to describe the damage to the cornfield through direct oral testimony.

\section{Question 160}

Pursuant to a state statute, Clovis applied for tuition assistance to attend the Institute of Liberal Arts. He was qualified for such assistance in every way except that he was a resident alien who did not intend to become a United States citizen.

The state's restriction of such grants to United States citizens or resident aliens seeking such citizenship is probably:

(A) Valid, because aliens are not per se "a discrete and insular minority" specially protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

(B) Valid, because the line drawn by the state for extending aid was reasonably related to a legitimate state interest.

(C) Invalid, because the justifications for this restriction are insufficient to overcome the burden imposed on a state when it uses such an alienage classification.

(D) Invalid, because the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV does not permit such an arbitrary classification. 

\section{Question 161}

Allen and Barker are equal tenants in common of a strip of land 10 feet wide and 100 feet deep which lies between the lots on which their respective homes are situated. Both Allen and Barker need the use of the 10 -foot strip as a driveway; and each fears that a new neighbor might seek partition and leave him with an unusable five-foot strip.

The best measure to solve their problem is:
(A) A covenant against partition.
(B) An indenture granting cross-easements in the undivided half interest of each.
(C) A partition into two separate five-foot-wide strips and an indenture granting cross- easements.
(D) A trust to hold the strip in perpetuity.

\section{Question 162}

In 1956, Silo Cement Company constructed a plant for manufacturing ready-mix concrete in Lakeville. At that time Silo was using bagged cement, which caused little or no dust. In 1970, Petrone bought a home approximately 1,800 feet from the Silo plant. One year ago, Silo stopped using bagged cement and began to receive cement in bulk shipments. Since then at least five truckloads of cement have passed Petrone's house daily. Cement blows off the trucks and into Petrone's house. When the cement arrives at the Silo plant, it is blown by forced air from the trucks into the storage bin. As a consequence, cement dust fills the air surrounding the plant to a distance of 2,000 feet. Petrone's house is the only residence within 2,000 feet of the plant.

If Petrone asserts a claim against Silo based on nuisance, will Petrone prevail?
(A) Yes, unless using bagged cement would substantially increase Silo's costs.
(B) Yes, if the cement dust interfered unreason- ably with the use and enjoyment of Petrone's property.
(C) No, because Silo is not required to change its industrial methods to accommodate the needs of one individual.
(D) No, if Silo's methods are in conformity with those in general use in the industry.

\section{Question 163}
Congress enacts a law providing that all disagreements between the United States and a state over federal grant-in-aid funds shall be settled by the filing of suit in the federal district court in the affected state. "The judgment of that federal court shall be transmitted to the head of the federal agency dispensing such funds, who, if satisfied that the judgment is fair and lawful, shall execute the judgment according to its terms."

This law is:

(A) Constitutional, because disagreements over federal grant-in-aid funds necessarily involve federal questions within the judicial power of the United States.

(B) Constitutional, because the spending of federal monies necessarily includes the authority to provide for the effective settlement of disputes involving them.

(C) Unconstitutional, because it vests authority in the federal court to determine a matter prohibited to it by the Eleventh Amendment.

(D) Unconstitutional, because it vests authority in a federal court to render an advisory opinion. 

\section{Question 164}

In a civil suit by Pine against Decker, Decker called Wall, a chemist, as an expert witness and asked him a number of questions about his education and experience in chemistry. Over Pine's objection that Wall was not shown to be qualified in chemistry, the trial court permitted Wall to testify as to his opinion in response to a hypothetical question.

On cross-examination, Pine asked Wall if he had failed two chemistry courses while doing his graduate work. The answer should be:

(A) Admitted, because it is relevant to the weight to be given Wall's testimony.

(B) Admitted, because specific acts bearing on truthfulness may be inquired about on cross-examination.

(C) Excluded, because the court has determined that Wall is qualified to testify as an expert.

(D) Excluded, because Wall's character has not been put in issue.

\section{Question 165}

Davison was driving through an apartment building area plagued with an unusually high incidence of burglaries and assaults. Acting pursuant to a police department plan to combat crime by the random stopping of automobiles in the area between midnight and 6 a.m., a police officer stopped Davison and asked him for identification. As Davison handed the officer his license, the officer directed a flashlight into the automobile and saw what appeared to be the barrel of a shotgun protruding from under the front seat on the passenger side of the car. The officer ordered Davison from the car, searched him, and discovered marijuana cigarettes and a shotgun.

At Davison's trial for unlawful possession of narcotics, his motion to suppress the use of the marijuana as evidence should be:

(A) Sustained, because the marijuana was discovered as a result of the unlawful stopping of Davison's automobile. (B) Sustained, because the use of the flashlight constituted a search of the interior of Davison's automobile without probable cause.

(C) Denied, because the officer's conduct was consistent with the established police plan.

(D) Denied, because the discovery of the gun in plain view created the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify the arrest and search of Davison.

\section{Question 166}

Hunko, a popular professional wrestler, entered into a written agency contract with Adman, who agreed to try to get Hunko's picture on a variety of food products. Hunko promised that Adman would have the exclusive right to promote Hunko on food product lines. They agreed that Hunko would receive $70 \%$ of the proceeds and Adman would receive $30 \%$. Adman was able to persuade the makers of "Chocolate Charms" breakfast cereal to put Hunko's picture on the cereal boxes. Shortly after Adman confirmed the Chocolate Charms deal with the cereal manufacturer, Hunko and Adman agreed orally that henceforth Hunko would receive $50 \%$ of the proceeds, including proceeds from the Chocolate Charms deal, and Adman would receive the other $50 \%$. Hunko received a $\$ 10,000$ check from Chocolate Charms, and he promptly sent Adman a check for $\$ 3,000$. Adman demanded an additional $\$ 2,000$, but Hunko refused to pay.

If Adman sues Hunko for the $\$ 2,000$, the party likely to prevail is:

(A) Hunko, because of the parol evidence rule.

(B) Adman, because consideration is not required for a modification.

(C) Hunko, because Adman had a preexisting legal duty to secure food product promotions for Hunko.

(D) Hunko, because an exclusive contract requires that the party given the privileges of exclusivity use his best efforts. 

\section{Question 167}

At a time when Ogawa held Lot 1 in the Fairoaks subdivision in fee simple, Vine executed a warranty deed that recited that Vine conveyed Lot 1, Fairoaks, to Purvis. The deed was promptly and duly recorded.

After the recording of the deed from Vine to Purvis, Ogawa conveyed Lot 1 to Vine by a warranty deed that was promptly and duly recorded. Later, Vine conveyed the property to Rand by warranty deed and the deed was promptly and duly recorded. Rand paid the fair market value of Lot 1 and had no knowledge of any claim of Purvis.

In an appropriate action, Rand and Purvis contest title to Lot 1 . In this action, judgment should be for:

(A) Purvis, because Purvis's deed is senior to Rand's.

(B) Rand, because Rand paid value without notice of Purvis's claim.

(C) Purvis or Rand, depending on whether a subsequent grantee is bound, at common law, by the doctrine of estoppel by deed.

(D) Purvis or Rand, depending on whether Purvis's deed is deemed recorded in Rand's chain of title.

\section{Question 168}

Paul sued Dave for making a slanderous statement that greatly embarrassed Paul. Dave denied that he ever made such a statement. At trial, Paul called Willie to the stand, and Willie testified that he heard Dave make the statement on August 4. Dave discredited Willie, and Park offers evidence of Willie's good reputation for truthfulness.

The rehabilitation is most likely to be permitted if the discrediting evidence by Dave was testimony that:

(A) Willie and Paul had known each other since childhood. (B) Willie had been convicted of perjury in an unrelated case.

(C) Willie had attended a school for mentally retarded children.

(D) Willie disliked Dave.

Questions 169-171 are based on the following fact situation:

Poe ordered some merchandise from Store. When the merchandise was delivered, Poe decided that it was not what he had ordered, and he returned it for credit. Store refused to credit Poe's account, continued to bill him, and, after 90 days, turned the account over to Kane, a bill collector, for collection.

Kane called at Poe's house at 7 p.m. on a summer evening while many of Poe's neighbors were seated on their porches. When Poe opened the door, Kane, who was standing just outside the door, raised an electrically amplified bullhorn to his mouth. In a voice that could be heard a block away, Kane called Poe a "deadbeat" and asked him when he intended to pay his bill to Store.

Poe, greatly angered, slammed the door shut. The door struck the bullhorn and jammed it forcibly against Kane's face. As a consequence, Kane lost some of his front teeth.

169. If Poe asserts a claim based on defamation against Kane, will Poe prevail?
(A) Yes, if Kane's remarks were heard by any of Poe's neighbors.
(B) Yes, because Kane's conduct was extreme and outrageous.
(C) No, unless Kane knew that Poe owed no money to Store.
(D) No, unless Poe suffered some special damage. 170. If Poe asserts a claim based on intentional infliction of emotional distress against Kane, will Poe prevail?
(A) Yes, because Kane's conduct was extreme and outrageous.
(B) Yes, because Kane was intruding on Poe's property.
(C) No, unless Poe suffered physical harm.
(D) No, if Poe still owed Store for the merchandise.

171. If Kane asserts a claim based on battery against Poe, will Kane prevail?
(A) Yes, because Poe had not first asked Kane to leave the property.
(B) Yes, if Poe knew that the door was substantially certain to strike the bullhorn.
(C) No, if Kane's conduct triggered Poe's response.
(D) No, because Kane was an intruder on Poe's property.

\section{Question 172}

Rimm and Hill were fooling around with a pistol in Hill's den. Rimm aimed the pistol in Hill's direction and fired three shots slightly to Hill's right. One shot ricocheted off the wall and struck Hill in the back, killing him instantly.

The most serious crime of which Rimm can be convicted is:
(A) Murder.
(B) Voluntary manslaughter.
(C) Involuntary manslaughter.
(D) Assault with a dangerous weapon.

\section{Question 173}

When the latest generation of interactive video games reached the video arcades in State Russet, community groups and civic leaders were alarmed to discover that the most popular games among young teenagers had graphic displays of violence and sexual themes. The state legislature quickly responded to the public outcry. With the stated aim of protecting minors from the perceived evils of offensive but not necessarily obscene materials, the legislature enacted a statute banning the commercial licensing of video arcade games with a specifically defined degree of graphic violent or sexual content.

Delmar, the owner of a chain of video arcades in State Russet shopping malls, was denied licenses for a number of video games that he wanted to install at his arcades. He challenges the state's action in federal district court.

The court will probably find the State Russet statute:

(A) Constitutional, because for materials accessible to minors, the state may adopt a different standard for determining whether the material is offensive or obscene than the standard it applies for adults.

(B) Constitutional, because the statute precisely defines the type of content that is prohibited in the video games.

(C) Unconstitutional, because narrower means are available to deny minors access to the objectionable material without affecting rights of adults.

(D) Unconstitutional, because some of the banned video games may have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, as determined by contemporary community standards, and thus do not fall within the definition of obscenity. 

\section{Question 174}

Dent and Wren were playing golf. After they had completed nine holes, Dent left to make a telephone call. When he returned, he told Wren, "My wife was just involved in an accident. She ran a red light and hit another car. I have to skip the back nine." After arriving at the scene of the accident, Dent, after talking with bystanders, determined that his wife had not driven through a red light. Notch, the driver of the other car, brought suit against Dent's wife for injuries suffered in the accident. To help establish liability, Notch seeks to have Wren testify as to Dent's statements on the golf course.

Wren's testimony is:
(A) Admissible as an admission.
(B) Admissible as a statement against interest.
(C) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
(D) Inadmissible, because it constitutes opin- ion.

\section{Question 175}

Ortega owned Blackacre in fee simple and by his will specifically devised Blackacre as follows: "To my daughter, Eugenia, her heirs and assigns, but if Eugenia dies survived by a husband, a child or children, then to Eugenia's husband during his lifetime with remainder to Eugenia's children, their heirs and assigns. Specifically provided, however, that if Eugenia dies survived by a husband and no child, Blackacre is specifically devised to my nephew, Luis, his heirs and assigns."

While Ortega's will was in probate, Luis quitclaimed all his interest in Blackacre to Eugenia's husband, Jose. Three years later Eugenia died, survived by Jose but no children. Eugenia left a will devising her interest in Blackacre to Jose. The only applicable statute provides that any interest in land is freely alienable.

Luis instituted an appropriate action against Jose to establish title to Blackacre. Judgment should be for:
(A) Luis, because his quitclaim deed did not transfer his after-acquired title.
(B) Luis, because Jose took nothing under Ortega's will.
(C) Jose, because Luis had effectively con- veyed his interest to Jose.
(D) Jose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title applies to a devise by will.

Questions 176-177 are based on the following fact situation:

On June 1, Kravat, a manufacturer of men's neckties, received the following order from Clothier: "Ship 500 two-inch ties, assorted stripes, your catalogue No. V34. Delivery by July $1 . "$

On June 1, Kravat shipped 500 three-inch ties that arrived at Clothier's place of business on June 3. Clothier immediately telegraphed Kravat: "Reject your shipment. Order was for two-inch ties." Clothier, however, did not ship the ties back to Kravat. Kravat replied by telegram: "Will deliver proper ties before July 1." Clothier received this telegram on June 4, but did not reply to it.

On June 30, Kravat tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as item No. V34; but Clothier refused to accept them.

176. Did Clothier properly reject the ties delivered on June 3?
(A) Yes, because the ties were noncon- forming goods.
(B) Yes, because Kravat did not notify Clothier that the ties were shipped as an accommodation to Clothier.
(C) No, because Kravat could accept Clothier's offer by prompt shipment of either conforming or nonconforming goods.
(D) No, because Clothier waived his right to reject the ties by not returning them promptly to Kravat. 177. Did Clothier properly reject the ties tendered on June 30 ?
(A) Yes, because Kravat's shipping the three-inch ties on June 1 was a present breach of contract.
(B) Yes, because Kravat's shipping the three-inch ties on June 1 was an anticipatory repudiation.
(C) No, because Kravat cured the June 1 defective delivery by his tender of conforming goods on June 30.
(D) No, because a contract for the sale of goods can be modified without con- sideration.

\section{Question 178}

Deanna was moving to Russia to work in a foreign policy institute, and was in the process of moving out of the apartment that she had shared with Vanessa, who was not in at the time. Just before leaving, Deanna collected numerous items of hers from Vanessa's room that Vanessa had borrowed, usually without permission. As she was leaving the apartment, she grabbed what she believed to be her laptop computer, which Vanessa had often borrowed to do reports for work. Because it was an older, slower machine, she planned to trade it in for a different model at a computer resale store during a stopover in London. When she arrived at the computer store she discovered that she had taken a brand new, state-of-the-art laptop that Vanessa had apparently just purchased.

Is Deanna guilty of larceny of the computer?

(A) No, because she mistakenly believed that the computer she had picked up was hers.

(B) No, if her mistake as to whose computer she had picked up was reasonable.

(C) Yes, because she intended to permanently deprive Vanessa of the computer when she took it.

(D) Yes, if she decides to keep the computer or trade it in for a different one.

\section{Question 179}

Don Dent was on trial for the murder of Michael Richards. At the trial, Dent put forth the defense of self-defense, claiming that Michael was about to kill him when he shot Michael. To help establish that he was in fear of Michael, Dent called Walter to testify. Walter will testify that he heard Sam Smith say to Dent, "Michael Richards is a mean, vicious killer; he has murdered three people in the past year."

Walter's testimony is:
(A) Admissible under the state of mind excep- tion to the hearsay rule.
(B) Admissible nonhearsay.
(C) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not covered by an exception.
(D) Inadmissible, because it does not help establish that Dent acted in self-defense. 

\section{Question 180}

Lordsville was a small, agricultural village with a population of 400 . It was a quiet, conservative town, and $90 \%$ of the inhabitants belonged to the Lordsville Church of Jesus, a whitewashed frame building located on Lordsville's main street. The Lordsville Village Council consisted of five members, all of whom were members of the Lordsville Church of Jesus. The Council unanimously appropriated $\$ 350$ to pay Mower to mow the lawn of the Lordsville Church of Jesus for a year. Mower was a 15-year-old resident of Lordsville and a member of the Lordsville Church of Jesus whose father had been killed the previous year when he was struck by lightning. Curmudgeon, a Lordsville resident, lived in a tiny house and paid only \$200 per year in village and county property taxes, but he was incensed that any of it should go to support what he called "a bunch of holier-thanthou, superstitious, holy-rollers." Curmudgeon filed suit in federal district court to strike down the Council's appropriation to mow the church lawn.

Should the court entertain Curmudgeon's suit?

(A) No, because Curmudgeon paid so little in taxes that his interest in the matter, if any, is too minimal.

(B) No, because taxpayers lack standing to sue over appropriations by duly constituted legislative bodies.

(C) Yes, because a taxpayer may sue under the authority of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause if a fund into which he has paid is being used for religious purposes.

(D) Yes, because taxpayers have standing to sue when questions involving constitutional rights are at issue.

\section{Question 181}

Acorp and Beeco are companies that each manufacture pesticide $\mathrm{X}$. Their plants are located along the same river. During a specific $24-$ hour period, each plant discharged pesticide into the river. Both plants were operated negligently and such negligence caused the discharge of the pesticide into the river.

Landesmann operated a cattle ranch downstream from the plants of Acorp and Beeco. Landesmann's cattle drank from the river and were poisoned by the pesticide. The amount of the discharge from either plant alone would not have been sufficient to cause any harm to Landesmann's cattle.

If Landesmann asserts a claim against Acorp and Beeco, what, if anything, will Landesmann recover?

(A) Nothing, because neither company discharged enough pesticide to cause harm to Landesmann's cattle.

(B) Nothing, unless Landesmann can establish how much pesticide each plant discharged.

(C) One-half of Landesmann's damages from each company.

(D) The entire amount of Landesmann's damages, jointly and severally, from the two companies. 

\section{Question 182}

For a valuable consideration, Amato, the owner of Riveracre, signed and gave to Barton a duly executed instrument that provided as follows: "The grantor may or may not sell Riveracre during her lifetime, but at her death, or if she earlier decides to sell, the property will be offered to Barton at $\$ 500$ per acre. Barton shall exercise this right, if at all, within 60 days of receipt of said offer to sell." Barton recorded the instrument. The instrument was not valid as a will.

Is Barton's right under the instrument valid?

(A) Yes, because the instrument is recorded.

(B) Yes, because Barton's right to purchase will vest or fail within the period prescribed by the Rule Against Perpetuities.

(C) No, because Barton's right to purchase is a restraint on the owner's power to make a testamentary disposition.

(D) No, because Barton's right to purchase is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.

\section{Question 183}

In a contract suit by Perez against Drake, each of the following is an accepted method of authenticating Drake's signature on a document offered by Perez except:

(A) A nonexpert who, in preparation for trial, has familiarized himself with Drake's usual signature testifies that, in his opinion, the questioned signature is genuine.

(B) The jury, without the assistance of an expert, compares the questioned signature with an admittedly authentic sample of Drake's handwriting.

(C) A witness offers proof that the signature is on a document that has been in existence for at least 20 years, that was in a place where it would likely be if it was authentic, and that has no suspicious circumstances surrounding it.

(D) A witness testifies that Drake admitted that the signature was his. 

\section{Question 184}

The industrial city of Tunbridge suffered from battles over gang turf and a rash of drive-by shootings. Most street gangs were affiliated with one of the two loose gang confederations that fought for dominance, the Assassins and the Ghouls. To "issue a warning" to the Ghouls, a carload of Assassins, armed with Uzi submachine guns, sped into the Ghouls' neighborhood. It was late at night when the car passed a corner store, around which the Ghouls were known to congregate during daylight hours. The Assassins knew that the store closed at 6 p.m. and that the Ghouls went elsewhere after nightfall. As the Assassins drove by, they sprayed the store with submachine gunfire, smashing the windows and pocking the brick exteriors. One of the bullets struck and killed Jamie, a six-yearold girl who was asleep in an apartment located on the second floor, above the corner store. A few days later, the police arrested Dennison, who admitted to being a member of the Assassins and to having been in the car when the Assassins shot up the store. Dennison was placed on trial for the murder of Jamie.

If Dennison takes the stand in his own defense, and the jury believes Dennison's testimony, which of the following assertions by Dennison would be his best defense to the murder charge?
(A) "I was the driver of the car and did not actually shoot into the building."
(B) "I took a lot of drugs that night, and I was so high that I don't even remember the incident; I was certainly in no condition to form an intent to kill somebody."
(C) "Another member of my gang pointed a gun at me. I was really scared that if I didn't shoot into the building I would be seriously injured or killed myself."
(D) "I believed that the building was aban- doned and had no idea that there would be people inside it."

Questions 185-186 are based on the following fact situation:

Orris had title to Brownacre in fee simple. Without Orris's knowledge, Hull entered Brownacre in 1950 and constructed an earthen dam across a watercourse. The earthen dam trapped water that Hull used to water a herd of cattle he owned. After 12 years of possession of Brownacre, Hull gave possession of Brownacre to Burns. At the same time, Hull also purported to transfer his cattle and all his interests in the dam and water to Burns by a document that was sufficient as a bill of sale to transfer personal property but was insufficient as a deed to transfer real property.

One year later, Burns entered into a lease with Orris to lease Brownacre for a period of five years. After the end of the five-year term of the lease, Burns remained on Brownacre for an additional three years and then left Brownacre. At that time Orris conveyed Brownacre by a quitclaim deed to Powell. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years.

185. After Orris's conveyance to Powell, title to Brownacre was in:
(A) Hull.
(B) Orris.
(C) Burns.
(D) Powell. 186. After Orris's conveyance to Powell, title to the earthen dam was in:
(A) The person who then held title to Brownacre in fee simple.
(B) Burns, as purchaser of the dam under the bill of sale.
(C) The person who then owned the water rights as an incident thereto.
(D) Hull, as the builder of the dam.

\section{Question 187}

A statute authorizes a specified federal administrative agency to issue rules governing the distribution of federal grant funds for scientific research. The statute provides that, in issuing those rules, the agency must follow procedures and substantive standards contained in the statute. In a severable provision, the statute also provides that otherwise valid rules issued by the agency under authority delegated to it by this statute may be set aside by a majority vote of a designated standing joint committee of Congress.

The provision of this statute relating to the power of the designated standing joint committee of Congress is:

(A) Constitutional, because it is a necessary and proper means of ensuring that the rules issued by this agency are actually consistent with the will of Congress.

(B) Constitutional, because discretionary money grants authorized by statute are privileges, not rights, and, therefore, Congress has greater freedom to intervene in their administration than it has to intervene in the administration of regulatory laws. (C) Unconstitutional, because it denies equal protection of the laws to members of Congress who are not appointed to the joint legislative committee authorized to set aside rules of this agency.

(D) Unconstitutional, because it authorizes a congressional change of legal rights and obligations by means other than those specified in the Constitution for the enactment of laws.

\section{Question 188}

Johnson and Tenniel owned Brownacre as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Johnson executed a mortgage on Brownacre to Lowden to secure a loan. Subsequently, but before the indebtedness was paid to Lowden, Johnson died intestate with Stokes as her only heir at law. The jurisdiction in which Brownacre is located recognizes the title theory of mortgages.

In an appropriate action, the court should determine that title to Brownacre is vested:

(A) In Tenniel, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.

(B) In Tenniel, free and clear of the mortgage.

(C) Half in Tenniel, free of the mortgage, and half in Stokes subject to the mortgage.

(D) Half in Tenniel and half in Stokes, with both subject to the mortgage. 

\section{Question 189}

In 1980 Omar, the owner in fee simple absolute, conveyed Stoneacre, a five-acre tract of land. The relevant, operative words of the deed conveyed to "Church [a duly organized religious body having power to hold property] for the life of my son, Carl, and from and after the death of my said son, Carl, to all of my grandchildren and their heirs and assigns in equal shares; provided that Church shall use the premises for church purposes only."

In an existing building on Stoneacre, Church immediately began to conduct religious services and other activities normally associated with a church.

In 1995, Church granted to Darin a right to remove sand and gravel from a one-half acre portion of Stoneacre upon the payment of royalty. Darin has regularly removed sand and gravel since 1995 and paid a royalty to Church. Church has continued to conduct religious services and other church activities on Stoneacre.

All four of the living grandchildren of Omar, joined by a guardian ad litem to represent unborn grandchildren, instituted suit against Church and Darin seeking damages for the removal of sand and gravel and an injunction preventing further acts of removal. There is no applicable statute.

Which of the following best describes the likely disposition of this lawsuit?

(A) The plaintiffs should succeed, because the interest of Church terminated with the first removal of sand and gravel.

(B) Church and Darin should be enjoined, and damages should be recovered but impounded for future distribution.

(C) The injunction should be granted, but damages should be denied, because Omar and Carl are not parties to the action.

(D) Damages should be awarded, but the injunction should be denied.

\section{Question 190}

Defendant, a worker in a metal working shop, had long been teasing Vincent, a young colleague, by calling him insulting names and ridiculing him. One day Vincent responded to the teasing by picking up a metal bar and attacking Defendant. Defendant could have escaped from the shop. He parried the blow with his left arm, and with his right hand struck Vincent a blow on his jaw from which the young man died.

What is the most serious offense of which Defendant could be properly convicted?
(A) Involuntary manslaughter.
(B) Voluntary manslaughter.
(C) Murder.
(D) None of the above.

\section{Question 191}

Dean, charged with murder, was present with her attorney at a preliminary examination when White, who was the defendant in a separate prosecution for concealing the body of the murder victim, testified for the prosecution against Dean. When called to testify at Dean's trial, White refused to testify, although ordered to do so.

The prosecution offers evidence of White's testimony at the preliminary examination. The evidence is:
(A) Admissible as former testimony.
(B) Admissible as past recollection recorded.
(C) Inadmissible, because it would violate White's privilege against self-incrimina- tion.
(D) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception. 

\section{Question 192}

The town of Hometown had a municipal auditorium that all groups were permitted to use. Lately, Bhagwan Bigbucks has begun to hold recruiting seminars for his religious cult at the auditorium. Sensing the displeasure of the voting public and fearing that the auditorium would become a mecca of fringe religious groups, the Hometown Town Council adopted the following ordinance: "Effective immediately, no religious groups will be permitted to use the Municipal Auditorium for meetings, speeches, or other public gatherings."

Bigbucks, who was having great success recruiting followers in Hometown, challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance in federal court. His suit should:

(A) Fail, because the ordinance treats all religions equally.

(B) Fail, because continuing to allow religious groups to use the auditorium would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

(C) Succeed, because "religious groups" is an unconstitutionally vague term.

(D) Succeed, unless Hometown can show that the ordinance serves a compelling government interest.

\section{Question 193}

Light Company is the sole distributor of electrical power in City. The company owns and maintains all of the electric poles and equipment in City. Light Company has complied with the National Electrical Safety Code, which establishes minimum requirements for the installation and maintenance of power poles. The Code has been approved by the federal and state governments.

Light Company has had to replace insulators on its poles repeatedly because unknown persons repeatedly shoot at and destroy them. This causes the power lines to fall to the ground. On one of these occasions, Paul, Faber's five-yearold son, wandered out of Faber's yard, intentionally touched a downed wire, and was seriously burned.

If a claim on Paul's behalf is asserted against Light Company, the probable result is that Paul will:

(A) Recover if Light Company could have taken reasonable steps to prevent the lines from falling when the insulators were destroyed.

(B) Recover, because a supplier of electricity is strictly liable in tort.

(C) Not recover unless Light Company failed to exercise reasonable care to stop the destruction of the insulators.

(D) Not recover, because the destruction of the insulators was intentional. 

\section{Question 194}

Santos agreed to sell and Perrine agreed to buy a described lot on which a single-family residence had been built. Under the contract, Santos agreed to convey marketable title subject only to conditions, covenants, and restrictions of record and all applicable zoning laws and ordinances. The lot was subject to a 10 -foot side line setback originally set forth in the developer's duly recorded subdivision plot. The applicable zoning ordinance zones the property for single-family units and requires an 8.5-foot side line setback.

Prior to closing, a survey of the property was made. It revealed that a portion of Santos's house was $8.4$ feet from the side line.

Perrine refused to consummate the transaction on the ground that Santos's title is not marketable. In an appropriate action, Santos seeks specific performance.

Who will prevail in such an action?
(A) Santos, because any suit against Perrine concerning the setback would be frivolous.
(B) Santos, because the setback violation falls within the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex.
(C) Perrine, because any variation, however small, amounts to a breach of contract.
(D) Perrine, because the fact that Perrine may be exposed to litigation is sufficient to make the title unmarketable.

\section{Question 195}

According to a statute of the state of Kiowa, a candidate for state office may have his name placed on the official election ballot only if he files with the appropriate state official a petition containing a specified number of voter signatures. Roderick failed to get his name placed on the state ballot as an independent candidate for governor because he failed to file a petition with the number of voter signatures required by state statute. In a suit against the appropriate state officials in federal district court, Roderick sought an injunction against the petition signature requirement on the ground that it was unconstitutional.

Which of the following, if established, constitutes the strongest argument for Roderick?
(A) Compliance with the petition signature requirement is burdensome.
(B) The objectives of the statute could be satisfactorily achieved by less burdensome means.
(C) Because of the petition signature require- ment, very few independent candidates have ever succeeded in getting on the ballot.
(D) The motivation for the statute was a desire to keep candidates off the ballot if they did not have strong support among voters. 

\section{Question 196}

Alford was a suspect in a homicide committed during a robbery of a liquor store. Barber was a friend of Alford. Police telephoned Barber and asked if he would help locate Alford. Barber agreed and met the police officers at headquarters later that night.

After a discussion during which police asked questions about Alford and the homicide, Barber said that he wanted to get something "off his chest" and advised the officers that he was in on the robbery but that Alford had shot the owner of the store without his permission or prior knowledge. The officers then for the first time gave Barber his Miranda warnings.

Barber was indicted for felony murder. He moved to prevent the introduction of his statement into evidence. His motion should be:

(A) Granted, because Barber was effectively in custody and entitled to receive Miranda warnings at the beginning of the discussion.

(B) Granted, because Barber's right to counsel and due process were violated by the interrogation at police headquarters.

(C) Denied, because his statement was freely and voluntarily given and he was not entitled to Miranda warnings.

(D) Denied, because by visiting headquarters voluntarily, Barber waived his right to have Miranda warnings at the beginning of the discussion.

\section{Question 197}

Astin left her car at Garrison's Garage to have repair work done. After completing the repairs, Garrison took the car out for a test drive and was involved in an accident that caused damages to Placek.

A statute imposes liability on the owner of an automobile for injuries to a third party that are caused by the negligence of any person driving the automobile with the owner's consent. The statute applies to situations of this kind, even if the owner did not specifically authorize the mechanic to test-drive the car.

Placek sued Astin and Garrison jointly for damages arising from the accident. In that action, Astin cross-claims to recover from Garrison the amount of any payment Astin may be required to make to Placek. The trier of fact has determined that the accident was caused solely by negligent driving on Garrison's part, and that Placek's damages were $\$ 100,000$.

In this action, the proper outcome will be that:

(A) Placek should have judgment for $\$ 50,000$ each against Astin and Garrison; Astin should recover nothing from Garrison.

(B) Placek should have judgment for $\$ 100,000$ against Garrison only.

(C) Placek should have judgment for $\$ 100,000$ against Astin and Garrison jointly, and Astin should have judgment against Garrison for $50 \%$ of any amount collected from Astin by Placek.

(D) Placek should have judgment for $\$ 100,000$ against Astin and Garrison jointly, and Astin should have judgment against Garrison for any amount collected from Astin by Placek. Questions 198-199 are based on the following fact situation:

Although by all appearances Herb and Edna, an elderly couple, were destitute, they had, in fact, substantial cash in the bank. Their new neighbors, the Smiths, feeling sorry for them on Thanksgiving, bought a month's supply of food and gave it to Herb and Edna. Later, Edna confided in the Smiths that she and Herb had money and told them that, because they had been so kind, she was leaving them money in her will. All of Herb's and Edna's bank accounts were held in joint tenancy. When Edna died, at the Smiths' request Herb gave the Smiths the following signed instrument: "In consideration of my wife's promise to the Smiths, and their agreement not to sue her estate, I agree to pay them the sum of $\$ 5,000$." When Herb died of a heart attack several days later, the Smiths asked the administrator of his estate to pay them the $\$ 5,000$. The administrator refused on the ground that there was no consideration for the agreement.

198. Besides the consideration stated in Herb's written instrument, what other fact would strengthen the Smiths' claim?
(A) They would have never given the food if they had known Herb and Edna had money.
(B) They believed they could sue Edna's estate.
(C) The majority of the funds in the bank were left to Edna by her parents.
(D) Edna's promise to them was in writ- ing.

199. On which of the following theories would it be most likely that the Smiths would recover?

(A) Herb's written instrument was a binding unilateral contract.

(B) Herb's acceptance of the food was fraudulent.
(C) Herb is bound by promissory estoppel.
(D) Herb and the Smiths entered into a valid compromise.

\section{Question 200}

Vincent was engaged in a telephone conversation with Walter. At one point in the conversation, Vincent said to Walter, "There's my doorbell. Hold the line a minute while I go see who it is." Two minutes later Vincent returned to the phone. He told Walter, "Dornbach is here. I'll have to hang up. Talk to you later." The next morning, Vincent's housekeeper found him dead and obviously the victim of foul play. Dornbach was arrested and charged with Vincent's murder.

The prosecution seeks to have Walter testify at Dornbach's trial as to Walter's telephone conversation with Vincent. The prosecution's attempt is met by an objection from the defense.

How should the court rule on Walter's testimony?
(A) Admissible, as a present sense impression.
(B) Admissible, as evidence of the victim's state of mind.
(C) Admissible, as a prior identification.
(D) Inadmissible, as hearsay not within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.

\section{MULTISTATE PRACTICE EXAM ANALYTICAL ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(C) The court should suppress all of the evidence because it was the fruit of an unlawful arrest. As a general rule, the police must have an arrest warrant to effect an arrest of an individual in his own home. There is no general "emergency" exception to the warrant requirement. While police officers in hot pursuit of a fleeing felon or trying to prevent the destruction of evidence may sometimes make a warrantless search and seizure, the burden is on the government to show that one of those exceptions applies. Here, the police did not arrive at Dennis's house in hot pursuit of Dennis, and there was no indication that Dennis might be destroying the money or other evidence; i.e., there were no circumstances precluding them from keeping the house under surveillance while they obtained a warrant. Hence, the arrest was illegal. Because an arrest constitutes a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, the exclusionary rule applies, and evidence that is the fruit of the unlawful arrest may not be used against the defendant at trial. Here, all of the evidence was seized without a warrant and none of the other exceptions to the warrant requirement are applicable. While the protective sweep that turned up the money and gun probably would have been within the bounds of a search incident to an arrest because the police had reason to believe an armed accomplice was present, the illegality of the arrest makes the search unlawful. Similarly, while the bags of marijuana were discovered in plain view, the police have to be legitimately on the premises for that exception to apply. Thus, (C) is correct; (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(C) Threedee cannot compel Plannah to resume performance. Contracts for personal services are not subject to specific performance notwithstanding the fact that damages might be inadequate or difficult to assess or the services to be performed are unique. The courts reason that specific performance of personal service contracts is tantamount to involuntary servitude and would present enforcement problems. At most, Threedee would be able to obtain an injunction to prevent Plannah from working on another project at the times Plannah agreed to work for Threedee. Thus, (C) is correct and (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because it is irrelevant. Whether specific performance is available at all generally depends on whether the subject matter is unique, but even a contract for unique services cannot be enforced by specific performance. The fact that a party has begun performance is irrelevant. (D) is incorrect because duties involving personal skill and judgment may not be delegated absent consent by the obligee (Threedee). Plannah did not have Threedee's consent and so there was no valid delegation.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(A) Conclusions I. and II. are correct, and III. is incorrect. I. is correct because when contractual duties are delegated, the delegator remains liable on the contract, even if the delegate assumes the duties. The result might be different if the obligee expressly consented to the delegation of duties and released the original obligee (a novation), but that did not happen here. Here, Threedee allowed Drafty to proceed with the design work, but that does not, without more, constitute a novation. II. is also correct. The liability of a delegate turns on whether there has been a mere "delegation" or delegation plus an "assumption of duty." Here the delegate, Drafty, "assumed the duties" by making a promise to perform supported by consideration (i.e., the right to collect Plannah's fees). Thus, the non-delegating party (Threedee) can sue for nonperformance. III. is incorrect because the facts do not describe a "divisible" contract. The rule of divisibility allows a party who has performed one of the units of a divisible contract to claim the agreed upon fee for that unit even though he fails to perform the other units. The three requirements are: (i) performance of each party is divided into two or more parts under the contract; (ii) the number of parts due from each is the same; and (iii) the performance of each part by one party is agreed upon as the corresponding part (quid pro quo) from the other party. [Restatement (Second) of Contracts $\S 266$ ] Here the facts establish none of the three requirements. Hence, Threedee is not indebted to Drafty on this theory. Based on the above, (A) is correct, and (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(D) Telco and Rhodes are liable for the full amount as joint tortfeasors. In cases where there are joint tortfeasors and the injury suffered is not divisible, each tortfeasor will be jointly and severally liable for that injury. The rule of joint and several liability applies even where (as in the case described by the facts) each defendant acted entirely independently. Both defendants were negligent and contributed to the injuries suffered by the plaintiff when the pole fell. (A) is incorrect because Telco's prior negligence has no effect on Rhodes's liability. Her conduct was the direct cause of the foreseeable harmful result of the pole falling; the fact that it did not happen immediately is irrelevant. (B) is incorrect because Rhodes's reckless driving was not a superseding intervening force that would cut off Telco's liability for its original negligence. Because of Telco's negligence, it was foreseeable that the pole would fall. The fact that it was caused by another's reckless conduct, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, does not cut off Telco's liability. $(\mathrm{C})$ is incorrect because there is no basis to divide the plaintiff's injuries as $50 \%$ caused by Telco and $50 \%$ caused by Rhodes.

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(A) Percy will prevail because the employee of the contractor hired by ValuMart left the level in the aisle. The general rule that a principal will not be vicariously liable for the acts of its independent contractor agent is subject to several broad exceptions, including one for duties that are nondelegable because of public policy considerations. One of these duties is the duty of a business to keep its premises safe for customers. Hence, a business would be liable for the negligence of an employee of an independent contractor to the same extent as for the negligence of its own employee. Here, Cora was employed by Contractor, which was hired by ValuMart. Cora breached the duty owed to business invitees such as Percy by leaving the level projecting out into one of the aisles. Percy was injured as a result, so he will prevail in a suit against ValuMart. (B) is incorrect. As part of the duty owed to business invitees, ValuMart employees have a duty to make reasonable inspections of their premises to discover unsafe conditions (such as if a customer had spilled something slippery in an aisle). However, even if they did not have a reasonable time to discover the level, ValuMart is liable because it is responsible for Cora's conduct. (C) is wrong because, as discussed above, ValuMart is liable under these circumstances for the conduct of its independent contractor's employee. (D) is wrong because ValuMart is liable regardless of the knowledge of its employees.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(B) If the federal legislation does not address the issue of preemption, and a problem is uniquely local, the local government is permitted to enact rules more strict than the federal standards. The Court has made it clear that for preemption, either the federal statute must expressly preempt state measures, or its preemptive force must be clear by either "occupying the field" or posing a conflict that makes compliance with both measures impossible. Since the facts do not indicate that the federal measure expressly preempts state regulation, and since neither of the implied preemption conditions are met, (B) is the correct answer and (C) and (D) are incorrect. (A) misstates the facts.

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(B) Congress has addressed the problem of racial discrimination primarily under the commerce power, but the Thirteenth Amendment does contain an enabling clause that would authorize this type of statute because it is not limited to governmental action. [See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union (1989)] While the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment has been applied to the federal government in the same way that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has been applied to states in racial segregation cases, Watson Janitorial is not a government agency and therefore the Fifth Amendment argument would not be very effective, since it is not the government itself that is being accused of discrimination. Thus, (A) and (C) do not offer the best response, since option I. presents a weak case. (D) is incorrect because option IV. misstates the law: there is no general federal police power.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(B) The letter is admissible as substantive evidence as well as for impeachment purposes. For the purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness, a party may show that the witness has, on another occasion, made statements that are inconsistent with some material part of his present testimony. This may be done by first cross-examining the witness as to the prior inconsistent statement that he has made. If the witness denies having made the statement or fails to remember it, the making of the statement may be proved by extrinsic evidence. A proper foundation must be laid by giving the witness an opportunity to explain or deny the statement, and it must be relevant to some issue in the case. Here, Wilson has denied on cross-examination that he wrote the letter to Lee. Amp can then impeach Wilson by offering the letter into evidence. Because Wilson has not been released as a witness, he will have an opportunity to explain or deny the statement, and it is relevant to whether any work was done at Short's home. Because prior inconsistent statements are generally hearsay, they often are admissible only for purposes of impeachment. In this case, however, the statement is admissible as substantive evidence because it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule. Under Rule 803(3), a statement of a declarant's then existing state of mind is admissible as a basis for a circumstantial inference that the declarant acted in accordance with his state of mind. [See also Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hillmon] Wilson's statement that he was going to do electrical work on Short's house is admissible as circumstantial evidence tending to show that he followed through with his plans and did the electrical work, which is what the statement is being offered to establish. In this case, therefore, the letter should be admissible as both substantive and impeachment evidence, making (B) correct and (A) incorrect. (C) is incorrect because the Federal Rules provide that the credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling him. [Fed. R. Evid. 607] (D) is incorrect. The letter is hearsay because it is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted-that Wilson was going to do electrical work on Short's house-as a basis for inferring that Wilson did do the work. However, as discussed above, it falls within the "present state of mind" exception to the hearsay rule.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(A) To prove an attempt, the government must establish that the defendant had a specific intent to commit the crime and committed an act beyond mere preparation for the offense. There can be no attempt, however, if there is no crime on the books to cover either the defendant's behavior or his intended behavior. This is known as the doctrine of legal impossibility. In (A), the defendant could not be found guilty of attempting to purchase Valium without a prescription because it was not illegal to purchase Valium without a prescription. In (B), (C), and (D), the defendant could be held for attempt. In each fact situation, the defendant acted with the specific intent to commit the crime. In (B), the death of the intended victim made it impossible to commit the homicide. In (C), the refusal of the garage owner to be deceived made it impossible to commit false pretenses. In (D), the fact that the property no longer had "stolen" status made it impossible to commit the crime of receiving stolen property. The mistake as to the attendant circumstances in (B) and (D) and the inability to complete the crime in (C) all constitute factual impossibility, which is not a defense to attempt. 

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(B) A regulation will not be upheld if it is overbroad (i.e., if it prohibits substantially more speech than is necessary). If a regulation punishes a substantial amount of protected speech, judged in relation to the regulation's plainly legitimate sweep, the regulation is facially invalid unless a court has limited construction of the regulation so as to remove the threat to constitutionally protected expression. If a criminal law or regulation fails to give persons reasonable notice of what is prohibited, it may violate the Due Process Clause on vagueness grounds. This principle is applied somewhat strictly when First Amendment activity is involved in order to avoid the chilling effect a vague law might have on speech (i.e., if it is unclear what speech is regulated, people might refrain from speech that is permissible for fear that they will be violating the law). The ordinance at issue here is overbroad in banning all street demonstrations of more than 15 people in commercial areas during rush hour. This regulation bans far more speech than is necessary. This regulation is also unduly vague because "rush" hours is apparently not defined in the ordinance. The section of the ordinance referring to certain types of prohibited language is also so vague as to be facially invalid. (A) is incorrect because prior restraints may be imposed on speech in public places if such restraints are granted under narrowly and clearly defined standards. (C) is incorrect because the police have powers to prevent breaches of the peace. (D) is incorrect since the state may interfere with the right of association, where, for example, there is an imminent danger to public health and welfare.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(B) Lentil may begin eviction proceedings at any time. When a tenant continues in possession after the termination of her right to possession, the landlord has two choices of action: he may treat the hold-over tenant as a trespasser and evict her under an unlawful detainer statute, or he may, in his sole discretion, bind the tenant to a new periodic tenancy, in which case the terms and conditions of the expired tenancy apply to the new tenancy. Here, while Lentil accepted the check sent by Truffle, he informed Truffle that he was not electing to bind her to a new tenancy. Lentil may keep the check because he is entitled to rent for the month that Truffle was a hold-over tenant, but at the end of that month he has the right to evict Truffle because no periodic tenancy was created and Truffle's right to possession has terminated. (A) is incorrect because Lentil did not elect to create a periodic tenancy. Furthermore, had he done so, the tenancy would have been a year-toyear tenancy rather than a month-to-month tenancy because it is a commercial lease for more than one year, rather than a residential lease. (C) is incorrect because, as discussed above, Lentil did not elect to create a periodic tenancy when Truffle held over. (D) is incorrect because no tenancy for years is created when a tenant holds over. If the landlord elects to bind the tenant to a new tenancy, it will be a periodic tenancy, regardless of whether the original tenancy was a tenancy for years.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(B) Dirk's motion should be denied because his waiver of his Miranda rights was valid. Even though the prosecution must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a defendant's waiver of his Miranda rights was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, the suspect need not have been informed of all subjects of an interrogation to effect a valid waiver. The police were not required to tell Dirk of Vera's condition. (A) is incorrect because no error was involved. (C) is incorrect for the reasons described in the analysis of option (A), i.e., the police need not inform the subject of all aspects of the interrogation for the waiver to be considered valid. (D) is incorrect because due process requires only that confessions be voluntary, i.e., not the product of official compulsion. Withholding information about the potential seriousness of the offense does not violate due process. 

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(B) Showing West the notes is a proper attempt to refresh her recollection. A witness may use any writing or thing for the purpose of refreshing her present recollection. This is known as "present recollection revived." Under most circumstances she may not read from the writing while she actually testifies because the writing is neither authenticated nor in evidence. Here, the writing was shown to her solely to refresh her recollection and is, therefore, proper. (A) is incorrect because it describes "past recollection recorded," which is a hearsay exception [Fed. R. Evid. $803(5)$ ] allowing the writing itself to be introduced into evidence if a proper foundation is laid for its admissibility. Here there is no attempt to enter the notes into evidence. (C) is incorrect because what the attorney is asking to do does not constitute a traditional "leading question," which generally calls for a "yes" or "no" answer or is framed to suggest the desired answer. Furthermore, the ordinary rules on leading questions may be waived when the witness needs help to respond because of loss of memory. (D) is incorrect because aiding a witness's present recollection has nothing to do with bolstering the witness's credibility (which generally may not be done until the witness has been impeached).

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(C) I. is correct. Buyer has a contract for 100 wheelbarrows; she is not required to accept anything less. II. is also correct. Buyer can accept if she wants less than the full order and hold Seller responsible for damages. III. is also correct. Under the U.C.C., if a valid contract existed, Buyer can accept the entire shipment and sue Seller for damages. If there had been no prior contract and Seller had attempted to accept by shipment, shipment of the "accommodation" units would be a counteroffer and if Buyer accepted them, she could not sue for damages. However, here there was a prior written contract. Thus, since all the statements are correct, (C) is the correct pick, and (A), (B), and (D) are wrong.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(A) Hardsell can collect his lost profits, i.e., the difference between the contract price $(\$ 9,000)$ and what Hardsell paid to purchase the car from the manufacturer. In a contract for the sale of goods, a seller can collect his lost profits when the buyer breaches if the seller cannot be made whole by a subsequent sale of the item contracted for. This occurs where the seller has an unlimited supply of the goods and demand is limited (e.g., a car dealership), because in such a situation, the seller would have been able to sell to the subsequent purchaser anyway. This is known as a lost volume situation, and in such a situation, the U.C.C. allows the seller to sue for his lost profits. Generally, lost profit is measured by the difference between the cost of goods and the contract price, less the seller's saved expenses. (B) is incorrect because it uses the wrong measure for lost profits. The cost of a similar car in the local wholesale market is irrelevant since Hardsell did not purchase the car on the wholesale market, but rather purchased the car from the manufacturer. Hardsell's actual price will be used to determine his lost profit. (C) is incorrect because although Hardsell resold the car, the resale has not made him whole since he could have sold a car to Karbuff anyway. Thus, the resale does not put Hardsell in as good a position as he would have been had Shift performed (the goal of contract remedies). Thus, Hardsell will be allowed to recover his lost profits, as explained above. (D) is incorrect because contracts of adhesion are not unconscionable per se, and there is nothing in the facts to indicate a degree of unconscionability that would render the contract voidable at buyer's option.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(D) The trial court should rule Wirth's testimony inadmissible because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that it will confuse the issues and waste time. Where a witness makes a statement not directly relevant to the issues in the case, the rule against impeachment (other than by cross-examination) on a collateral matter applies to bar the opponent from proving the statement untrue either by extrinsic contradictory facts or by a prior inconsistent statement. The purpose of the rule is to avoid the possibility of unfair surprise, confusion of issues, and undue consumption of time. An issue is considered collateral if it would not be admissible other than to contradict the testimony. Evidence that a person has previously filed similar claims is generally inadmissible to show the invalidity of the present claim. At best, this evidence shows the plaintiff's tendency toward litigation. Unless there is evidence that the previous claim was false, the probative value of such evidence is deemed outweighed by the risk of confusion of the issues. Since the prior suit would not be the subject of proof independent of impeachment, it is a collateral matter, and extrinsic evidence, such as Wirth's testimony, is inadmissible. (A) is wrong because the testimony is not proper impeachment and is inadmissible. Furthermore, this choice states the foundational requirement for introducing a prior inconsistent statement. This is not a prior inconsistent statement and, if the testimony were admissible, the opportunity to explain or deny would not be required. (B) is wrong because the failure to object merely meant that Pike's answer to the question was admitted into evidence; it does not change the fact that the matter is collateral. Since it is a collateral matter, extrinsic evidence will not be permitted. (C) is wrong for two reasons. First, the suit is a fact that exists independently of the court record, and thus, the best evidence rule would not apply. Furthermore, as stated above, extrinsic evidence of any kind is not admissible on a collateral matter; Digger is limited to cross-examination for impeachment in these circumstances.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(D) Jordan is not an accomplice to criminal homicide because intent is required to invoke accomplice liability. To be convicted as an accomplice, a person must have given aid, counsel, or encouragement with the intent that an offense be committed or, in some cases, with knowledge that he was contributing to the commission of a crime. Jordan supplied the apparently benign antibiotic to prevent the possible commission of a crime of homicide rather than to aid or abet the commission of such crime by Hammond. Jordan lacked intent to commit any of the homicide crimes. (A) is incorrect because murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought and Jordan lacked any of the states of mind required to establish malice. (B) is incorrect because voluntary manslaughter involves a killing after adequate provocation, and "unlawful act" involuntary manslaughter requires a killing in the course of a felony or a malum in se misdemeanor. None of these situations is present here. (C) is incorrect because criminal negligence requires negligence of a greater degree than the "reasonable person" standard for torts. Jordan did not reach this degree of negligence by supplying Hammond with the usually harmless antibiotic.

\section{Answer to Question 18}

(A) Hammond is guilty of murder only. Murder requires a killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Hammond planned to kill his wife and proceeded to do so. It is irrelevant that he killed her by injecting her with a drug that is normally harmless rather than with the poison he thought he was injecting. Ignorance or mistake as to a matter of fact will affect criminal guilt only if the defendant did not have the state of mind required for the crime. (B) is incorrect because no legal conspiracy existed. The common law elements of conspiracy are: (i) an agreement between two or more persons, (ii) an intent to enter into an agreement, and (iii) an intent to achieve the objective of the agreement. By this definition, Jordan was not a co-conspirator, and therefore Hammond is not guilty of common law conspiracy because he did not have an agreement with another guilty party. (C) is incorrect because, for reasons given above, Hammond's mistake of fact regarding the substance he was injecting into his wife does not reduce murder to attempted murder. (D) is incorrect for reasons given in the analysis of options (B) and (C).

\section{Answer to Question 19}

(D) The decisive question in this case involves establishing causation in a strict products liability action. A cause of action based on strict liability for products requires: (i) strict duty owed by a commercial supplier; (ii) breach of that duty; (iii) actual and proximate cause; and (iv) damages for a prima facie case. Option (D) goes to the question of actual causation (i.e., whether Abco was the cause-in-fact of Crane's injuries), which is an essential element in strict liability cases. The issue here is whether the court will apply an "enterprise liability" theory (which has been done in negligence cases). In these cases, courts use an alternative causes approach, which shifts the burden of proof to each of the several defendants to establish that its negligence was not the actual cause of plaintiff's injury. (A) is incorrect because res ipsa loquitur, which allows the trier of fact to infer a breach of duty on the part of the defendant, is only applicable in negligence cases. (B) is incorrect because in strict liability cases the supplier can be held liable even if it was unaware of the harm the product could cause. (C) is incorrect because FDA approval would not affect Abco's liability in a strict liability action.

\section{Answer to Question 20}

(B) Shirts is liable for the total amount on privity of contract grounds, and Shoes is liable for $\$ 12,000$ on privity of estate grounds. When a leasehold interest is assigned, the assignor and the landlord are no longer in privity of estate; the assignee is now in privity of estate with the landlord. Hence, each is liable to the other on all covenants in the lease that "run with the land." Here, the agreement to pay a maintenance fee for upkeep of the common areas of the mall is a covenant that runs with the land because it burdens the tenant and benefits the landlord with respect to their interests in the property (i.e., it "touches and concerns" the land). Shoes is therefore liable for the maintenance fees for the 12-month term of its tenancy. However, since Shoes was not in privity of estate prior to the assignment, it is not liable for the $\$ 3,000$ in maintenance fees that Shirts owed; thus, (A) is incorrect. (C) and (D) are incorrect because Shirts continues to be liable for the maintenance fees after the assignment. While the original tenant is no longer in privity of estate with the landlord after assignment, the tenant can still be held liable on its original contractual obligation in the lease, i.e., on privity of contract. This allows the landlord to sue the original tenant where the assignee has disappeared, is judgment-proof, etc. Here, Shirts is liable for the period Shoes occupied the property as well as the period the property was abandoned. Thus, Lightpost has the choice of suing either Shirts (under privity of contract) or Shoes (under privity of estate) for the $\$ 12,000$ in maintenance fees, as provided in choice (B).

\section{Answer to Question 21}

(D) Both Lakeview and Lightpost are liable to Shoes. A landlord's assignment of the rents and reversion interest, such as through a sale of the property, is subject to the same rules as a tenant's assignment of the leasehold interest. The assignee is liable to the tenants for performance of all covenants made by the original landlord in the lease, provided that those covenants touch and concern the land. The burdens of those covenants run with the landlord's estate and become the burdens of the new landlord. The original landlord also remains liable (on privity of contract grounds) on all covenants that he made in the lease. Here, the duty to maintain the parking lot touches and concerns the land because it benefits the tenant and burdens the landlord with respect to their interests in the property. Thus, regardless of who hired the contractor, Lakeview had a duty to ensure that the contractor completed the work, and is liable to Shoes for the costs Shoes

incurred to have the work completed. (B) is incorrect because the fact that Lakeview did not contractually assume Lightpost's obligations does not alter its liability to Shoes under privity of estate principles. Had Lakeview contractually assumed the obligations, Shoes could have also proceeded against Lakeview on a contractual basis as a third-party beneficiary of the assumption agreement. Even without the assumption, Lakeview is liable to Shoes on privity of estate grounds. (C) is wrong because the fact that privity of estate between Lightpost and Shoes was severed by the sale does not alter Lightpost's privity of contract obligations. Because Lightpost made a covenant in the lease to maintain the parking lot, he is contractually obligated to fulfill that covenant regardless of the sale of the property to Lakeview. (A) is incorrect because the failure of Shoes to pay rent does not excuse the prior breach of the covenant to maintain the parking lot. As a general rule, covenants in a lease are independent of each other. Thus, if one party breaches a covenant, the other party can recover damages, but must still perform his promises under the lease. Absent application of constructive eviction, an implied warranty of habitability, or some other statutory provision, Shoes may not have had authority to withhold rent despite the breach of the maintenance covenant, and Lakeview may now have the option to terminate the lease as a result. Even if that were the case, however, both landlords would remain liable to Shoes for the damages incurred from the breach of the maintenance agreement while the lease was in force.

\title{
Answer to Question 22
}

(A) The state may impose a tax on the fiberoptic line. A state tax levied directly against the property or operation of the federal government without the consent of Congress is invalid. However, nondiscriminatory, indirect taxes on the federal government or its property are permissible if they do not unreasonably burden the federal government. Because this tax is not levied directly against the government but rather against the provider of a service that the government is obtaining, and is levied on all communications lines in the state, the tax is valid. The fact that the economic burden of the tax will ultimately be borne by the government under the "cost plus" contract does not invalidate the tax. (B) is wrong because the Tenth Amendment provides that powers not delegated to the United States, nor prohibited to the states, are reserved to the states. This limits Congress's power to regulate the states but does not serve as an independent grant of power to the states. Both the federal government and the state government have the power to tax, but the federal law is supreme in this area. (C) is incorrect because not every state tax that burdens the federal government is invalid. A nondiscriminatory tax on a service provided to the federal government by a private entity does not appear to be an unreasonable burden on the operation of the federal government. (D) is wrong because the fact that interstate commerce is involved does not invalidate the tax. Power over commerce is concurrent, belonging to both the states and the federal government. While federal law is supreme in the area of interstate commerce, state legislation that affects interstate commerce is not automatically invalidated.

\section{Answer to Question 23}

(A) The document should be admitted. Related to the exception to the hearsay rule for public records and other official writings, Federal Rule of Evidence 803(10) provides that evidence in the form of a certification or testimony from the custodian of public records that she has diligently searched and failed to find a record is admissible to prove that a matter was not recorded, or, inferentially, that a matter did not occur. Here, David's status as a licensed psychotherapist would normally be revealed in the records of the department. The document here at issue is admissible, under the foregoing hearsay exception, as a means of proving that David is in fact not licensed. (B) is incorrect because this hearsay exception does not require unavailability of the declarant. (C) is incorrect because, as explained above, the statement of absence from public record forms an exception to the hearsay rule. (D) is incorrect because a public document that has been signed and certified is self-authenticating under Rule 902 ; hence, no testimonial sponsorship for the document is required.

\section{Answer to Question 24}

(C) Page will not recover because she was an unforeseeable plaintiff to whom Dwyer owed no duty. A duty of care is owed only to foreseeable plaintiffs. A trespasser is not a foreseeable plaintiff unless the landowner has discovered her presence or should reasonably know of trespassers who constantly cross over a section of his land. Neither of these situations is indicated by the facts. Thus, Page was an undiscovered trespasser to whom no duty is owed. Dwyer was under no obligation to inspect his premises to determine if trespassers were entering his cabin. (A) is incorrect. Because Dwyer owed no duty to Page, it is irrelevant whether Dwyer knew that the stove was defective. (B) is incorrect for the same reason. Dwyer had no duty to inspect the appliances in his cabin to make it safe for undiscovered trespassers. (D) is incorrect because it mitigates Page's liability for trespass but has no effect on Dwyer's duty to Page.

\section{Answer to Question 25}

(C) Masters's suit will be unsuccessful because he has no right to a hearing here since he has no life, liberty, or property interest at stake. The Due Process Clause requires a hearing only when a life, liberty, or property interest is at stake. Masters clearly is not at risk of losing his life or liberty, and the Supreme Court has made clear that neither is a property interest involved here. To have a property interest in continued government employment, there must be a statute, regulation, contract right, or clear policy that the employee can be dismissed only for cause. Absent such a right to employment, the employee is an at-will employee and may be terminated without a hearing. Here, there was no law, contract, or policy giving Masters a right to a job absent cause for firing him. Therefore, no hearing was required. (A) is incorrect because bills of attainder involve criminal or otherwise punitive measures inflicted without judicial trial. Nothing here indicates that Masters is being punished; rather he is not being retained as an employee. (B) is incorrect because while the Equal Protection Clause prohibits government from discriminating between similarly situated persons unreasonably, where, as here, no fundamental right or suspect or quasi-suspect right is involved, the discriminatory government action will be upheld as long as it is rational. The random hearing policy here could be rational (e.g., it might provide a sufficient sample to ensure that probationary employees are not being terminated for improper reasons); thus, it will be upheld. (D) is incorrect because it is too broad. Not every aspect of state government employment is protected by the Tenth Amendment. [See, e.g., Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985)]

\section{Answer to Question 26}

(A) Marvin will win because the contract is fully enforceable under the U.C.C. Tubing is a good, and so Article 2 of the U.C.C. applies. The contract is for the sale of goods over $\$ 500$ (10,000 linear feet at $\$ 2 /$ foot); so ordinarily section $2-201$ would require a writing. However, section 2-201(3) provides that a writing is not required where the contract is for "specially manufactured" goods not suitable for resale in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller has made a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement. Because the tubing is a custom order of unique specifications and Marvin has begun manufacture, this exception to the U.C.C. Statute of Frauds applies. (B) is incorrect because the contract is fully enforceable. While Marvin is required to mitigate damages, it is entitled to the full range of contract remedies to put it in the position it would have been in had Golde not breached (i.e., benefit of the bargain damages on the entire contract). (C) is incorrect because while it is true that a contract for the sale of goods over $\$ 500$ must ordinarily be evidenced by a signed writing, the "specially manufactured goods" exception (see above) applies here. (D) is incorrect because the parol evidence rule bars admissibility of evidence that varies an integrated writing; here, there is no writing at all.

\section{Answer to Question 27}

(D) The court is not likely to agree to suppress the confession for two reasons: Drake probably has no standing to raise a violation of Trent's Fourth Amendment rights, and even if he did, the confession would not be excluded because it was not the fruit of the Fourth Amendment violation. Under the Fourth Amendment, the police generally can arrest, without a warrant, anyone that they have reasonable grounds to believe has committed a felony. There are two exceptions, however, when a warrant is required: Absent exigent circumstances, the Fourth Amendment requires the police to have a warrant to arrest a person in his own home or to search the premises of a third person for an arrestee. Here, the police had probable cause to arrest Drake and the arrest did not occur in Drake's home. Although the arrest did take place in Trent's home and the police did not obtain a warrant to search Trent's home, this will not help Drake because the warrant requirement for a third person's premises is intended to protect the third person's expectation of privacy; while the search may have violated Trent's Fourth Amendment rights, Trent is not being charged with an offense. The Supreme Court has held that a person can have evidence excluded on Fourth Amendment grounds only if that person's Fourth Amendment rights were violated; a person has no standing to raise a violation of another's Fourth Amendment rights. A person has standing to object to the search of a place only if the person has an ownership or possessory interest in the place searched or is an overnight guest in the place searched. Here, the police entered Trent's home, and the facts indicate that Drake was there only to obtain a forged license. Thus, Drake probably has no standing to raise the Fourth Amendment violation. Furthermore, even if he had standing, his confession could still be used against him. While the exclusionary rule generally provides that evidence obtained or derived from exploitation of illegally obtained evidence must be excluded, the Supreme Court has held that where the police have probable cause to arrest a defendant and improperly arrest him in his home without a warrant, a confession made by the defendant at the police station is admissible because it is not the fruit of the unlawful arrest (since the police could have lawfully arrested the defendant the moment he stepped outside of the house). [New York v. Harris (1990)] Here, even if the arrest were unlawful because of the absence of a warrant, the police had probable cause to arrest Drake and so could have waited until he left Trent's house. Hence, the confession at the police station was not a fruit of the unlawful arrest and should not be suppressed. (A) is wrong because, as discussed above, it is unlikely that Drake can establish that the warrantless entry by itself was a violation of his own reasonable expectation of privacy. (B) is incorrect because the absence of an arrest warrant, even if it would have made the arrest unlawful under the circumstances, would not require suppressing the confession. As discussed above, the confession was not the fruit of the unlawful arrest because the police had probable cause to arrest Drake as soon as he left the house. (C) is wrong because it is irrelevant. The fact that a reliable informant gave them Drake's location, even assuming that it would have helped establish probable cause for searching there, does not excuse the requirement that a magistrate make an independent evaluation of probable cause before issuing a warrant.

\section{Answer to Question 28}

(D) Nora will be able to enforce the restrictive covenant as an equitable servitude. Zoning regulations and restrictive covenants in private deeds are completely separate concepts. Both must be complied with, and neither provides any excuse for violating the other. Thus, a variance from the government regulation does not prevent enforcement of the private covenant. The court will enforce the covenant as an equitable servitude because Nora is seeking an injunction. An equitable servitude is a covenant that, regardless of whether it runs with the land at law, equity will enforce against the assignees of the burdened land who have notice of the covenant. Here, all of the deeds contained the restrictive covenant. There is no indication that Dampier did not have notice of the restriction, and it is both possible and reasonable for him to comply with the restriction at this stage. Privity of estate is not required because the majority of courts enforce the servitude as an equitable interest in the land itself. Hence, Nora will obtain the injunction. (A) is incorrect because, as noted above, zoning regulations and covenants in deeds are completely separate; thus, the zoning regulation would not take precedence over the covenant. The only time a zoning regulation might prevent enforcement of such a covenant is where enforcement would result in a zoning violation (e.g., covenant calls for single family residential housing only, while the land is zoned strictly commercial). (B) is an incorrect statement of law. Equity will impose a hardship, although it will try to balance the hardships between the parties. Here, the hardship on Dampier is not unreasonable because it is possible for him to build a house that complies with the setback restriction and he has not yet dug the foundation for the house he was planning. (C) is incorrect because nothing in the facts indicates that Dampier will be unjustly enriched by building his home in violation of the covenant; e.g., there is no indication that his home or property will be worth more simply because it has a 30 -foot setback rather than a 50 -foot setback.

\section{Answer to Question 29}

(A) Howser will win because Awl's notice constituted an anticipatory repudiation, which can be treated as an immediate and total breach of contract. If a contract is executory on both sides and one party unequivocally notifies the other party that he will not perform when his duty is due, the nonrepudiating party has the option of treating the repudiation as an immediate and total breach and suing for damages. Although the repudiator can retract the repudiation, this must be done before the nonrepudiating party relies on the repudiation. Here, the contract was wholly executory (since neither party had performed) when Awl said that he would not perform at the agreed price. Since Awl's statement was unequivocal, it constitutes an anticipatory repudiation. Thus, Howser was free to find someone to substitute for Awl. Since Howser did find a substitute, he relied on the repudiation and so Awl's attempted revocation was invalid. (B) is incorrect because the difference in price between Awl's demand and Gutter's price is irrelevant. Under the common law, Awl had a contractual duty to perform at the price he agreed to, and his statement that he would not do so constituted an anticipatory repudiation regardless of the price Awl was attempting to obtain. (C) is incorrect because Howser had no duty to inform Awl of the contract with Gutter. The repudiating party is the wrongful party in an anticipatory repudiation situation, and so the law does not impose a duty of notification on the nonrepudiator. If the repudiator suffers harm by his repudiation, it is his own fault. (D) is incorrect because, as stated above, a repudiator can revoke the repudiation only if the nonrepudiating party has not relied on the repudiation. Here, Howser had relied (by hiring Gutter). Thus, it is too late for Awl to revoke the repudiation.

\section{Answer to Question 30}

(D) Howser can recover $\$ 15,000$, the difference between Awl's contract price and the contract price of the substitute performance. In construction contract cases where the builder breaches, the proper measure of damages is the difference between the cost of obtaining substitute performance (i.e., the cost of completion) and the contract price. Here, while Howser actually paid $\$ 25,000$ more than Awl's contract price to have the house built, he was obligated to pay only $\$ 15,000$ more since Gutter had a legal duty to build the house for his contract price and no more. Howser will not be able to recover the $\$ 10,000$ difference because he has a duty to mitigate damages, and paying more than he was actually obligated to pay breaches the duty. (A) and (B) are incorrect because they do not apply the proper measure of damages formula. (C) is incorrect because the "cost of completion" does not include the additional $\$ 10,000$ Howser gave Gutter to save Gutter from having performed the job at a loss. As explained above, Howser was not required to pay Gutter the $\$ 10,000$ to complete the house and Howser's paying the extra amount breaches his duty to mitigate damages. Thus, Howser cannot recover the extra $\$ 10,000$.

\section{Answer to Question 31}

(C) Smith owns Whiteacre because a deed to a nonexistent person is void and conveys no title. Because Benjamin was dead when the deed was delivered, the deed passed nothing and was a nullity. Note that Smith will be required to return the $\$ 75,000$ to Benjamin's estate to avoid unjust enrichment. (A) is wrong because title never passed from Smith. Furthermore, even if it had, it would not have passed even bare legal title to Lenora since she was not a grantee and Smith did not intend to pass title to her. (B) is wrong because Benjamin was killed before the contract was formed. Had he been alive at that time, the contract would have been valid and executory on his death. If a buyer dies after the contract for sale was entered into but before it has been completed, his heirs or devisees can demand a conveyance of the land at the closing. Since Benjamin was dead when the contract was entered into, however, Lenora's agency was no longer valid and there was no contract. (D) is wrong because the term "risk of loss" refers to risk of the property's being destroyed after the contract is signed but before closing. Here, the property was not destroyed. Moreover, there was no valid contract since Benjamin died before the contract was signed. Therefore, the risk of loss is irrelevant.

\section{Answer to Question 32}

(B) The testimony was properly admitted under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. Statements made under the stress of some exciting event and relating to that event are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. (A) is incorrect because the Federal Rules require the maker of a dying declaration to be unavailable for the declaration to be admissible. (C) is incorrect; even though the statement bolsters the credibility of Patricia, it still qualifies as an exception to the hearsay rule and is admissible substantive evidence. (D) is incorrect because it is up to the broad discretion of the trial judge under Federal Rule 403 whether to exclude relevant evidence based on needless presentation of cumulative evidence. There is nothing to indicate that admission of the testimony constituted an abuse of discretion.

\section{Answer to Question 33}

(A) The party in choice (A) is the only one which clearly meets the "injury in fact" requirement for standing. The plaintiff should "have such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to ensure the concrete adversariness that sharpens the presentation of issues." The business will be clearly injured if its customer is required to drastically reduce purchases to comply with the State Green statute. In addition, the fact that the proposed plaintiff is not a citizen of State Green indicates the interstate impact of the State Green legislation. (B) is incorrect, because the corporation's sales are not large enough to fall within the ambit of the State Green statute, so no injury in fact has been suffered. (C) is incorrect because the general rule is that a plaintiff must have standing in his own right, he cannot assert the rights of another to obtain standing, and nothing here indicates that the governor has a concrete stake here. (D) is incorrect because the potential plaintiff's claim is far too tenuous. While the corporation whose bonds the potential plaintiff owns will be subject to the law, it is not likely that the potential plaintiff will suffer any injury since he has no interest in the corporation's profitability (a bondholder does not share in a corporation's profits, but is only entitled to repayment, and since the owner's bonds here are secured, his investment is protected no matter what happens to the corporation). 

\section{Answer to Question 34}

(D) Bert will win because the officer was not privileged to arrest Bert. A police officer is privileged to make an arrest without a warrant for a felony or for a breach of the peace committed in her presence, but not for a misdemeanor not involving a breach of the peace. If the arrest is privileged, the officer may use only that degree of force necessary to effect the arrest, but never deadly force. Here, Bert's offense of jaywalking was a misdemeanor that did not involve a breach of the peace, so the officer did not have a privilege of arrest and committed a battery by grabbing Bert. (A) is incorrect because the fact that Bert struck the officer after she came at him with a baton would not affect her liability for the initial battery. (B) is incorrect because an ordinary misdemeanor cannot be the basis of an arrest even if it is committed in the presence of the officer; it must also constitute a breach of the peace. (C) is incorrect because it is irrelevant whether Bert will be found guilty of jaywalking - the officer was not privileged to arrest Bert for it.

\section{Answer to Question 35}

(B) If the officer was unaware that Ruth was watching, the officer could not have the requisite intent to inflict emotional distress. For intentional infliction of emotional distress based on conduct directed at a third person, recovery is ordinarily limited to plaintiffs who are not only present at the time, but are known by the defendant to be present, so that the mental distress is likely to have been anticipated by the defendant. (A) is not as good an answer, because even if the officer knew the precise relationship between Ruth and Bert, the essential fact of the officer's knowledge of Ruth's presence is not established. (C) and (D) state elements of the tort, but are meaningless without the necessary intent towards Ruth.

\section{Answer to Question 36}

(C) The court should instruct the jury that Dunken is not liable for first degree murder if he did not form the intent to commit the crime of burglary, because a defense to the underlying felony precludes a conviction for felony murder. Voluntary intoxication is a defense to specific intent crimes, such as burglary, if it prevents the defendant from formulating the requisite intent. In the absence of Dunken's liability for burglary, he cannot be convicted of first degree murder based on the facts presented here. (A) is incorrect because voluntary intoxication may be a defense to first degree murder under the circumstances here. $(B)$ is an incorrect statement of law; the intoxication must negate a specific intent for the underlying felony for it to serve as a defense. (D) is incorrect; while premeditated murder is a specific intent crime for which voluntary intoxication may be a defense, nothing in the facts suggests that the charge is based on premeditation. Here, the first degree murder charge is based on commission of a burglary.

\section{Answer to Question 37}

(B) The most serious crime for which Dunken can be convicted is second degree murder, because voluntary intoxication is not a defense to that crime. Under the statute, second degree murder encompasses all murders committed with "malice aforethought." Voluntary intoxication is not a defense to crimes requiring malice, including murder based on malice aforethought. Malice aforethought includes acting with reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life (i.e., an abandoned and malignant heart), and the jury could find that his reckless driving while intoxicated satisfies that standard. (A) is wrong because, regardless of Dunken's intoxication, there is no evidence that Dunken premeditated the victim's killing or was committing one of the enumerated felonies at the time of the victim's death. (C) and (D) are wrong because, while the jury could find Dunken guilty of only involuntary manslaughter based on criminal negligence or unlawful conduct, it could instead find that he was acting with reckless indifference to human life, which would result in a conviction for the more serious offense of second degree murder.

\section{Answer to Question 38}

(B) The property power of Article IV, Section 3 of the federal Constitution is directly on point. The Property Clause contains no express limit on Congress's power to dispose of property owned by the United States. Such property includes all species, such as leasehold interests and electrical energy as well as ordinary realty and personalty. Disposal may include direct competition with private enterprise (such as TVA and the High Grasslands hypothetical) and has never been invalidated on that ground. (A) is incorrect because the General Welfare Clause allows Congress to spend for the general welfare, and here Congress is not spending, but disposing of property. (C) is not as good an answer as (B) because it is not direct. The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, which encompasses any activity that either in itself or in combination with other activities has a substantial economic effect on, or effect on movement in, interstate commerce. When this power is combined with the Necessary and Proper Clause, it might allow Congress to regulate disposition of federal lands in a specified manner, but the property power is much more direct. (D) is incorrect because the Supremacy Clause merely states that federal law takes precedence over conflicting state law, but no state law is involved here. A private company is suing because the federal government is undercutting the company's price.

\section{Answer to Question 39}

(A) The annual is admissible as an adoptive admission of the defendants. Admissions of party opponents are nonhearsay under the Federal Rules $(801(\mathrm{~d})(2))$ and an exception to the hearsay rule under the common law. Furthermore, a party may expressly adopt someone else's statement as his own, thus giving rise to an "adoptive" admission. The manufacturers have done this by referring Peck to the figures in Insulation Manufacturer's Annual Journal as accurate in their response to the interrogatory. The defendant is estopped, at trial, from denying their admissibility. (B) is incorrect because the Journal does not clearly contain entries made in the ordinary course of business. (C) is incorrect because admissions of party opponents are nonhearsay under the Federal Rules. (D) is incorrect because party admissions waive the authentication requirement.

\section{Answer to Question 40}

(C) The agreement between the parties is a type of requirements contract that obligates GM to buy from FGF all of the red cheese that it will sell and obligates FGF to supply GM's needs up to FGF's entire output. GM does not have to buy any FGF red cheese if it acts in good faith. Requirements contracts (a promise by the buyer to buy all of his requirements from the seller, who promises to sell that amount to the buyer) and output contracts (a promise by the seller to sell all of his output to the buyer, who agrees to buy that amount from the seller) are enforceable under section 2-306 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Consideration exists on both sides in these contracts. In a requirements contract, the buyer's consideration is the good faith operation of his business and the promise that he will only buy from the seller; the seller's consideration is the promise to sell at an agreed-upon per unit price whatever the buyer requires. In an output contract, the seller's consideration is the good faith operation of business and the promise to sell the goods only to the buyer, and the buyer's consideration is the promise to buy at an agreed-upon unit price whatever the seller produces. The agreement here is essentially a requirements contract that puts an upper limit on what GM can require-the total output of FGF-and also requires FGF to sell its red cheese only to GM. It is not an output contract because GM is not required to buy all of FGF's output even though it has retained the right to do so. Under the U.C.C., the buyer in a requirements contract is required to conduct his business in good faith and according to commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade so that his requirements will approximate a reasonably foreseeable figure. However, good faith variations from prior requirements are permitted even when the variation may be such as to result in discontinuance. Thus, a shutdown by a requirements buyer for lack of orders may be permissible if the buyer is acting in good faith. [U.C.C. \$2-306, comment 2] In this case, then, choice (C) best states the obligations of the parties: GM is not obligated to buy any red cheese from FGF as long as it acts in good faith, but any red cheese it sells must come from FGF.

\section{Answer to Question 41}

(D) The court should determine that title to Greenacre is one-half in the heirs of Susan, one-quarter in the heirs of Henry, and one-quarter in the heirs of Audrey. Henry and Audrey held the one-half interest in Greenacre as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Thus, had one of them survived, he or she would own the entire one-half interest. The operation of the simultaneous death statute in the jurisdiction, which disposes of property as if each survived, results in their property being distributed as though they were tenants in common; i.e., one-half of their interest passes through Henry's estate as though he survived and one-half of their interest passes through Audrey's estate as though she survived. Susan always held her one-half interest as a tenant in common, so her one-half interest clearly passes to her heirs without any need to resort to the simultaneous death statute. (A) is wrong because Constance effectively conveyed her entire interest in Greenacre to Audrey, Henry, and Susan, and Constance is not the sole heir of the decedents. No consideration is required for a valid conveyance, and both deeds were properly delivered. Acceptance is presumed. (B) is wrong because it ignores Susan's interest. Henry and Audrey never owned the whole of Greenacre; therefore, they cannot pass the whole of Greenacre to their respective heirs. (C) is wrong because it implies that the one-half interest was not effectively conveyed to Susan. The delivery of the deed to Susan's parent during the time that she was a minor is effective delivery. The fact that the deed was not recorded has no effect on its effectiveness.

\section{Answer to Question 42}

(B) The court should find the tax constitutional because it is nondiscriminatory. Nondiscriminatory, indirect taxes on the federal government or its property are permissible if they do not unreasonably burden the federal government. The tax here is a nondiscriminatory "doing business" tax directed at the gross receipts of all business conducted within the state, and there is no indication that the tax unreasonably burdens the transaction of business by the federal government. Hence, the fact that the corporation was acting as a federal contractor will not immunize it from liability for the tax. (A) is incorrect because it is too broad. A state's power over purely intrastate commercial transactions is subject to the Due Process Clause and, where the federal government is involved such as here, the Supremacy Clause. However, the tax here does not violate the Supremacy Clause, as (C) states, because it is not targeted at, nor does it unreasonably burden, the federal government. (D) is incorrect because, even if interstate commerce is involved here, the three factors evaluated by a court in determining whether an undue burden exists (substantial nexus, fair apportionment, and fair relationship) do not appear to be lacking in this case.

\section{Answer to Question 43}

(A) The subpoena should be upheld because the information about hours billed is not within the privilege. There is no privilege regarding a communication that is relevant to an issue of breach of duty by the lawyer to his client or by the client to her lawyer. Thus, the billing data does not fall within the ambit of the privilege. (B) is incorrect because the information here is not covered by the privilege. Furthermore, if the privilege were applicable, Able would be able to invoke the privilege on behalf of his clients. The lawyer's authority to do this is presumed in the absence of any evidence to the contrary. (C) is a correct statement of law, but the work product rule does not apply to these facts. Documents prepared by the lawyer for his own use in prosecuting his client's case are protected by this rule. Time records are not prepared for litigation purposes; they are not related to the substance of the client's case. (D) is incorrect because the other clients are protected by the blacking out of confidential information. Moreover, since the time records are not communications to or from the client and the identity of clients is often not considered to be within the privilege, the billing records of other clients may not be privileged and their consent may not have been necessary even without the deletions.

\section{Answer to Question 44}

(D) The grandchildren take nothing because the purported conveyance to them violates the Rule Against Perpetuities. Under the Rule Against Perpetuities, an interest in property is not valid unless it will vest, if at all, not later than 21 years after a life in being at the creation of the interest. The validity of interests under the Rule is determined at the time the interests are created, taking into account the facts then existing. The "lives in being plus 21 years" period begins to run, and the measuring lives used to show the validity of an interest must be in existence, at that time. The problem in this case is that there is an age contingency beyond age 21 in an open class. The perpetuities period begins to run on the date Torgeson conveyed Fruitacre to Fran. After that date, Diana could have additional children, shortly after which the lives in being (she, Fran, Hubert, Dubert, and Luberta) might all die. The additional children's interest would vest when they reach age 25 , which is more than 21 years after lives in being. (A) is wrong because the interest violates the Rule Against Perpetuities. Except for the Rule, the grandchildren's interest would be classified as contingent remainder. It is contingent because of the condition precedent of their reaching a certain age before taking an interest. (B) is wrong because, even if the Rule Against Perpetuities had not been violated, the grandchildren's interest would not have been vested because their taking was subject to a condition precedent. (C) is wrong because, even if the Rule Against Perpetuities had not been violated, the grandchildren's interest would be a remainder rather than an executory interest. Their interest follows a life estate and as a rule of thumb, remainders always follow life estates. An executory interest is an interest that divests the interest of another, and under these facts, Fran would not have been divested of her interest; she was entitled to retain the property for the remainder of her life.

\section{Answer to Question 45}

(D) The purported contingent remainder to the Sisters of Charity violates the Rule Against Perpetuities and consequently they take nothing. As noted in the above answer, the grandchildren are not certain to reach age 25 (or to die before reaching 25 ) within 21 years after any life in being. Thus, the interest to the grandchildren violates the Rule Against Perpetuities and, hence, any interest being conveyed subsequent in time, such as that to the Sisters of Charity, will automatically violate the Rule Against Perpetuities. Like any other gift, a gift for charitable purposes is void for remoteness if it is contingent upon the happening of an event that may not occur within the perpetuities period. The only exception to this rule is that if there is a gift to a charity, followed by a gift over to another charity upon a possibly remote event, the gift over is valid. Remember, this is a charity-to-charity exception; the Rule Against Perpetuities still applies to dispositions over from an individual to a charity on a remote condition. In this case, there is a disposition over from an individual to a charity on a remote condition in violation of the Rule. (A) is wrong because the interest is void under the Rule Against Perpetuities. If the Rule did not apply, the Sisters of Charity would have a contingent remainder, and (A) would be correct. The grandchildren would have a contingent remainder and the Sisters' interest is contingent on none of the grandchildren attaining age 25 . (B) is incorrect because a vested remainder subject to total divestment arises when: (i) the remainderman is in existence and ascertained, (ii) his interest is not subject to any condition precedent, but (iii) his right to possession and enjoyment is subject to being defeated by the happening of some condition subsequent. The remainder here at all times remains subject to the condition precedent that none of the grandchildren attain age 25 and therefore the remainder can never be vested. Furthermore, there is no condition subsequent that would ever divest the Sisters of Charity of their interest once they acquired such interest. (C) is incorrect because without regard to the Rule, any interest that the Sisters of Charity would ever take would not divest Fran of her life estate. Thus, their interest could not be described as an executory interest.

\section{Answer to Question 46}

(D) The strongest argument against the validity of the state action is that state provision of textbooks to this segregated private school violates the Equal Protection Clause by giving state support to a racially segregated educational process. The practice amounts to significant state involvement in these activities. Note that a party challenging the state involvement here would also have to show a discriminatory motive, because the distribution of textbooks to all public and private schools is neutral on its face. (A) is incorrect because it is nonsensical. Providing textbooks necessarily serves a legitimate educational function; and even if it did not, there is no requirement that a state serve such a function in the exercise of its power to tax and spend. For example, denial by the Internal Revenue Service of tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory religious schools does not violate the Constitution since the governmental interest in ending racial discrimination outweighs the burden on these religious schools. (B) is wrong because a state may aid anyone as long as its acts are not constitutionally prohibited. (C) is incorrect because the Constitution does not forbid any private bias; it only forbids discriminatory state action. To the extent that private discrimination is forbidden under various federal civil rights acts, the source of the prohibition is legislative, not constitutional.

\section{Answer to Question 47}

(C) If it can be shown that there is neither a religious purpose nor an effect on religion, and that there is not excessive entanglement between government and religion, then the government is not involved in an establishment of religion. The fact that private sectarian schools fulfill an important function (A) would not justify a violation of the Establishment of Religion Clause. That religious instruction in private schools is not objectionable $(B)$ is true-but the issue here is whether the government is involved in the establishment of religion, not whether what is being taught is objectionable or unobjectionable. The Free Exercise Clause (D) does not require identical treatment of public and private schools and, furthermore, the relevant issue here involves the Establishment Clause, not the Free Exercise Clause.

\section{Answer to Question 48}

(A) Edgewater probably will be vicariously liable to Parka because Edgar's deviation did not take him outside the scope of the employment relationship. Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer will be vicariously liable for tortious acts committed by its employee if the tortious acts occur within the scope of the employment relationship. What the scope of employment is in a particular case is a question of fact determined by factors such as the specific authorization by the employer, the employee's motivation, and the normal routines of the employee. Ordinarily, an employee heading home after work is no longer within the scope of employment. Here, however, Edgar was required to be "on call" 24 hours a day and was required to drive the company van to his home so that he would be ready to provide emergency service whenever a call would come in. Most likely, then, Edgar was still within the scope of his employment when he was driving the van home. The next issue is whether his deviation from his route home took him outside the scope of his employment. Most courts today consider the foreseeability of the deviation to be the most important factor in determining whether the employee was still within the scope of employment or was on a "frolic" of his own. Thus, minor deviations in time and geographic area from the employer's business are still within the scope of employment because they are foreseeable. Here, Edgar's deviation of a few blocks from his normal route home to pick up some groceries was not a substantial enough departure from his employment purposes so as to be unforeseeable, and therefore Edgewater can be held vicariously liable for Edgar's negligence. (B) is incorrect because Parka can recover even without showing that Edgewater knew of Edgar's potential for negligence. While that might make Edgewater independently liable for its own negligence in allowing Edgar to drive a company van, Edgewater is vicariously liable even without the assumption stated in choice (B). (C) is wrong because, as discussed above, a minor deviation of a few blocks is not considered a "frolic" by most courts unless it is unforeseeable. (D) is incorrect even though it is a true statement as a general rule. While an employee traveling to and from work ordinarily is not acting within the scope of his employment, Edgar was "on call" for his employer under the facts in this question even while he was driving home from work.

\section{Answer to Question 49}

(C) The best defense that Smythe's testimony offers is insanity. Under the M'Naghten test for insanity, defendant must show that (i) a disease of the mind (ii) caused a defect of reason (iii) such that defendant lacked the ability at the time of his actions to either know the wrongfulness of his actions or understand the nature and quality of his actions. Under the A.L.I./Model Penal Code test for insanity, the defendant is entitled to acquittal if the proof shows that he suffered from a mental disease or defect and as a result lacked substantial capacity to either: (i) appreciate the criminality (wrongfulness) of his conduct; or (ii) conform his conduct to the requirements of law. Smythe's testimony indicates insanity under either test. Smythe's hospitalizations indicate a mental disease and his delusion regarding his wife's basement activities indicates a defect of reason and an inability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. (A) is incorrect because Smythe intended to kill his wife; hence, the mens rea required for homicide, malice aforethought, is satisfied. (B) is incorrect because Smythe performed the act that killed his wife. (D) is incorrect because Smythe's belief was not a reasonable one and does not, by itself, establish a defense.

\section{Answer to Question 50}

(B) Scholastica will lose because Rector can raise consent as a complete defense to her libel action. A defamation action at common law required plaintiff to prove (i) defamatory language on defendant's part that is (ii) "of or concerning" the plaintiff, (iii) publication of the defamatory language to a third person, and (iv) damage to the reputation of the plaintiff. (Because the defamation here does not refer to a public figure or involve a matter of public concern, the elements of falsity and fault do not need to be proved.) In this case, Rector uttered a statement to a third person, Loretta, that linked Scholastica to the sale of drugs; this satisfies the first three elements of the prima facie case. Because the statement was libel (uttered in a writing), general damages will be presumed by law; Scholastica does not need to show actual damages from the statement. Hence, Scholastica can establish a prima facie case for libel against Rector. As with all torts, however, consent, whether express or implied, is a complete defense to a defamation action. Implied consent includes apparent consent, which is consent that a reasonable person would infer from plaintiff's conduct. Here, it was reasonable for Rector to infer that Scholastica's dispatch of her lawyer to request the reasons for her dismissal included a consent for Rector to make defamatory statements to the lawyer as long as they related to the reasons for Scholastica's dismissal. Thus, Scholastica impliedly consented to the statement in the letter and will not prevail in her suit against Rector. (A) is incorrect even though Rector should have verified the statement before repeating it. His defense is that Scholastica impliedly consented to the statement rather than that he did not originate the statement. (C) is incorrect because the fact that Rector did not originate the statement does not provide a defense. One who repeats a defamatory statement will be held liable on the same general basis as the primary publisher even though the repeater states the source or makes it clear that he does not believe the defamation. (D) is incorrect because whether Scholastica was dealing in drugs only affects whether Rector can also raise the defense of truth in this defamation action. Rector will win by raising the defense of consent; the fact that Scholastica was not dealing in drugs does not change this result.

\section{Answer to Question 51}

(B) Rose's motion should be denied because a prosecution for conspiracy is distinct from a prosecution for any substantive offense involving the same conduct as the conspiracy. The Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense. The general rule is that two crimes do not constitute the same offense if each crime requires proof of an additional element that the other crime does not require, even though some of the same facts may be necessary to prove both crimes. [Blockburger v. United States (1932)] Furthermore, a prosecution for conspiracy is not barred merely because some of the alleged overt acts of that conspiracy have already been prosecuted. [United States v. Felix (1992)] Here, both the conspiracy charge and the possession charge require proof of an element that the other charge does not; hence, there is no double jeopardy problem with the indictment. (A) is incorrect because it is too broad a statement. The fact that separate statutes are involved does not establish that these are not the "same offense" for purposes of double jeopardy. (C) is incorrect because the "same conduct" test is not currently used by the Supreme Court to evaluate a double jeopardy claim. (D) is incorrect because the question involves defendant's motion to quash an indictment and not her ultimate punishment.

\section{Answer to Question 52}

(B) Where a statutory classification is challenged as violating the Equal Protection Clause, one of three tests is used. If the classification relates to exercise of a fundamental right or is based on a suspect trait, a compelling state interest must justify the classification. If a quasi-suspect classification is involved (i.e., one based on gender or legitimacy), the law will be upheld if it is substantially related to an important government interest. In other cases, the classification is valid if there is a rational basis for the classification. This rational basis test is used for classifications that relate to matters of economics or social welfare. The Midland statute does not infringe on a fundamental right, nor is it based on a suspect or quasi-suspect trait. Thus, it is judged under the rational basis test. (C) is incorrect because the compelling state interest test is inapplicable here. (A) is incorrect because the existence of a protected property interest is a consideration more appropriate to a due process argument than to one based on equal protection. (D) is incorrect because, although interstate travel is a fundamental right subject to the compelling state interest test, not every restriction on the right to cross state lines is an impairment of the right to travel. Prohibiting possession of snipe traps would not penalize or unduly burden the right of interstate travel.

\section{Answer to Question 53}

(D) A valid federal statute or regulation may expressly or impliedly occupy the entire field regulated, so as to preclude even nonconflicting state or local regulation of the same general subject. Here, the federal rule relates to the subject of consumer product safety, while the Midland statute relates to animal conservation. Thus, even if the federal rule is deemed to occupy the entire field that it regulates, that field differs from the field to which the state statute relates. Consequently, there is no preemption. It follows that (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because the mere absence of affirmative authorization for continued state regulation does not establish preemption. (C) is simply an incorrect statement of the law; it is much too broad.

\section{Answer to Question 54}

(B) This videotape, after being properly authenticated, would be considered to be real evidence going to show the intoxicated state of Dryden shortly after he was driving. It would be admitted as relevant because its value would not be substantially outweighed by undue prejudice. (A) is incorrect because the videotape is not being offered to prove the truth of any statements that Dryden made; it is offered to prove only that he was intoxicated. Thus, there is no statement being made that would constitute an admission. (C) is wrong because Dryden is not being asked to give any testimony. Rather, the matter in question is the introduction of real proof. (D) is wrong because a videotape of the defendant at the time in question has nothing to do with specific instances of conduct, which have to do with past actions of the defendant.

\section{Answer to Question 55}

(C) The seller of land is obligated to deliver a title that is free from reasonable doubt either in fact or law. This does not require a perfect title, but rather one that is free from questions which might present an unreasonable risk of litigation. Title is marketable if a reasonably prudent buyer will accept it in the exercise of ordinary prudence. An inability to establish a record chain of title will generally render the title unmarketable. If the seller attempts to rely on adverse possession to show that defects have been cleared, courts traditionally do not favor such an argument, because proof of adverse possession normally rests on oral evidence, which might not be available to the buyer at a later time. Here, although Simmons may have acquired title by adverse possession, Boyd should not be faced with the prospect of having to prove this in court in the future. Thus, (A) is incorrect. (If Simmons had written proof or a quiet title judgment, title would be marketable.) (D) is incorrect because it does not appear that Simmons's conduct amounted to fraud. (B) is nonsensical.

\section{Answer to Question 56}

(D) Susan takes subject to State National Bank's mortgage. A foreclosure sale wipes out all junior mortgages (those that came later in time than the mortgage that was foreclosed) but does not wipe out senior mortgages (those that came earlier). Since State National Bank's mortgage preceded Home Finance's, it is senior and is not wiped out. Susan takes subject to this mortgage. Thus, (B) is wrong. Although Susan is not personally liable on this debt (she did not sign the note, Jane did), she must pay the mortgage or face foreclosure by State National. Since Property Equity Lenders's mortgage came later than Home Finance's, it is junior and is wiped out. Thus, (A) and (C) are wrong. If, after paying the cost of the foreclosure and paying off Home Finance's mortgage, there is money left over from the sale, it will first go to paying off Property Equity Lenders's mortgage. But regardless of whether Property Equity Lenders is paid off or not, Susan takes completely free of this obligation.

\section{Answer to Question 57}

(C) (C) is the least correct statement because a condition subsequent is one the occurrence of which cuts off an already existing absolute duty of performance. Beta's tendering of good title would not cut off Alpha's duty to perform. (A) and (B) are wrong because they are not inaccurate statements. A condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty of immediate performance arises in the other party. When conditions are concurrent as they are here (as discussed below), it can be said that each condition is a condition precedent to the other. (D) is wrong because conditions concurrent are those that are capable of occurring together (which describes Alpha and Beta's relationship regarding the exchange of the farm and the apartment house) and the parties are bound to perform at the same time. In effect, each is a condition precedent to the other.

\section{Answer to Question 58}

(A) (A) is correct for the following reasons: A condition subsequent is one the occurrence of which cuts off an already existing duty of performance. The form of the condition requiring removal of the shed is that of a condition subsequent because, under the language of the contract, failure to do so will cut off Beta's duty to pay the $\$ 1,000$. A condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty of immediate performance arises in the other party. The substance of the shed removal provision is that of a condition precedent because no duty to pay $\$ 1,000$ arises until after Alpha has removed the shed. (B) and (C) are wrong because Beta is not under a duty to pay the $\$ 1,000$ before Alpha is required to remove the shed. (D) is wrong because removal of the shed is a condition precedent to Beta's duty to pay the $\$ 1,000$.

\section{Answer to Question 59}

(C) A land occupier has an affirmative duty to warn or protect children against dangerous artificial conditions on the land. Thus, the best answer to the question is what Cantebury Trails should have done to best protect the children in this factual situation. (B) is thus easily eliminated, since it has nothing to do with this particular issue; regardless of the neighborhood, Cantebury Trails was aware that children played among the buses. (A) is not the best answer because Cantebury Trails must do what is necessary to protect the children, consistent with the business it is operating on the premises. This answer only goes to one narrow possibility of injury. There are many other ways the children could have been injured playing with these abandoned and wrecked buses. Due care could also have required installation of a higher fence or more diligent patrol of the yard. (D) is also not the best answer because the maintenance of the fence is not in issue; the facts indicate that the children were able to climb the fence without problem. Hence, $(\mathrm{C})$ is the best answer because it states a breach of duty in the broadest terms. Donny would be best able to show a breach of duty by proving that Cantebury Trails could have taken precautionary steps to prevent any injury to children who were tempted to come on the premises.

\section{Answer to Question 60}

(B) The record should be admitted because its direct relevance to the ultimate issue of the case outweighs the danger of prejudice against the defendant. (A) is wrong because evidence of this prior conviction would not be admissible as character evidence against Davidson. (C) is wrong because the process leading to conviction is irrelevant. (D) is wrong because an exception to the hearsay rule applies. Federal Rule 803 (22) provides that judgments of felony convictions are admissible in both criminal and civil actions to prove any fact essential to the judgment. Felony convictions are those for which the potential punishment is imprisonment in excess of one year; hence, the hearsay exception applies here. 

\section{Answer to Question 61}

(C) Defendant will not be guilty of burglary in situation (C) because he did not have an intent to commit a felony at the time he entered Victor's house. The elements of burglary as defined by the jurisdiction here are (i) a breaking (ii) and entry (iii) of a dwelling or other building (iv) of another (v) at nighttime (vi) with the intent of committing a felony therein. In situation (C), Defendant entered Victor's house with the intent only to obtain repayment of a debt, which does not satisfy the intent required for larceny. Since Defendant believed he was entitled to take the money as repayment of the debt, he did not intend to permanently deprive Victor of his property. The fact that he later decided to steal the painting will not establish the requisite intent; it must exist at the time of entry for burglary to be established. (A) is wrong because Defendant committed a constructive breaking by gaining entry to the store by means of fraud, and the other elements of burglary are present from the facts. (Note that the fact that he broke out of the store after he committed the felony is irrelevant.) (B) is incorrect because Defendant committed an entry of the premises by reaching his hand through the mail slot. Since he had the intent to commit a felony at that point, he has committed a burglary; his withdrawal is irrelevant. (D) is wrong because Defendant made an entry by inserting an inanimate object (the bullet) into the dwelling by breaking (the window) with the intent to commit a felony (since he knew he did not have authority to use deadly force). Hence, he has committed a burglary.

\section{Answer to Question 62}

(C) The evidence is admissible to show that the tree was on Dow's property. While evidence of repairs made following an accident is generally inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct under Federal Rule 407, such evidence may be introduced to show ownership or control, since a stranger would hardly make repairs. (A) is wrong because while there is such a public policy, in this case a valid exception applies. (B) is wrong because the evidence is not being introduced to show the condition of the tree at the time of the accident. (D) is wrong because Dow's cutting down of the tree cannot be admitted to show the tree was in a rotted condition. This would contravene the policy of the rule, which has the purpose of encouraging people to make such repairs.

\section{Answer to Question 63}

(C) Lane, as the beneficiary of the nonassignment clause, could have taken positive action to avoid the transfer, but by accepting rent from Andrews, he waived his right to avoid the transfer. Talbot has no such right to contest the transfer because he was not the beneficiary of the nonassignment clause. (A) is wrong because one co-tenant generally does not need the consent of other cotenants to assign his interest. Only Lane's consent was necessary under the lease clause. Since Lane waived his right to avoid the transfer, the transfer became valid. (B) is wrong because the right to enforce this lease provision was waived by Lane. (D) is wrong because nonassignment clauses in leases are valid. They are not considered to be void restraints on alienation.

\section{Answer to Question 64}

(D) The judge should overrule the objection because lay opinion is permissible (and often essential) to identify handwriting. A foundation must first be laid to establish familiarity with the handwriting. (A) is wrong because expert testimony is not necessary to identify handwriting. (B) is incorrect because only a proper foundation is required for the admission of testimony identifying handwriting. The fact that there are other individuals who may be more familiar with or in more recent contact with the handwriting does not, of itself, preclude admissibility of the teacher's testimony. The fact that the teacher has not seen John's handwriting for 10 years goes to the credibility of her testimony but not to its admissibility. (C) is wrong because expert testimony is not required for handwriting identification and, therefore, the witness need not be qualified as an expert.

\section{Answer to Question 65}

(A) Wanda will prevail on a theory of intentional infliction of emotional distress. To establish liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the defendants must have intended to cause severe emotional distress (i.e., either acted with the goal of bringing about such distress or knew with substantial certainty that such distress would result from their conduct). It is also sufficient if the defendants acted recklessly, i.e., in deliberate disregard of a high probability that their conduct would cause emotional distress. Here, Grandmaw and Grandpaw caused Wanda to spend four years not knowing where her young son was. Grandmaw and Grandpaw acted in deliberate disregard of the high probability that a mother would be severely distressed by being kept from her child, not knowing whether he was safe or even alive. (A) correctly states the requisite intent for this tort. (B) is incorrect because, as explained above, it is not required that defendant actually know that the conduct would cause severe emotional distress. (C) is incorrect because it is not necessary to prove physical injuries to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress. (D) is incorrect because the "zone of danger" is more appropriately used in determining liability for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Here, Wanda has a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

\section{Answer to Question 66}

(B) The general rule is that people do not have standing as taxpayers to challenge the way tax dollars are spent because their interest is too remote. However, there is an exception to the general rule. A federal taxpayer has standing to challenge federal appropriations and spending measures if she can establish that the challenged measure: (i) was enacted under Congress's taxing and spending power; and (ii) exceeds some specific limitation on the power. To date, the only limit that the Supreme Court has found on the taxing power is the Establishment Clause. Here, Allen's challenge is based upon such an Establishment Clause matter. Hence, the exception applies and (B) is correct. (A) is incorrect because it is overbroad. Only spending falling within the exception described above may be challenged by taxpayers. (C) is incorrect because sufficient "nexus" is a concept applied to state taxation of interstate commerce-a state can tax only those persons with a sufficient relationship to the state. Here, the complaint is not that Allen is being taxed, but that the tax money is being spent in violation of the Constitution. (D) is wrong. First, state action is involved-the government is giving money for textbooks. Second, standing depends on whether the party has a concrete stake in the outcome of the litigation and is not dependent on whether the action complained of is state action.

\section{Answer to Question 67}

(D) The salary supplements probably will be held unconstitutional. The controlling case in this area is Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), which determined that supplements to salaries of teachers in religious school raised "excessive entanglement" problems. The current Establishment Clause test is that the government program must: (i) have a secular purpose; (ii) have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion; and (iii) not produce excessive government entanglement with religion. The instant case raises both "primary purpose" and, from the policing of the restriction on use of the funds, "entanglement" problems. Option (D) goes most directly to the issue in question and is, therefore, correct. (A) is incorrect because it does not consider the "entanglement" problems of the "no religious instruction" restriction. The answer given in option (A) goes only to the "secular purpose" issue. (B) is incorrect because: (i) no "free exercise" issues are involved here; and (ii) distinguishing between public and private schools avoids Establishment Clause problems. (C) is incorrect because the facts do not indicate disproportionality. Even if disproportionality can be assumed, the courts have elected to invalidate similar laws on the basis of the three-pronged test discussed above rather than couching the issues in terms of "sect preference."

\section{Answer to Question 68}

(A) The Supreme Court applies the Establishment Clause prohibitions less strictly when the benefited institution is a religiously affiliated college or hospital rather than a grade or secondary school. The Court will uphold a government grant of aid to such a college or hospital as long as the government program requires that the aid be used only for nonreligious purposes and the recipient so agrees in good faith. Option (A) most nearly approximates this test and is, therefore, correct. (B), on the other hand, is incorrect because it is overbroad. "Bricks and mortar" may not be used, e.g., to build a college chapel. (C) is incorrect because it is overbroad in another direction. Certain grants (e.g., state-approved textbooks, transportation to and from school, expenses of compiling state-required data) have been allowed even for grade and secondary schools. (D) is incorrect because the Supreme Court has found that no excessive entanglement is involved when government funds are used to build "secular" buildings at colleges and universities.

\section{Answer to Question 69}

(D) An offer must be accepted within a reasonable time. Eureka's reply letter constituted an offer to sell 24 LBVCs for $\$ 39.99$. Gourmet accepted this offer by a memo plus full performance. If this occurred within a reasonable time, a contract was formed. (A) is incorrect because contracts may be formed by nonmerchants. (B) is incorrect because the contract would have already been formed by Gourmet's acceptance; it is irrelevant whether Eureka has enough stock on hand. (C) is incorrect because Eureka's offer called for prompt acceptance and so did not constitute a firm offer, which must be kept open for a reasonable time, not to exceed three months.

\section{Answer to Question 70}

(C) If Eureka's original reply was not an offer, then Gourmet's sending the check and memo would have been an offer and Eureka's shipment of the LBVCs would have been an acceptance. The acceptance would have included terms altering the offer (the no resale provision), but under the U.C.C., between merchants such terms generally become part of the contract. Thus, Gourmet could be held liable for breaching the no resale provision. (A) is wrong because under Article 2 , the status of Eureka does not change the result. (B) is wrong because if the invoice by Eureka was a material alteration, Eureka would not prevail. (D) is incorrect because the phrase "not available in stores" is not sufficient to restrict subsequent resale. It merely indicates that the LBVCs were not currently available in stores.

\section{Answer to Question 71}

(D) A strict liability offense does not require awareness of all of the factors constituting the crime. Strict liability offenses are generally part of a regulatory scheme. They generally involve a relatively low penalty. Here, (A) and (B) are incorrect because the offenses described do not appear to be part of a regulatory scheme. Also, they appear to require awareness of all of the factors constituting the crime; i.e., a defendant probably could not be convicted under (A) without an awareness that he was shoplifting, and a defendant probably could not be convicted under (B) without an awareness that he possessed heroin. (C) presents a closer question. The offense described in (C) appears to be part of a scheme to regulate firearms. The offense described in (D) is part of a scheme to regulate the sale of milk for the purpose of protecting the public from the threat of consumption of tainted milk. Such statutes, in protecting the public health and safety, almost always provide for culpability, regardless of the seller's knowledge of the tainted nature of the product. Also, the statute in (D) describes a misdemeanor, meaning that a violation thereof carries a lesser penalty than does violation of the felony statute in (C). Consequently, because (D) fits more closely the classic concept of a strict liability offense, it is a better answer than (C).

\section{Answer to Question 72}

(A) Most courts impose upon a landowner the duty to exercise ordinary care to avoid reasonably foreseeable risk of harm to children caused by artificial conditions on his property. Under the general rule, the plaintiff must show: (i) that there is a dangerous condition present on the land that the owner is (or should be) aware of; (ii) that the owner knows or should know that young persons frequent the vicinity of this dangerous condition; (iii) that the condition is likely to cause injury because of the child's inability to appreciate the risk; and (iv) that the expense of remedying the situation is slight compared to the magnitude of the risk. If the sprinkler head was a hazard that Peter would probably not discover, it would meet the requirements for a showing of attractive nuisance, and O'Neill would be liable. (B) is incorrect because O'Neill would continue to be responsible even if he had objected to the children playing on the common area. (C) is incorrect because it is of no consequence where Peter lived. (D) is incorrect because there is a higher standard of care where attractive nuisances to children are concerned.

\section{Answer to Question 73}

(B) A state may require that those enrolled to vote be bona fide residents of the community. However, any law regulating the right of persons over age 18 to vote must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling interest. (A) is incorrect because a state does have a compelling interest in the integrity of the voting process that will support narrowly tailored restrictions. (C) is incorrect because whether persons have attained the age of majority has nothing to do with their status as bona fide residents. (D) is incorrect because there does not appear to be any discriminatory effect on interstate commerce. (B) is correct because it is the only answer that recognizes that the state may limit ballot access to actual residents, albeit with safeguards against over-inclusiveness; e.g., the state should provide means by which the students can show that they are bona fide residents.

\section{Answer to Question 74}

(C) Perry is entitled to the proceeds of the sale because under the doctrine of equitable conversion a deceased seller's interest generally passes as personal property. If the seller dies, "bare" legal title passes to the takers of his real property, but they must give up the title to the buyer when the contract closes. When the purchase price is paid, the money passes as personal property to those who take the seller's personal property (unless the seller specifically devises the land in question to a devisee). Thus, Perry, as the personal property devisee, is entitled to the proceeds of the sale. (A) is incorrect as a matter of law. A real estate contract survives the death of either party unless the agreement itself provides otherwise. (B) is wrong because the doctrine of equitable conversion came into play as soon as the contract of sale was signed. (D) is wrong because marketable title is title reasonably free from doubt. Generally, this involves either defects in the chain of title or encumbrances that might present an unreasonable risk of litigation. Such problems are not present in these facts.

\section{Answer to Question 75}

(A) Buyer's heir may specifically enforce the agreement. Under the doctrine of equitable conversion and principles applicable in most states, if the buyer dies, the takers of his real property can demand a conveyance of the land at the closing of the contract. (B) is incorrect because the death of either Seller or Buyer does not render the agreement cancellable at the will of either party. (C) is wrong because a real estate contract survives the death of either party unless the agreement itself provides otherwise. (D) is wrong because marketable title is title reasonably free from doubt. Generally, this involves either defects in the chain of title or encumbrances that might present an unreasonable risk of litigation. Such problems are not present in these facts.

\section{Answer to Question 76}

(D) By process of elimination: (A) is not the best answer because it cannot be determined whether the eyewitness was under the influence of the exciting event when he spoke to the police, and there are multiple levels of hearsay involved. (B) suffers from the same defects. (C) is wrong because inability to cure an error by jury instruction is not a valid reason for denying a motion to strike. Therefore, (D) must be the best answer-since Dellacourt's counsel was being argumentative, and asked how the witness knew a certain fact, the specific response to counsel's question might be admitted as precisely what counsel asked for.

\section{Answer to Question 77}

(A) In a strict liability action, the plaintiff must prove that a product was so defective that it is unreasonably dangerous. The defect causing the harm must have existed when the product left the defendant's control. The defendant must be a commercial supplier of the product in question. Brake failure on a bicycle is an unreasonably dangerous defect. If this defect existed when the bicycle left the factory of Cycle Company, then Roth has a viable cause of action sounding in strict liability against Bike Shop, a supplier in the distributive chain. Thus, (A) is correct. (B) is wrong because it implies absolute liability, not strict liability; i.e., Bike Shop is not liable simply because the brakes failed. It must be established that the brakes were defective when placed in commerce. $(\mathrm{C})$ is wrong because, in jurisdictions retaining traditional contributory negligence rules, ordinary contributory negligence does not bar recovery in strict liability cases where the plaintiff fails to discover the defect or to take steps to guard against its existence. (D) is wrong because a careful inspection would be relevant to a negligence action, but not to one based on strict liability.

\section{Answer to Question 78}

(B) To prevail on a negligence claim, Perez must show negligent conduct by Cycle Company, leading to the supplying of a defective product by the company. (B) is the correct answer because the failure to exercise reasonable care is a major element in a negligence action. (A) is wrong because simply placing a defective bicycle into the stream of commerce would present grounds for a strict liability action, but not one for negligence. Some negligence must be shown. (C) is wrong because privity is not required. The duty of due care is owed to any foreseeable plaintiff. (D) is wrong because any negligence on the part of Roth is reasonably foreseeable and will not relieve Cycle Company of the consequences of its negligence. 

\section{Answer to Question 79}

(B) Manslaughter will not serve as the underlying felony in a felony murder prosecution. The felony murder rule can be applied only where the underlying felony is independent of the killing. With a felony such as manslaughter, there is ordinarily no intent to commit a felony independent of the killing itself; hence, felony murder does not apply. In contrast, the other crimes listed would satisfy the requirement that the defendant intend to commit an underlying felony. One who is guilty of arson (choice A) would have intended that a burning take place. Attempted rape (choice C) requires the intent to perform an act which, if achieved, would constitute rape. Burglary (choice D) requires intent to commit a felony at time of entry.

\section{Answer to Question 80}

(C) Williams's testimony is hearsay, because it relates to a statement made by the driver, while not testifying at the trial, and it is offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted; i.e., that the blue convertible was involved in the hit-and-run accident. (B) is incorrect because the fact that the driver's statement came 10 minutes after the accident probably indicates that the statement was not made close enough to the time of receipt of the sense impression to qualify for the present sense impression exception. (A) is incorrect because there is no "recent perception" exception to the hearsay rule. (D) is incorrect because the evidence is very probative and would not be excluded as prejudicial simply because its receipt in evidence would disadvantage the defendant Dorry.

\section{Answer to Question 81}

(D) Claret is not an intended beneficiary of the contract between Bouquet and Vintage. Although Claret was mentioned in the contract, it seems clear that Bouquet and Vintage did not intend to confer any benefits or rights on Claret. Rather, the parties seem to have been simply expressing a preference as to the distributor of the wine, with no indication that the validity of the contract depended on use of Claret as the distributor. (A) is incorrect because Vintage was contractually bound to perform only with regard to Bouquet, rather than to Claret. (B) is incorrect because Bouquet and Vintage could not foresee that Claret would act in reliance on a contract that conferred no rights on him. (C) is incorrect because an express agreement between Bouquet and Vintage would not have been necessary to a determination that Claret had some rights under the contract. For example, if Claret stood in such a relationship to Bouquet that one could infer that Bouquet wished to make an agreement for his benefit, then it would be more likely that the contract was primarily for the benefit of Claret. (D) is the best answer because the key factor is that Bouquet and Vintage were simply protecting their own interests, with no thought of conferring a benefit upon Claret.

\section{Answer to Question 82}

(C) The only theory under which Amicusbank can recover Bouquet's share of the profits is that Amicusbank is an assignee of Bouquet's rights. (D) would not provide a strong defense for Vintage, because it is clear that Amicusbank was not an intended beneficiary of the BouquetVintage contract. (A) is incorrect because there is no presumption that an assignment is invalid absent express authorization in the contract. (B) is incorrect because, even if Bouquet and Vintage are partners, Bouquet would still be able to assign his rights to profits. (C) is the best answer, because Amicusbank's only hope of prevailing is for it to be considered an assignee of Bouquet's rights. It appears that the written instrument executed by Bouquet lacks the present words of assignment necessary to manifest the intent of the assignor to transfer his rights under the contract completely and immediately to the assignee. The instrument merely allows Amicusbank to collect the debt from Bouquet's share of the profits. Thus, Vintage has a fairly strong argument that Amicusbank is not an assignee of Bouquet's rights under the BouquetVintage contract.

\section{Answer to Question 83}

(A) A contractual duty may not be delegated if performance by the delegate will materially change the obligee's expectancy under the contract. Here, substitution of Agribiz, a company with no experience in the wine-grape business, for Vintage, an established entity in the business, greatly decreases the probable profits which will accrue to Bouquet, the obligee. Thus, a court should rule that the attempted delegation by Vintage of its duty to grow grapes for the venture is invalid. It follows that (C) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because a delegation can be effective absent a contractual provision authorizing the same. (D) is incorrect because, although Vintage certainly must delegate duties to its individual employees, here it is attempting to delegate duties to an entirely different company, one with no experience or reputation in the industry.

\section{Answer to Question 84}

(A) In defamation actions involving a private person plaintiff and a defamatory statement relating to a matter of public concern, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted, if not with malice, then at least negligently. This principle applies where the defamatory potential of the statement was apparent. Here, Miller is a private person plaintiff. His application for transfer of a liquor license, as the subject of public hearing held by a governmental entity, is a matter of public concern. The defamatory potential of Hammond's accusations of Miller's underworld connections is apparent. Therefore, Hammond must have, at the very least, been negligent for Miller to recover; i.e., no strict liability. (A) reflects this fact. (B) is incorrect because Miller's reputation could have been damaged even if his application were granted. (C) is incorrect because it implies liability without fault, simply because a false statement was made. (D) is incorrect because, even if Hammond's appearance was voluntary, there still must be a showing of fault.

\section{Answer to Question 85}

(C) Actual possession of property held in concurrent ownership by one concurrent owner for the statutory adverse possession period will not be sufficient to give that possessor title to the whole estate to the exclusion of his co-tenant, unless there has been an ouster. Here, Arthur occupied Goodacre under unity of possession with Celia. Thus, his possession is not adverse to that of Celia and (A) is incorrect. (D) is incorrect because, had Arthur ousted Celia prior to possessing the land for the required period, he could claim title to all of Goodacre because his possession would have been adverse. (B) is incorrect because the facts do not indicate that Celia intended to renounce her rights in the property.

\section{Answer to Question 86}

(A) The choice to testify will be Wanda's. In federal court, one spouse may testify against the other in a criminal case, with or without the consent of the party-spouse. Thus, the witness-spouse may not be compelled to testify, but neither may she be foreclosed from testifying (except as to a confidential communication made between the spouses while they were husband and wife). Here, Wanda is being asked to testify about a meeting in which her husband participated that took place before her marriage to David. Thus, the privilege for confidential marital communications is inapplicable, making (C) incorrect. Of (A), (B), and (D), only (A) reflects the fact that Wanda may not be compelled to testify, nor may she be foreclosed from testifying.

\section{Answer to Question 87}

(C) The motion to dismiss should be denied. For purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, two crimes do not constitute the "same offense" if each crime requires proof of an additional element that the other crime does not require, even though some of the same facts may be necessary to prove both crimes. Here, even though the same facts are involved for both crimes, the robbery charge requires proof of a taking by force but not a death, while the murder charge requires proof of a death but not of a taking of property. Thus, (C) is correct and (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because armed robbery is not a lesser included offense of premeditated murder. (D) is incorrect because the prosecution would be estopped if violation of one statute constituted a lesser included offense of the other statute.

\section{Answer to Question 88}

(B) Under Article I, Section 8, Congress may spend to "provide for the common defense and general welfare," which means, in effect, that spending may be for any public purpose. Furthermore, the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to make all laws appropriate for carrying into execution any power granted to any branch of the federal government. The power to require that the weapons system be purchased falls within this rubric. Furthermore, the President has no constitutional authority to "impound" (i.e., refuse to spend) funds whose expenditures Congress has expressly mandated. (A) is incorrect as a matter of law. Whether a bill is passed with the President's signature or over his veto is not relevant to the question of whether spending is permissive or mandatory. $(C)$ is incorrect because even though the President's powers do not expressly refer to spending, the President has extensive military powers as commander in chief that could include spending for military necessities in the event of actual hostilities against the United States. (D) is wrong because, in the event of actual hostilities, the President, as commander in chief of the armed forces and militia, could exercise his inherent power to allocate funds. There is also some case law implying that the President has some inherent powers, even in internal affairs, to meet national emergency needs.

\section{Answer to Question 89}

(B) Potts can testify as to any first-hand knowledge he has and need not rely on any written records if he presently remembers the facts. First-hand knowledge is considered to be reliable testimony. (A) is wrong because the records themselves are not being introduced. (C) is wrong because the best evidence rule applies only in situations where the content of the writing is in issue. Here, Potts is testifying about facts he perceived; facts that exist apart from the writing. The notebooks merely describe what Potts saw and knows personally. (D) is wrong because no such summary is sought to be introduced, and even if it were, (D) is an incorrect statement of the law.

\section{Answer to Question 90}

(B) Testimony obtained by a promise of immunity is by definition coerced and therefore involuntary. Thus, immunized testimony may not be used for impeachment of the defendant's testimony at trial. Simmons's testimony will not be permitted to be used against Taylor because it resulted from Taylor's immunized testimony. (A) is wrong because it is an inaccurate statement of the law. Prosecutors can bargain away the rights of co-defendants. (C) is wrong because police suspicion is not the equivalent of actual testimony. (D) is wrong. Even though a witness wants to testify, various privileges such as lawyer/client, doctor/patient, etc., may bar the testimony. Here, the grant of immunity to Taylor is a bar to Simmons's derived testimony because use immunity bars use of one's testimony or anything derived from it.

\section{Answer to Question 91}

(C) Dino owed to a foreseeable plaintiff a general duty to behave as a reasonable person would under the same or similar circumstances. If, upon noticing that the car was once again pulling to the left when braking, Dino should have been on notice that further operation of the car was dangerous, then he should have had the car towed to the repair shop. Continuing to drive the car with knowledge of an attendant danger would create an unreasonable risk of injury to people such as Pedestrian, and would constitute a breach of Dino's duty of care. However, Dino had no reason to know of the dangerous underlying problem (the defective master cylinder), and he had been assured by Dealer's mechanic that the car was safe to drive. (A) is incorrect because Dino had been assured by Dealer's mechanic that a recurrence of the problem would not result in total brake failure. Thus, Dino had a reasonable belief that he could safely drive the car to Dealer. (B) is incorrect because Dino's duty to maintain his car's brakes does not make him strictly liable for a brake failure. Dino reasonably relied on the advice of Dealer's mechanic in believing that the car was safe to drive. It is true that, as (D) states, Dino had diligently had his brakes repaired, but if he had reason to know, subsequent to the repairs, that the brakes were dangerous, he should not have driven the car. Because Dino reasonably relied on the advice of Dealer's mechanic, Dino had no reason to know of the danger involved in continuing to drive the car. Thus, (C) is a better answer than (D).

\section{Answer to Question 92}

(B) To hold Belchfire, a manufacturer, strictly liable for a defect in the car, the car must have reached the consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it was supplied. If the master cylinder was defective when the car left Belchfire's control, then Belchfire has produced a product that is so defective as to be unreasonably dangerous. This defective product actually and proximately caused Pedestrian's personal injuries, and so Belchfire will be liable. (A) is wrong because, unlike (B), it ignores the requirement that the defect be attributable to the manufacturer. (C) is wrong because Pedestrian's strict liability action is based on failure of the master cylinder. The facts do not establish that the mechanic's readjustment of the brakes effected any alteration in the master cylinder. Thus, the work performed on the brakes does not preclude the success of Pedestrian's action against Belchfire. (D) is wrong because a history of brake defects would show that Belchfire should have had notice of the problem. Such notice would be relevant to a negligence action, but not to an action for strict liability.

\section{Answer to Question 93}

(C) While inspecting and repairing Dino's car, Dealer's mechanic owed a general duty of due care to Dino and to any other foreseeable plaintiff. If a reasonably competent mechanic would have discovered the defective cylinder while inspecting and repairing the brakes, then Dealer's mechanic breached the duty of due care by failing to discover the defective cylinder. This breach of duty caused injury to Pedestrian, a foreseeable plaintiff. Dealer would be vicariously liable, under the doctrine of respondeat superior, for the negligence of his employee, the mechanic. (C) is correct because it recognizes that Dealer's liability in negligence hinges on whether the mechanic should have discovered the defective master cylinder. (B) is incorrect because it ignores the possibility that the mechanic should not have been expected to discover the defective cylinder while seeking to remedy the problem originally complained of by Dino. (A) is incorrect because merely selling the car with an unreasonably dangerous defect, without knowing or being expected to know of the defect, will not subject Dealer to liability for negligence. The statement in (A) is more appropriate in an action based on strict liability. (D) is incorrect because, absent any reason to believe that Belchfire is not a reputable manufacturer, Dealer is not liable for Belchfire's negligence.

\section{Answer to Question 94}

(A) Gaint is seeking to enforce the covenant by means of an equitable remedy. Thus, this question concerns an equitable servitude. An equitable servitude relates to a promise that touches and concerns the land. A covenant touches and concerns the land when it makes the land itself more useful or valuable to the benefited party. Here, an agreement to purchase electrical power only from a specified source probably does not touch and concern the land. (B) is incorrect because a common development scheme is not necessary for an equitable servitude. (C) is incorrect because the covenant here does not restrain alienation. (D) is incorrect because privity of estate is not required for enforcement of an equitable servitude, and in any event, privity is present here.

\section{Answer to Question 95}

(B) The Supreme Court has specifically upheld requirements that public employees take an oath to "support the Constitution of the United States" and the state constitution [Connell v. Higgenbotham (1971)] and that state employees take an oath "to oppose the overthrow of the government . . by force, violence, or by an illegal or unconstitutional method." [Cole v. Richardson (1972)] The Court held that such oaths merely required the takers "to commit themselves to live by the processes of our system." (B) is, therefore, correct because it reflects these Supreme Court precedents involving loyalty oaths. (A) is incorrect because the Supreme Court has moved away from the old privilege vs. right analysis, and, in any case, there is no justification based upon "privilege" that would permit oaths that are overbroad or vague, resulting in a chilling effect on First Amendment activities. (C) is wrong because it is overbroad. States may not infringe on First Amendment rights in employment. (D) is wrong. It is doubtful that a college instructor position would be considered to be a position of governmental trust.

\section{Answer to Question 96}

(B) Homey will only be able to recover his actual damages; the liquidated damages clause is unenforceable because it constitutes a penalty. A liquidated damages clause will be enforced only if: (i) damages in case of breach were difficult to ascertain at the time the contract was made, and (ii) the amount agreed upon was a reasonable approximation of what the damages would be. The liquidated damages clause here fails the second test. The facts indicate that Homey knew that he would not be moving into the new house until November. Thus, there is no reason for assuming that Structo's late performance would cause any damages until November. The $\$ 500$ a day late fee during October can thus only be viewed as a penalty. Therefore, the liquidated damages clause will be unenforceable and Homey will be able to collect only actual damages. (C) is incorrect because there was no valid waiver here. For a waiver of rights to be valid, one must at least know of the rights being waived. Here, Homey did not know of Structo's late performance when Homey paid. Thus, the payment cannot constitute a waiver of Homey's rights arising from the late performance. (D) is incorrect-there was no enforceable modification here-because of the parol evidence rule. The parol evidence rule prohibits a party to a written contract from bringing into court evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral communications that seek to vary the terms of the written contract. Here, the oral statement was made before the written contract was signed, and the evidence seeks to vary the completion date provided in the written contract. This will not be allowed under the parol evidence rule. Thus, Structo will not be able to bring in evidence seeking to vary the written date.

\section{Answer to Question 97}

(A) Structo will win because the condition of the architect's certificate will be excused by Bilevel's bad faith. While the issuance of the certificate was an express condition precedent to Homey's duty to pay, the condition will be excused by Homey's hindrance. If a party having a duty of performance that is subject to a condition wrongfully prevents the condition from occurring, the condition will be excused. Here, Homey's duty of payment was subject to the condition precedent that Bilevel issue a certificate of approval, and Homey wrongfully hindered the occurrence of the condition by agreeing to allow Bilevel to not issue the certificate for an improper reasonStructo had done all that it was obliged to do under the contract properly and the only reason for refusing the certificate is that Bilevel and Homey believe the price Homey agreed to is now too high. This is not a valid reason for withholding the certificate. Thus, the condition of the certificate will be excused and Structo can collect the full $\$ 40,000$. (B) is incorrect because, as explained above, the condition of the architect's certificate will be excused. Thus, the contract is fully enforceable. (C) and (D) are incorrect because, as explained above, the contract is fully enforceable. Thus, Homey will have to pay the contract price. It is not a defense that the price is higher than it should have been at current prices.

\section{Answer to Question 98}

(D) The entry into Desmond's apartment and his arrest, without a warrant, probable cause, or circumstances permitting an exception from these requirements, were illegal. The statements he made thereafter were fruits of the original illegality and must be suppressed unless the taint was purged. The giving of Miranda warnings was not sufficient. Hence, (D) is the best answer. If probable cause for a warrant is based on information from an informer, usually that informer's identity need not be revealed. Thus, (A) is incorrect. (B) is a misstatement of law. There was no interrogation by the police to trigger the Miranda requirements. (C) is attractive but not as accurate an answer as (D). If the police had been acting with probable cause to arrest, their forced entry into the apartment would not have made Desmond's statements involuntary.

\section{Answer to Question 99}

(D) Don can introduce all of the items of character evidence as part of his defense. The general rule is that evidence of character to prove the conduct of a person in the litigated event is not admissible in a civil case. However, when a person's character itself is one of the issues in the case, character evidence is not only admissible, but in fact is the best method of proving the issue. Where the plaintiff brings a defamation action for injury to reputation and the defendant pleads as an affirmative defense that his statements were true, plaintiff's character is directly at issue in the case. Under the Federal Rules, any of the types of evidence (reputation, opinion, or specific acts) may be used to prove character when character is directly in issue. [Fed. R. Evid. 405 (b)] Here, William's character is at issue and Don is offering character evidence to show that his assertion that the mayor is corrupt is a true statement. Item I. is evidence of a specific act that demonstrates the mayor's character for corruption; Item II. is testimony regarding the mayor's general reputation in the state as a corrupt politician; and Item III. is opinion testimony about the mayor's corrupt character. All of these items of evidence are admissible; hence, (D) is the correct choice. 

\section{Answer to Question 100}

(B) Purr will be entitled to obtain specific performance. If the vendor of land cannot give marketable title but the purchaser wishes to proceed with the transaction, the purchaser can usually obtain specific performance with an abatement of the purchase price in an amount representing the title defect. Here, Kuzz's legitimate claim to $1 / 10$ of the property constituted a defect that would make title unmarketable. The title defect was cured by Purr at a cost of $\$ 10,000$. Thus, an abatement will be applied to the purchase price. The certified check for $\$ 140,000$ in choice (B) represents the purchase price $(\$ 160,000)$ less the earnest money already paid $(\$ 10,000)$ less the abatement to obtain marketable title $(\$ 10,000)$, leaving the amount to be tendered as $\$ 140,000$. (A) is wrong because either the abatement or the earnest money is not taken into account with that figure. (C) is wrong because Purr acted reasonably in clearing the title defect himself. The rule that a buyer must notify a seller of title defects is intended to prevent the buyer from avoiding the closing by raising a title defect problem at the last minute. Here, Purr was trying to facilitate the closing by resolving the title problem himself, which he did. Prior notice to Venn was not necessary in this case. (D) is wrong because the action is based on a contract that was signed before any potential co-tenancy occurred, and there is no rule that precludes a co-tenant from obtaining specific performance from another co-tenant on an otherwise valid contract.

\section{Answer to Question 101}

(D) Egbert prevails if he believed the truth of the assertion. Charles is a candidate for public office and, as such, to recover he must establish (i) falsity, and (ii) "actual malice"-i.e., knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity. Thus, if Egbert honestly believed the truth of his statement, Charles could not show actual malice, and Egbert would prevail. (A) is wrong because it goes to malice in the sense of "ill will." That type of malice is not the standard for defamation; it is irrelevant that defendant wanted to "get even" with Charles. (B) is wrong because a showing of negligence is not sufficient to recover for defamation of a public official or figure; knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity is required. (C) is wrong because even if the story is a matter of public concern, Charles might still prevail if he can show fault on the part of Egbert-such as Egbert's reckless disregard for whether the statement was true.

\section{Answer to Question 102}

(D) Mathews will not be convicted of an attempt to violate the statute if her employee did not have the requisite intent. Although the statute has been interpreted to create a strict liability crime, which does not require proof of criminal intent, to attempt a strict liability crime requires proof that the defendant acted with the intent to bring about the proscribed result. Therefore, for Mathews to be charged vicariously with attempt, her employee must have acted with the requisite intent; he must have intended to sell the ammunition to a minor. If he did not so intend, Mathews will not be convicted of attempt. (A) is incorrect because this is a case of factual impossibility, which is not a defense to attempt. (B) is incorrect because careful instructions will not, in and of themselves, absolve an employer from vicarious liability. (C) is incorrect because the strict liability elements of the underlying offense make it clear that knowledge of the age of the purchaser is not an element of the underlying offense. Thus, the clerk (and Mathews) can be liable for selling ammunition to a minor no matter how old the purchaser looked or how old he claimed to be. Duncan's lie may have bearing on the clerk's lack of intent, but this is not as direct an answer as (D).

\section{Answer to Question 103}

(B) Where a dispute exists as to the meaning of a written agreement's terms, parol evidence can be received to aid the fact finder in reaching a correct interpretation of the agreement. The Uniform Commercial Code, which governs the contract here, follows the modern approach that permits evidence of interpretation even when the terms are not patently ambiguous. [See U.C.C. $\$ 2-202$, comment 1] Here, the terms may be explained by the previous course of dealing between the parties, because it suggests that the parties understood that specifying "Yellow Giant" in the contract did not mean that a Yellow Giant was being ordered. In addition, the fact that the purchase price for the "Yellow Giant" is $\$ 25,000$ more than the going price for a Yellow Giant creates enough uncertainty to warrant admission of testimony explaining what the parties meant by the term "Yellow Giant." While Cruncher will have the burden of proving that the term meant something different from what it appears to mean, any evidence it offers will be considered by the trier of fact. (A) is incorrect because reformation is generally available only when a writing incorrectly reflects a valid antecedent agreement, such as where a mistake was made in transcribing the agreement. Here, the writing correctly reflects the antecedent agreement, since the parties agreed to use the words "Yellow Giant"; the problem now lies in determining what was meant by "Yellow Giant." Also, this answer overconfidently states the outcome of the controversy, since Technix may have evidence of its own contradicting Cruncher's. (C) is incorrect on these facts because the president is seeking to explain, not contradict, the terms of the written contract. Before it can be determined that testimony is being offered to contradict the terms of a written agreement, the meaning of the terms must be resolved. Thus, the parol evidence rule does not bar admission of this testimony. (D) is incorrect because the requirements of the Statute of Frauds [U.C.C. §2-201] are satisfied here. The U.C.C. requires only (i) a writing sufficient to indicate that a contract was formed, (ii) a quantity term, and (iii) the signature of the party to be charged. All other terms of the contract, including the meaning of a contract term, can be established by parol evidence without implicating the Statute of Frauds.

\section{Answer to Question 104}

(A) The licensing requirement is constitutional. The state may "within the proper purpose of the exercise of its police powers" require licensing of anyone who deals with the public in general, and the Supreme Court has particularly been very liberal when the state is attempting legislation that is remedial in effect to cure a social evil that exists within the state. (B) is incorrect because the designation of the attorney general does not affect the constitutionality. (C) is wrong because this is a permissible burden (if it is one at all). (D) is wrong because there is no indication that the state is treating nonresident garment makers differently than those residing in the state. (Note also that the Interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause does not protect corporations.)

\section{Answer to Question 105}

(A) It is unlikely that this provision could survive even the traditional rationality test. There is no apparent rational relationship between the classifications of citizens and noncitizens, and particularly residents and nonresidents, and the proper state purpose of discouraging the hiring of illegal aliens. Furthermore, state alienage classifications are suspect and will be upheld only if necessary to promote a compelling state interest. The classification in this case is not necessary because there are less burdensome means available to accomplish the state's purpose. (B) is wrong because the Fourteenth Amendment Privileges and Immunities Clause is limited to rights arising out of national citizenship. (Note that the durational residence requirement, but not the United States citizenship requirement, may violate the Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause.) (C) is wrong because the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies only to federal government action. (D) is wrong because the Tenth Amendment reserves power to the states; it does not include restrictions on state power. 

\section{Answer to Question 106}

(B) The Bible listing is admissible as a family record. Federal Rule of Evidence 803(13) provides a specific exception to the hearsay rule allowing admission of family records, such as family Bibles, genealogies, engravings, etc. A family Bible with a record of births and deaths is exactly the type of document intended by this exception. (A) is incorrect because the inscription concerning Baggs's niece is less than 20 years old. (C) is incorrect because the hearsay exception described above applies to the family Bible. (D) is incorrect because there is no such foundational requirement in the exception to the hearsay rule. The family Bible is considered to have inherent indicia of trustworthiness. The Bible has been properly identified as having belonged to Baggs's family, and there is no reason to consider the inscription untrustworthy.

\section{Answer to Question 107}

(D) Mark and Martha each own an undivided one-half interest because the Statute of Frauds applies. The Statute of Frauds requires that any transfer of an interest in land be in writing. The right of survivorship Taylor and Scott tried to create by their oral agreement is an interest in land. As such, it must be in writing to be enforceable. Furthermore, to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the unities of time, title, interest, and possession must be present; i.e., a tenancy in common cannot be converted to joint tenancy by agreement. Therefore, Taylor and Scott remained tenants in common at their deaths, with each undivided one-half interest passing through their respective estates. (A) is incorrect because reliance on a mistake of law cannot convert a tenancy in common to a joint tenancy, and for Martha to take the entire interest, Scott would have to have a right of survivorship. (B) is incorrect because, as discussed above, Scott and Taylor's mistake as to the operation of law is an insufficient basis to reform the deed. A joint tenancy is not created without the four unities and the use of the specific language required by the jurisdiction. (C) is incorrect because the deaths of Scott and Taylor resulting from the same accident is irrelevant. The deaths were not simultaneous and it would not have mattered if they were. The share of each tenant in common goes to each tenant's heirs, and death resulting from the same accident or simultaneous death would not entitle the other co-tenant to take as if he or she had survived because a tenancy in common is involved.

\section{Answer to Question 108}

(D) The state must demonstrate that the requirement is necessary to advance a compelling state interest. The Equal Protection Clause requires that similarly situated persons not be discriminated against unreasonably. Where a suspect class is involved, it is unreasonable to discriminate unless the government can show that the discrimination is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest. As to state government regulation, alienage is a suspect class. Thus, (D) is correct. (A) is incorrect because it states the wrong test (rational basis). (B) is incorrect because it places the burden on the wrong party (the alien). (C) is incorrect because it states the wrong test (rational basis). This test applies only to laws restricting alien participation in the functioning of the state government.

\section{Answer to Question 109}

(A) The only proposition that must be established is that the gas caused Nyman's death. The storage of highly toxic gas is an activity for which strict liability is imposed. Proposition I. relates to an element required in a strict liability case, while propositions II. and III. relate to additional matters that might be necessary to prove if negligence were the issue. In strict liability the plaintiff need only prove: (i) the existence of an absolute duty on the part of the defendant to make safe; (ii) breach of that duty; (iii) that such breach was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury; and (iv) damages. Ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous activities fall into the strict liability category because they: (i) involve risk of serious harm to persons or property; (ii) cannot be performed without risk of serious harm no matter how much care is taken; and (iii) are not commonly engaged-in activities in the community. The storage of toxic gas is such an ultrahazardous activity. Nyman's personal representative need only prove that the escaping toxic gas was the cause of Nyman's death. It follows that (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect because they state propositions that need not be proved for the plaintiff to recover in a strict liability case.

\section{Answer to Question 110}

(C) The strongest argument for admission of Pullen's testimony concerning the telephone call is that, after hearing Denison speak in chambers, Pullen recognized Denison's voice as that of the person on the telephone. Aural voice identification is not a subject of expert testimony; i.e., lay opinion is sufficient. Familiarity with the voice may be acquired before or after the speaking that is the subject of the identification. Thus, the fact that Pullen became familiar with Denison's voice later, in the judge's chambers, does not disqualify the identification. That identification, coupled with Denison's self-identification during the call, is sufficient to authenticate the telephone conversation. (A) and (B) are wrong because they state requirements for identifying the person called, not the caller. (D) is wrong because self-identification of the caller is insufficient evidence of identity; additional evidence of identity, such as the testimony in $(\mathrm{C})$, is required.

\section{Answer to Question 111}

(B) Drake can be guilty of arson because his failure to put out the fire that he started establishes the malice necessary for arson. Arson at common law consists of the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. All that malice requires is that defendant have acted with the intent or knowledge that the structure would burn, or with reckless disregard of an obvious risk that the structure would burn. Here, it is not enough that Drake accidentally or negligently caused the fire to start. However, since he was the cause of the fire, he had a duty to take reasonable steps to try to prevent it from spreading. His failure to do anything when the fire was probably small enough to put out would suffice as reckless disregard of an obvious risk that the building would burn, which it did. With regard to the dwelling requirement, most states extend the crime of arson to structures other than dwellings, and questions on the MBE testing on other arson issues will often assume without saying that the jurisdiction's arson law applies to other buildings. The requirement that the building be "of another" pertains to possession rather than ownership. Thus, a landlord could be guilty of arson for burning down his own building if his tenants were in possession of it rather than him; hence, (D) is incorrect. (A) is wrong because the malice requirement is not established by the fact that Drake harbored ill will against Teague, and there is no "felony arson" doctrine comparable to the felony murder doctrine. (C) is wrong because, as discussed above, Drake need not have intended to start the building on fire; all that need be shown is a reckless disregard of an obvious risk that the structure would burn.

\section{Answer to Question 112}

(A) Dietz should be found guilty of robbery because his accomplice obtained the wallet by means of force. Robbery consists of (i) a taking (ii) of personal property of another (iii) from the other's person or presence (iv) by force or intimidation (v) with the intent to permanently deprive him of it. Thus, robbery is basically an aggravated form of larceny in which the taking is accomplished by force or threats of force. The force must be used either to gain possession of the property or to retain possession immediately after such possession has been accomplished, but the defendant need not have intended to use force to complete the crime; the only intent required is the intent to permanently deprive the victim of his property. Here, Dietz and Atkins had such an intent, and they were able to carry out that intent in part because Atkins slashed Verner's hand with the knife, incapacitating him. The fact that he did not intend to injure Verner is irrelevant; hence, (C) is wrong. (B) is wrong because Verner's erroneous belief that he was being threatened does not establish the element of threat or intimidation. Dietz's conduct was merely an attempt to distract Verner and did not constitute a threat or intimidation; the fact that Verner's intoxication caused him to believe otherwise does not change that result. (D) is incorrect because the unreasonableness of Verner's belief does not change the fact that Dietz is liable as an accomplice to the robbery by Atkins, since robbery (the use of force) was a foreseeable consequence of the pickpocketing.

\section{Answer to Question 113}

(A) David will probably be required to pay Peterson $\$ 105$ under an implied-in-fact contract. An implied-in-fact contract is a contract formed by manifestations of assent other than oral or written language, i.e., by conduct. Even if there is no subjective "meeting of the minds," the parties will be bound if their conduct objectively appears to manifest a contractual intent. Where an offeree silently takes the benefit of offered services with reasonable opportunity to reject them and reason to know that they were offered with the expectation of compensation, the offeree's inaction may constitute an acceptance. [Rest. 2d Contracts $\S 69(1)(a)$ ] Here, David's silence in the face of Professor Peterson's offer and his conduct in staying within earshot of the group is a sufficient objective manifestation of contractual intent for the court to find an implied-in-fact contract. Hence, a court will probably allow Peterson to recover the contract price. (B) is wrong because it states the wrong rationale. The Statute of Frauds would not be applicable even if the cost of the tour were over $\$ 500$; the $\$ 500$ provision of the Statute of Frauds is applicable only to the sale of goods. (C) is incorrect because it states a quasi-contract remedy. Quasi-contract is not really a contract at all; it is a legal remedy to prevent unjust enrichment where an enforceable contract is not present, and allows the claimant to recover the reasonable value of the benefits that he rendered to the other party. While Peterson probably could pursue a quasi-contract remedy because he rendered services with a reasonable expectation of being compensated, he is not limited to that remedy because he can establish an implied-in-fact contract. Hence, he can recover the contract price for the tour without having to establish that it was a reasonable fee for the lectures. (D) is wrong because, as stated above, David's conduct would be sufficient for a court to find the existence of an implied-in-fact contract here, or, at a minimum to grant a quasicontract remedy.

\section{Answer to Question 114}

(B) The court could find the title marketable by finding that an implied easement for the benefit of Blackacre was created from the existing use when Blackacre was severed from Whiteacre by the sale. The requirement that the seller provide the buyer with marketable title means that the title must be free from questions that present an unreasonable risk of litigation. A significant encroachment constitutes a title defect, regardless of whether an adjacent landowner is encroaching on the seller's land or vice versa. However, under the circumstances in choice (B), a court will be able to avoid the encroachment problem by implying an easement from the existing use (a quasi-easement). If a use exists on the "servient" part of the tract that is reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the "dominant" part, and a court determines that the parties intended the use to continue after division of the property, an easement will be implied. Given that title will not be marketable otherwise, the court will deem that the parties intended for the use to continue. (A) is wrong because the fact that the law requires a ramp would not prevent the adjacent property owner from bringing a lawsuit to have the encroachment removed. (C) is incorrect because an encroachment of 10 inches is significant enough to make title unmarketable. Whether an encroachment is significant enough to make title unmarketable is ultimately a question of fact; however, structures that encroach an inch or more over the property line are generally found by the courts to be significant encroachments. (D) is incorrect because the type of deed required by the contract does not establish marketability. Also, the fact that a contract calls for a quitclaim deed, which does not contain any covenants for title, does not eliminate the implied warranty to provide marketable title.

\section{Answer to Question 115}

(C) Ned will not recover because Parker did not breach a duty owed to him when he parked the car. This question can be analyzed in terms of either the extent of the duty of care or proximate cause. Where defendant's conduct creates an unreasonable risk of injury to persons in the position of the plaintiff, the general duty of care extends from the defendant to the plaintiff. However, no duty is imposed on a person to take precautions against events that cannot reasonably be foreseen. And in terms of proximate cause, intervening forces that produce unforeseeable results (results not within the increased risk created by defendant's negligence) will be deemed to be unforeseeable and superseding, and thus break the causal connection between the defendant's negligent act and the ultimate injury. Here, Parker's allegedly negligent parking did not increase the risk that Driver would sideswipe his car; Driver's conduct was an unforeseeable intervening force that cuts off Parker's liability for his conduct. (A) is incorrect for two reasons. For breach of a statute to establish negligence per se, plaintiff must show that the statute was designed to prevent the type of harm that occurred, which does not seem to be the case with the fire hydrant ordinance here. Furthermore, proving breach of an applicable statute establishes only duty and breach of duty. Actual and proximate cause must still be established for recovery, and proximate cause is lacking here. (B) is incorrect because the fact that Parker's conduct was a cause in fact of Ned's injury, even assuming that leaving the car there was negligent, does not establish the necessary element of proximate cause. (D) is incorrect because violation of an ordinance may establish negligence per se if the statutory standard is applicable to the situation.

\section{Answer to Question 116}

(B) Byer probably will be required to pay $\$ 6,000$ for all but lot 101 . Since the facts stipulate that there was an enforceable contract at $\$ 5,000$ as to lot 101 , there was no consideration for Byer's agreeing to pay more for that lot. However, as to the other lots, Ohner's telephone call would act as a revocation of the original offer, and a new offer at $\$ 6,000$; Byer's telegram was an acceptance of this new offer and bound Byer to pay the raised price.

\section{Answer to Question 117}

(D) Byer probably will not succeed. Notice to an offeree that the offeror has made an inconsistent contract with a third party operates as a revocation of the offer. (A) is incorrect because there was apparently no consideration given by Byer for Ohner's promise to keep the offer open until June 1 , and hence it too was revocable. (C) is not as good an answer as (D) because it is the notice to the offeree that constitutes the revocation (rather than the inconsistent contract with the third party). 

\section{Answer to Question 118}

(C) Arguably, Byer's telegram on May 2 could reasonably be interpreted as a rejection of Ohner's offer as to all other lots except 101; i.e., having accepted only 101 , he was impliedly rejecting the rest. Once rejected, the offer is terminated and the offeree's power of acceptance is extinguished; thus, the May 6 attempt to accept would be ineffective. None of the other alternatives makes sense. For impossibility of performance in (A) to apply, the impossibility must be "objective"; i.e., the duties could not be performed by anyone. Also, the impossibility must arise after the contract has been entered into. (D) is wrong because a condition precedent must be distinguished from a promise. A condition is the occurrence of an event that will create, limit, or extinguish the absolute duty to perform. In this case, it would probably be determined that the intention of the parties was an exchange of promises. (B) is incorrect because a unilateral mistake in most cases will not prevent formation of a contract. Only mutual mistake going to the heart of the bargain may prevent the formation of the contract.

\section{Answer to Question 119}

(B) Leonard's conviction will be sustained because states can prohibit or regulate conduct in general, and this is true even if the prohibition or regulation happens to interfere with a person's religious practices. The Free Exercise Clause cannot be used to challenge a neutral law of general applicability (such as the law against cruelty to animals) unless it can be shown that the law was motivated by a desire to interfere with religion. [See Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah (1993)] A law that regulates the conduct of all persons, as this statute appears to do, can be applied to prohibit the conduct of a single person even if the person's religious beliefs prohibit him from complying with the law. (A) is incorrect because the constitutional protection of religious beliefs does not require that the belief arise from a traditional, or even an organized, religion. Beliefs in Satan could have constitutional protection. (C) is wrong for the reasons given in the analysis of option (B). (D) is incorrect because the reasonableness of religious beliefs is not a suitable subject for constitutional inquiry. The courts may not, for example, declare a religion to be "false." The courts may inquire into the sincerity of religious belief, but the reasonableness of the belief is not relevant.

\section{Answer to Question 120}

(A) The phone message is admissible because it is an admission by a party-opponent. An admission is a statement made or an act done that amounts to a prior acknowledgment by one of the parties to an action of one of the relevant facts in dispute. The statement may be in writing and need not be against that party's interest at the time it was made. Here, Peters is offering a statement made by Dietrich that is directly relevant to the issue in the lawsuit. The phone message should therefore be ruled admissible. (B) is incorrect. While statements of a declarant's then-existing intent are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule to allow an inference that the intent was probably carried out, statements of memory or belief are not admissible to prove the truth of the fact remembered or believed. Thus, even if Dietrich left the message shortly after he made the agreement with Peters, it would not be admissible under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. (C) is incorrect because the privilege for confidential communications between a husband and wife does not extend to routine communications of a business nature that were not made in confidence. Here, Dietrich gave the message to the switchboard operator to relay to his wife. Thus, the communication was not made in reliance on the intimacy of the marital relationship. (D) is incorrect because the statement is admissible as an admission of a party-opponent, which is not hearsay under the Federal Rules. 

\section{Answer to Question 121}

(A) Patrick will prevail if Hotel's management breached its duty of care by not improving the locks. Innkeepers have a duty to use a high degree of care to aid or assist their guests and to prevent injury to them from third persons. Included in this duty is the duty to take reasonable precautions against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties. If, as stated in (A), Hotel's management had reason to believe the locks were inadequate, it breached its duty of care to Patrick, and this breach caused his injury. (C) is incorrect because the burglary would be a superseding intervening force only if it was unforeseeable. Also, if Hotel's management had reason to believe the locks were inadequate, it is likely that the burglary and assault will be deemed to be a foreseeable risk of the inadequate locks. (B) is incorrect because the fact that innkeepers owe a high degree of care to their guests does not make them strictly liable for their injuries; some breach of that duty of care must be shown. (D) is incorrect because compliance with the statute is not determinative. The statute sets forth a minimum standard of conduct regarding installation of locks in hotel rooms. Despite compliance with this statute, a careful hotel proprietor would be required to take additional precautions if he was or should have been aware of special circumstances; e.g., a history of prior criminal acts despite use of the statutorily mandated locks.

\section{Answer to Question 122}

(A) Patrick is liable for the type of invasion of privacy of intrusion upon plaintiff's private affairs or seclusion. Husband could reasonably expect that what he did in the woman's hotel room would be free from intrusion. Patrick violated Husband's seclusion by listening to the activities in the room. This intrusion would certainly be objectionable to a reasonable person. (D) is wrong because the viability of this cause of action does not depend upon publication by the defendant; the interest protected by this type of invasion of privacy is the plaintiff's right to be let alone, rather than his interest in not having the information disseminated. (B) is wrong because illegality of the defendant's actions is not an element of the prima facie case for this form of invasion of privacy. Even if the eavesdropping is legal, Patrick's conduct would still be an objectionable intrusion upon Husband's private domain. Finally, the fact that Husband may have been engaging in illegal adulterous conduct does not justify a private individual's intrusion on his solitude. (The situation might be different if Patrick were a law enforcement officer acting pursuant to previously obtained judicial authorization.) Thus, (C) is incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 123}

(D) The gifts are valid under the Rule. Hubert's will created a life estate in Waverly, contingent remainders in the class consisting of Hubert's children (contingent upon their attaining age 30), and contingent remainders in the class consisting of any children of Hubert's children (contingent on their surviving their parent, and the parent dying before attaining age 30). There are two keys to understanding the question. The first is that a will speaks at death, no matter when it was executed. Here, Hubert's will became an effective conveyance only when he died in 1990 . The second key is that the grandchildren (i.e., the children of Allan, Beth, or Carter) do not themselves have to survive to any particular age to take their gifts. The wording of the question is somewhat confusing on this point, but it is clear when read carefully. Since there are two future interests in the question, each must be analyzed separately under the Rule Against Perpetuities. The gift to Hubert's children is a class gift, and the Rule makes class gifts entirely void unless it is certain that the gift will vest or fail as to all members of the class within the perpetuities period. However, it is clear that this will be true here. The three children (Allan, Beth, and Carter) are all alive when the will speaks in 1990. Hence, they are all lives in being. (If Hubert's wife had been pregnant when Hubert died, that child, when born, would also have been considered a "life in being" as of Hubert's death.) The gift is certain to vest as to each of Hubert's children when each reaches age 30 , which is obviously within each's lifetime. Likewise, if one of the children dies before age 30 , his interest will fail; again, that is certain to happen within his or her lifetime. Since this is so, the class gift to the children of Hubert is certain to vest or fail as to each member within "lives in being." The gift is therefore valid under the Rule. It is not even necessary to add the 21-year period as permitted by the Rule. As to the class gift to the grandchildren of Hubert, a similar analysis follows. If any grandchild's interest ever becomes vested, it will do so immediately upon the death of that grandchild's parent (Allan, Beth, or Carter) prior to reaching age 30. Since those three persons are "lives in being" at Hubert's death, the grandchildren's interests are certain to vest or fail in every case at the end of a life in being. Again, it is not necessary to add the 21-year period as permitted by the Rule. (A) is wrong because the time of execution of the will is irrelevant; it is the date of the testator's death that commences the running of the perpetuities period. (B) is wrong for the same reason. (C) is wrong for the reasons discussed above.

\section{Answer to Question 124}

(D) To have a Fourth Amendment right, a defendant must have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the object seized. A person does not have such an expectation in objects held out to the public, such as account records held by a bank. Thus, (D) is correct. (A) is incorrect because a search warrant is not required where the defendant does not have a Fourth Amendment right. (B) is incorrect because Downs did not have a Fourth Amendment right in the records. Also, the period covered by the records was not necessarily overextensive. It could be that Downs was suspected of being involved in bribery for the preceding two years. (C) is incorrect because, even if the facts here presented describe an exigent situation, such a situation is actually an exception to the warrant requirement; and, like the warrant requirement, will not arise unless and until the defendant has a Fourth Amendment right.

\section{Answer to Question 125}

(A) Devon's knowledge that Plummer was about to sit on the chair makes his action a battery. A prima facie case for battery requires an act by defendant that brings about harmful or offensive contact to plaintiff, intent on the part of defendant to do the act, and causation. Here, Devon's act in pulling out Plummer's chair brought about offensive contact to Plummer. The causation element is satisfied not only by direct contact but also by indirect contact. Here, since Devon set in motion the events that brought about the offensive contact, causation exists. The intent element is satisfied if defendant knew with substantial certainty the consequences of his act. Here, if Devon knew that Plummer was about to sit on the chair, he also knew with substantial certainty that Plummer would fall if the chair were moved. Thus, Plummer will prevail on a battery cause of action. (B) is incorrect because Devon's negligence would not suffice for battery, and the only alternative cause of action based on negligence is negligent infliction of emotional distress, which requires that defendant's negligent conduct cause some physical injury to plaintiff. Here, Plummer suffered no physical harm. (C) is incorrect because the prima facie case for battery does not require physical harm to be shown. Even if Plummer cannot prove any actual damages, he will be entitled to a judgment for nominal damages. (D) is incorrect because it merely states Devon's motive for moving the chair. Regardless of the fact that Devon did not have an evil motive or intend to cause injury, he knew with substantial certainty that his conduct would cause an offensive contact to Plummer; this satisfies the intent requirement for battery.

\section{Answer to Question 126}

(B) Where a witness makes a statement not directly relevant to the issues in the case, the rule against impeachment on a collateral matter applies to bar the other side from proving the statement untrue by extrinsic evidence or by a prior inconsistent statement. Here, the actual number of years during which Walters was employed by the roofing company is irrelevant to the genuineness of Daly's signature on the note. Thus, this is a collateral matter, and Daly will not be permitted to impeach Walters on it. (D) then is incorrect. (C) is incorrect, not only because Wilson's testimony is irrelevant to any issue in the case, but also because such testimony is not evidence of a regularly conducted activity. (A) is incorrect. Although the witness is testifying orally about matters contained in a writing (the employment records), the records here are collateral to the issue being litigated. Accordingly, the collateral document exception applies and the best evidence rule is inapplicable.

\section{Answer to Question 127}

(D) The Secretary must distribute $\$ 100$ million, because the President's executive order constitutes an attempted exercise of legislative power. Although the Supreme Court has not fully resolved the scope of the President's power over internal affairs, it has held that the President has no power to refuse to spend appropriated funds when Congress has expressly mandated that they be spent. Congress has the power to spend money for the general welfare under Article I, and the President's action here infringes on that power. It follows that (A) and (B) are incorrect. (C) is incorrect because, although it presupposes a less drastic spending cut than (A) or (B), the President may not unilaterally impose even a cut of $10 \%$ when Congress has clearly required the spending of the full amount.

\section{Answer to Question 128}

(B) The outcome will turn on the definition of "value," because Crider, having received his deed after Price, is the junior claimant. His recordation prior to Price will protect Crider's right to Blackacre only if Crider took the deed in good faith and for value. Here, Owen apparently gave the deed to Crider in exchange for a release from the antecedent debt. If the jurisdiction in question considers this "value," Crider will benefit from the recording act because he is a subsequent bona fide purchaser for value, the very person the recording acts seek to protect. (A) is wrong because the form of deed has no effect on bona fide purchaser status. A quitclaim deed merely means the seller is not making any warranties of title. (C) is wrong because whether Price paid value is irrelevant. Price is not the subsequent purchaser. The recording act protects subsequent purchasers, so Price's interest depends on whether Crider benefits from the protection of the act. (D) is wrong because Price's title is good as against anyone except a subsequent bona fide purchaser for value. Thus, unless Crider is shown to qualify for the protection of the recording act, Price's title is good. There is no estoppel component to the recording acts.

\section{Answer to Question 129}

(B) The scenario in (B) provides the best defense because it would enable Green to rescind based on unilateral mistake. Rescission of a contract is available when one party is mistaken about material facts relating to a contract, the mistake adversely affects that party, and the other party knows of the mistake. (A) is wrong because in this case it is the nonmistaken party who is adversely affected. (Note that under choices (A) and (B) it is unclear whether Brown's claim is based on a contract. If it is, the promissory note will be treated as a modification. The modification could be rescinded as discussed above, but there also is an issue of whether there was valid consideration for the modification under the preexisting duty rule. (B) is still the best answer. Under the preexisting legal duty rule, past consideration is valid consideration if there is an honest dispute as to duty owed. There would be no honest dispute under (B) because the nonmistaken party is taking advantage of the mistaken party, but this is not true in (A).) (C) is wrong. The Statute of Frauds is not a problem here because Brown is seeking to enforce the promissory note-which complies with the Statute of Frauds-and not the original agreement. Neither does the preexisting legal duty rule negate the consideration here since there is an exception to the rule for reaffirmations of voidable promises (e.g., promises unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds, promises by infants, promises based on fraud, etc.). (D) is wrong because the statute of limitations would run anew on the note that Brown is trying to enforce, and there is no preexisting legal duty consideration problem because of the exception to the rule for "technical defense bars"- a new promise to pay a legal obligation barred by a technical defense (such as the statute of limitations) is enforceable according to the terms of the new promise.

\section{Answer to Question 130}

(A) Generally, a joint tortfeasor may recover indemnification from another joint tortfeasor where there is a considerable difference in the degree of fault. Here, Ellis, the person whose improper design actually caused Carla's injuries, is a "more wrongful" tortfeasor than Toyco. Thus, Toyco should prevail in its claim against Ellis, which result is reflected in (A). (B) is incorrect because indemnity is not available simply because Toyco and Ellis are joint tortfeasors. (C) is incorrect because Toyco's liability to Carla does not preclude it from obtaining indemnity from Ellis. (D) is incorrect because, even if Toyco was negligent in failing to discover the defect, it may still be entitled to indemnity from the person who negligently designed the game.

\section{Answer to Question 131}

(C) The Due Process Clause has been interpreted to require the prosecution to prove each element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The "malice aforethought" element of murder has traditionally been defined as encompassing the absence of provocation engendering a passion. Putting the burden of persuasion as to the existence of provocation and passion on the defendant relieves the prosecution of its burden as to their absence. Therefore, $(\mathrm{C})$ is the best answer and (A) is incorrect on the facts. (B) is incorrect because the presumption of "malice aforethought" is not a legitimate presumption. (D) is incorrect as a matter of law. Presumptions are permitted as long as they are not mandatory for the jury.

\section{Answer to Question 132}

(B) Tommy had a reasonable expectation of privacy, as evidenced by the obscuring of the window so that passersby could not see into the shop. Hence, the officer's search would have to be based on a valid warrant or qualify under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. Climbing on the trash cans and peering through a narrow opening eight feet above the pavement would be considered a violation of Tommy's Fourth Amendment rights and not a "plain view" of criminal activity. Since the seizure of the cocaine, mirror, and razor was based on the illegal search, the evidence could not be used by the state. (A) is wrong; absolute certainty of illegal activity is not required for a valid search. A reasonable belief is required. (C) is wrong. The arrest itself is probably invalid, and in any event a search of the next room would not be an area within the immediate control of the defendant. (D) is wrong. Consent to enter the shop is not a consent to search the back room.

\section{Answer to Question 133}

(B) The evidence is admissible as evidence of Wade's possible bias in favor of Dexter. Evidence that a witness is biased tends to show that the witness has a motive to lie. A witness may always be impeached by extrinsic evidence of bias, provided a proper foundation is laid. Bias may be shown by evidence of a business relationship or friendship with a party. Here, the fact that Wade is Dexter's partner in a gambling operation is admissible to impeach Wade for bias. (A) is wrong because the only relevant facet of Wade's character in this case is his veracity, and extrinsic evidence of bad acts is not admissible to impeach a witness. Under the Federal Rules, instances of a witness's conduct may be inquired into on cross-examination if they are probative of truthfulness (i.e., acts of deceit or lying), but extrinsic evidence is not allowed. It is doubtful that running a gambling operation would be found to be probative of Wade's truthfulness. Even if it were, extrinsic evidence would be inadmissible. (C) misstates the law. Criminal conduct can be shown by means other than admission or record of conviction. As discussed above, a party may be impeached by instances of bad or criminal conduct (even if it does not result in a conviction) if it is probative of truthfulness and it is brought out on cross-examination (no extrinsic evidence). (D) is wrong because extrinsic evidence of bias is admissible. (Note, however, that many states require that the bias be inquired into on cross-examination before extrinsic evidence is admissible.)

\section{Answer to Question 134}

(B) Cost of completion minus installments is the correct measure of damages because the facts give us the breach of a construction contract by the builder during construction. In such cases where the builder breaches after partially performing, the owner of the land is entitled to the cost of completion plus reasonable compensation for any delay in performance. Courts generally allow the builder to offset or recover for work performed to date to avoid the unjust enrichment of the owner. Hence, the unpaid installments should be deducted. Although this option does not mention reasonable compensation for delay, it is clearly a more accurate statement of the correct measure of damages than the other options. (A) is wrong because Farquart's damage relates to the cost of having the house completed. This cost could either exceed or be less than the restitution of the installments. If the amount is less, Farquart would be unjustly enriched. (C) is incorrect because damage relates to cost of completion and not market value. The house might have minimal market value in its partially completed state, and to measure damages based on the differences between such minimal value at the time of breach and market value when completed according to specifications could dramatically overstate Farquart's real damages. (D) is incorrect because damages for mental distress are too speculative and are not awarded in a contract situation.

\section{Answer to Question 135}

(C) Farquart's additional expense in providing temporary housing would be the best basis for a claim of consequential damages. In addition to the standard measure of damages, consequential damages may be awarded for further losses resulting from the breach that any reasonable person would have foreseen would occur from a breach at the time of entry into the contract. Temporary housing expenses would have been foreseeable at the time Sawtooth and Farquart entered into the contract. (A) is incorrect because it would be consequential damage to Junior rather than Farquart, because it is Junior who will incur the expense. (B) is incorrect because the fiancee's jilting of Junior is not a foreseeable consequence of the breach. (D) is incorrect because at the time Sawtooth and Farquart entered into the contract, both parties would have reasonably assumed that the house would be built and completed by experienced construction personnel. Farquart's attempt to complete the house himself and the ensuing negligence were not foreseeable.

\section{Answer to Question 136}

(B) The legal effect of the two circumstances is best stated by (B). When a condition or duty of performance (i.e., payment) is broken, the beneficiary of the condition or duty has an election: he may (i) terminate his liability; or (ii) continue under the contract. If he chooses the latter course, he will be deemed to have waived the condition or duty. Since Sawtooth did not terminate his liability to complete construction of the house, but rather treated the contract as ongoing, he is deemed to have waived the delay in payment. Farquart's failure to require a certificate from Builders would be deemed a revocable waiver. At any time Farquart could insist on the certificate before making a monthly payment. Because the certificate represents that the work performed during a particular month met the specifications, Farquart would always retain the right to condition his payment for a particular month on receipt of the certificate. (A) is incorrect because there was no estoppel waiver as to either I. or II. Whenever a party indicates that he is "waiving" a condition before it is to happen, or some performance before it is rendered, and the person addressed detrimentally relies upon such an indication, the courts will hold this to be a binding (estoppel) waiver. Sawtooth never indicated in advance that he was waiving the four monthly payments and there was no detrimental reliance by Farquart. Likewise, Farquart never indicated in advance that he was waiving the certificate requirement and there was no detrimental reliance by Sawtooth. (C) is incorrect because mutual rescission requires an $\boldsymbol{e x}$ press agreement between the parties to rescind. The agreement to rescind is itself a binding contract supported by consideration (the giving up by each party of his right to counterperformance from the other). The parties did not rescind the contract here. (D) is wrong because, as noted above, there was no estoppel waiver as to II. Also, there was never any discharge of Farquart's duty to make the four payments. (Although Farquart's duty might be excused because no work was done between November and February, this does not necessarily follow from the terms of the contract.)

\section{Answer to Question 137}

(D) The outcome of Stone's suit will be governed by whether the power to "sell and convey" is construed to include the power to execute the usual form of deed used to convey realty. If Mitchell lacked the authority to include covenants for title, Rogers will probably not be bound by those covenants. (A) is wrong because the deed included covenants. It may be slightly relevant on the issue of how the power of attorney should be construed, but the outcome of the case will not be governed by this determination. (B) is wrong for a couple of reasons. Covenants for title are not like real covenants; they are not characterized as personal or running with the land. Covenants for title are either present or future. Even if the terminology of personal or running with the land were used, (B) would be incorrect because the suit concerns the original parties; thus, whether the covenant runs with the land would be irrelevant. (C) is wrong because bona fide purchaser status is irrelevant to the enforcement of covenants for title. This status is important mostly for purposes of the recording statute.

\section{Answer to Question 138}

(A) The court should dismiss the action because Midwest cannot show that any injury it allegedly suffered will be remedied by a decision enjoining performance of the Great Plains contract. Even if a federal court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case, it will not decide a constitutional challenge to a government action unless the party challenging the action has "standing" to raise the constitutional issue, i.e., a concrete stake in the outcome of the controversy. This requires plaintiff to show an injury in fact-caused by the government-that will be remedied by a decision in its favor. Here, Midwest cannot establish that whatever injury it might have suffered by having its bid rejected will be remedied by an injunction preventing Great Plains from performing its contract with the government; hence, it does not have standing to bring this action. (B) is incorrect because it is too broad; even in the absence of express constitutional limitations, the government is restricted by the Bill of Rights in the exercise of its contracting power. (C) is wrong because Midwest does not have standing to raise a claim on behalf of minorities potentially affected by the waiver. Even if the court were to consider the merits of the case, the government, while it might have had to show a compelling government interest to institute its affirmative action policies, would not have to show a compelling interest to suspend the policies. (D) is wrong because Midwest does not have standing to assert a violation of its rights in an action to enjoin another party's performance of a contract with the government.

\section{Answer to Question 139}

(B) Under pure comparative negligence, the plaintiff may recover no matter how great her negligence. In this case, Phyllis has suffered damages of $\$ 100,000$. Because she was $40 \%$ negligent, she may recover only $\$ 60,000$ ( $\$ 100,000$ less $\$ 40,000$ ). Therefore, (B) is correct, and (A) is wrong. Absent a statute, damages are not reduced or mitigated because of benefits received from collateral sources (e.g., health insurance). Thus, Phyllis's receipt of $\$ 10,000$ under her insurance plan does not diminish her recovery. (C) is therefore wrong. Andrew and Brett are jointly and severally liable for Phyllis's injuries because their negligent acts combined to proximately cause an indivisible injury to Phyllis. Because Andrew and Brett are jointly and severely liable, Phyllis may recover the entire $\$ 60,000$ from Andrew. Thus, (D) is wrong.

\section{Answer to Question 140}

(A) Ben, who is apparently a purchaser at arm's length, had ample opportunity to inspect the property and discover the conduit. The law will not protect a party in Ben's situation who failed to protect himself. Owen, in the absence of a fiduciary relationship with Ben or of any affirmative representations that Owen knows or discovers to have been false, has no duty to disclose the existence of the conduit except (in some jurisdictions) if he knows that Ben is laboring under a misapprehension as to a basic assumption and the act of nondisclosure is made in bad faith. The facts do not support either of these exceptions. It does not appear that Owen acted in bad faith, particularly because Owen permitted an inspection and Ben had ample opportunity to discover the truth. Furthermore, it does not appear that Ben will be unable to build the high-rise simply because of the presence of the conduit. (B) is incorrect because Ben's purpose is not irrelevant: if Owen knew about Ben's purpose, Owen may have a duty to disclose any fact that would preclude that purpose. (C) is incorrect because the existence of the conduit does not make title unmarketable. (D) is incorrect because nothing in the facts indicates that Ben could not build the high-rise on the property despite the existence of the conduit; there are no facts indicating that Ben will experience grossly excessive costs in attempting to do so; and the existence of the conduit, which was discoverable, is not the sort of unforeseeable supervening event that would give rise to a frustration defense.

\section{Answer to Question 141}

(B) Burglary requires a breaking and entering with the intent to commit a felony therein. Because what Donaldson intended to do when he broke in was not a crime, it cannot be said that he entered with the intent to commit a felony. For this reason, he should be acquitted of burglary. It follows that (B) is correct and (C) is incorrect. (D) is incorrect. While the fact that Donaldson was unable to retrieve the exams would not have been a defense to the burglary charge, the decisive fact in this case involves legal impossibility, not factual impossibility. (A) is incorrect because the crime of burglary would have been complete at the moment of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony therein. However, because looking at exam questions was not a crime, Donaldson could not be convicted of either burglary or attempted burglary.

\section{Answer to Question 142}

(C) Martha will lose unless she was in the "zone of danger" with Sue. Under the traditional approach for negligent infliction of emotional distress, one of the elements for recovery by a bystander is that she must have been within the "zone of danger" or "target zone" of defendant's negligent conduct. Unless Martha was crossing the street with Sue and therefore in the "zone of danger," she will not recover. Thus, (A) is incorrect. (The modern "foreseeability" approach would permit Martha to recover even though she was outside the "zone of danger"- her relationship to the person injured and her presence at the scene would establish foreseeability under this approach.) (B) is wrong even though severe shock to the nervous system may be a sufficient physical injury; Martha will lose because of the "zone of danger" requirement. (D) is incorrect because Martha's relationship to Sue is not relevant under the traditional "zone of danger" approach.

\section{Answer to Question 143}

(B) The testimony of Watts should be admitted as a statement to a physician made for purposes of diagnosis or treatment. The Federal Rules allow the admission of statements not only of past symptoms and medical history, but also of the cause or source of the condition as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment. This is an exception to the hearsay rule. (A) is incorrect because this is not a statement of present bodily condition which falls under a different exception to the hearsay rule. (C) is incorrect because, as explained above, this testimony is admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule. (D) is incorrect because this hearsay exception does not require unavailability of the declarant.

\section{Answer to Question 144}

(A) If a law burdens a fundamental right, the state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to promote a compelling state interest. In all other cases, a law is valid if it rationally relates to a legitimate end of government. Where the "rational basis" test applies, the law is presumed valid and the burden is on the challenging party to prove its invalidity. The statute at issue infringes on Zeller's right of parental custody, which is almost certainly a fundamental right. Thus, the state bears the burden of showing that this statute is needed to promote a compelling state interest. (A) is correct. (B) and (D) are wrong because showing a rational relationship is not enough since a fundamental right is involved. (C) and (D) are wrong because the burden is on the state, not Zeller.

\section{Answer to Question 145}

(D) A conviction for felony murder requires that the defendant have had the intent to commit the underlying felony. Here, because Dunbar believed that the $\$ 200$ rightfully belonged to her, she did not have the intent to permanently deprive Stone of his money. Thus, Dunbar lacked the intent required for conviction of the underlying felony, and she cannot be found guilty of felony murder. (A) is wrong because it fails to account for the necessary intent to commit the underlying felony. (B) is wrong because taking Balcom to the store did not in and of itself create a risk of death. Also, (B), like (A), fails to account for the necessary intent to commit the underlying felony. $(\mathrm{C})$ is wrong because the required mental state for felony murder (i.e., intent to commit the underlying felony) has nothing to do with knowledge that Balcom was armed. 

\section{Answer to Question 146}

(C) Conviction as an accessory requires that the defendant have given aid, counsel, or encouragement with the intent that an offense be committed or, in some cases, knowing that she was contributing to the commission of a crime. If Dunbar neither planned to use force nor knew that Balcom was armed, and she believed that the $\$ 200$ was rightfully hers, then she cannot be said to have aided, counseled, or encouraged Balcom with the intent that an offense be committed, or knowing that she was contributing to the commission of a crime. (A) and (B) are incorrect because they ignore the encouragement and intent necessary for conviction as an accessory. (D) is incorrect because, even if Dunbar was only exercising self-help, this alternative does not address her state of mind regarding the charge of being an accessory to murder.

\section{Answer to Question 147}

(D) The accused in a criminal case may introduce evidence of a pertinent character trait because it may tend to show that he did not commit the crime charged. But here, evidence of Duncan's character for truth is not pertinent to a charge of a violent crime (aggravated assault). (A) is wrong because the character evidence is admissible only if it is pertinent to the charged crime. (B) is wrong because Duncan's credibility is not in issue, since he did not testify. (C) is wrong because in a criminal trial such evidence may be admitted, if pertinent, at the initiative of the accused.

\section{Answer to Question 148}

(B) If the decision is for Andy, it will be because the right to take minerals is an incident of a fee simple interest. The owner of a defeasible fee has the same right to possession and privileges of use as the owner of a fee simple absolute. Only unconscionable conduct by the owner that substantially reduces the value of the land could possibly be enjoined by the person who would take the land should the current owner's estate terminate. (A) is incorrect because Bob has an executory interest. (C) is an incorrect statement of the law. A person in possession (e.g., a life tenant), absent other circumstances, does not have the right to exploit mineral resources. (D) is incorrect because it is irrelevant. Andy's mental state or "good faith" or lack thereof has no bearing on his right to take minerals from his fee estate.

\section{Answer to Question 149}

(D) Norris will not prevail if Josephs had reasonable grounds for his statement. As a former employer responding to queries of a prospective employer about a job applicant, Dr. Josephs has a qualified privilege. Such a privilege is not absolute; it exists only if exercised in a reasonable manner and for a proper purpose. The privilege may be lost if the speaker made a statement not within the scope of the privilege or if the speaker acted with "malice" (i.e., knowledge that the statement was untrue or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity). If Josephs had reasonable grounds for his belief, he was not acting with malice. (A) is incorrect because of the reasons stated in the analysis of option (D). A statement of opinion may be actionable if it appears to be based on specific facts which, if expressly stated, would be defamatory. However, because of the qualified privilege, Dr. Josephs will not be liable for his mistake as long as his belief was reasonable. (B) is incorrect because the fact that the statement was in a category that is slander per se (i.e., adversely reflecting on Norris's abilities to practice her profession) goes to whether Norris must plead special damages. It does not, however, undermine the qualified privilege. (C) is incorrect because permission to make inquiry is not tantamount to consent to be defamed. 

\section{Answer to Question 150}

(D) Marketable title is one that is free from reasonable doubt in fact or in law. Here, there is confusion because the building restrictions apply to all the lots shown on the map, but the parcel at issue is not one of the 10 numbered lots. Thus, it is unclear whether the parcel is subject to restrictions that will reduce the uses of the lot or its market value. Thus, (D) is correct. (A) is wrong because it is not clear that the undesignated parcel is not subject to the subdivision restrictions. It was included on the map and the restrictions apply to "all lots shown." (B) is wrong because even though it is not one of the 10 lots, it may be bound by the restrictions. Since this is unclear, title is not marketable. (C) is wrong because there could be marketable title without government approval.

\section{Answer to Question 151}

(C) Venus is entitled to the contract price for the grapes delivered and accepted, but Tipple is entitled to cover-to purchase grapes at the market price prevailing at the time of performance and to deduct any increase over the Venus-Tipple contract price. (A) is wrong because Tipple is entitled to cover, and does not "waive" the breach by accepting a part performance. (B) is wrong because the price for the grapes delivered is the contract price, not the prevailing market price. (D) is wrong because Venus is entitled to payment for the grapes she delivered, and would be able to enforce her claim through litigation, if necessary.

\section{Answer to Question 152}

(C) Wall's testimony is admissible as prior identification by the witness. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a statement of prior identification by the witness of another person is nonhearsay. Thus, (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because Wall is testifying at the trial and is subject to cross-examination. Thus, Dray's right of confrontation is not violated. (D) is incorrect because past recollection recorded is an exception to the hearsay rule, and the statement here at issue is nonhearsay. Also, past recollection recorded involves use of a writing made when the events were fresh in the mind of the witness. There is no such writing involved here.

\section{Answer to Question 153}

(A) The modification is fully enforceable. Although there was no consideration for Barnes's promise to take only half of the bargained-for production, none is required because this is a contract for the sale of goods and hence subject to U.C.C. section 2-209(1), which provides that a good faith modification is enforceable regardless of lack of consideration. Hence, (C) is wrong. (B) and (D) are wrong because they imply that the original agreement was not fully enforceable. The agreement between Barnes and Stevens is basically an output contract and is fully enforceable under the U.C.C. Although generally the subject matter of a contract must be definite and certain, an agreement to buy or sell all of one's requirements or output is deemed capable of being made certain by reference to objective, extrinsic facts. It is assumed that the parties will act in good faith.

\section{Answer to Question 154}

(D) Discharge of contractual duties by impossibility must be objective; i.e., the duties could not be performed by anyone. Generally, physical incapacity of a person necessary to effectuate the contract only excuses performance where the services are deemed "unique." That would not be the case here. Stevens's allergy to the bees does not constitute objective impossibility of performance because his duties are delegable. Hence, his failure to deliver is not excused. (B) is wrong because his performance would be excused only if the parties had entered into a contract for personal services. (A) is wrong because Stevens promised to supply at least $100 \mathrm{lbs}$. per month. (C) is wrong because such notice would not excuse a breach.

\section{Answer to Question 155}

(C) The basis for finding that the bank's due process rights have been violated is that it should have received notice through personal service or by mail. When the government seeks to use a judicial or administrative process to take or terminate property interests, it must give notice to those persons whose property interests may be taken by that process. The form of notice must be reasonably designed to insure that those persons will in fact be notified of the proceedings. Here, the bank had recorded its mortgage and presumably could have been notified by mail that the property was being seized by the government. Being deprived of the opportunity to protect its interest in the property violated the bank's due process rights under the three-part test of Mathews $v$. Eldridge. Mathews lists three criteria that the courts should weigh in determining what constitutes fair process: (i) the importance of the individual interest involved, (ii) the value of specific procedural safeguards to that interest, and (iii) the governmental interest in fiscal and administrative efficiency. Here, the Bank has an important property right that is being terminated, the procedure of publishing a general notice was not sufficient to safeguard its interests, and the government interest in efficiency would not have been overburdened by requiring notice by mail to parties with a recorded interest in the property. (A) is wrong because it is too broad. Under Mathews, the government is not required to provide personal notice to all parties if it is not feasible, nor is it required to provide a preseizure hearing if exigent circumstances make it impracticable. (B) is incorrect because even when a private party is seeking to use a judicial or administrative process, state action is involved and the Due Process Clause must be satisfied; hence, notice to a record mortgage holder would be required even if a private party were seeking to seize the property through judicial means. (D) is incorrect because the state's characterization of the mortgagee's interest is not critical; the mortgagee has legal rights to the property that are protected by the Due Process Clause, regardless of how the rights are characterized.

\section{Answer to Question 156}

(C) The court should deny Darren's motion if it finds that he voluntarily consented to the search that revealed the drugs. The police may conduct a valid warrantless search of an area otherwise protected by the Fourth Amendment if they have a voluntary and intelligent consent to do so. The scope of the search is governed by the scope of the consent, but consent extends to all areas to which a reasonable person under the circumstances would believe it extends. The fact that a defendant has been placed under arrest does not mean that he cannot otherwise give valid consent to a search, and the search that led to the discovery of the cocaine in this case was within the scope of the consent that Darren provided. Thus, he has no Fourth Amendment grounds to exclude evidence of the cocaine. (A) is wrong because the fact that Darren was arrested did not mean that his consent was not voluntary. Whether consent is voluntary is judged by the totality of the circumstances. He does not necessarily need to be told that he has a right to withhold consent or be informed of the specific items being sought in the search. As long as his consent was not the product of express or implied coercion, it will be valid. (B) is incorrect even though it is a true statement. After making a lawful arrest of the occupant of an automobile, the police may conduct a warrantless search of the passenger compartment of the automobile but may not search the trunk. Here, however, the search of the trunk was based on Darren's consent rather than as incident to his arrest. (D) is incorrect. The lesser expectation of privacy in vehicles permits the police to search a vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband or evidence of a crime. However, the facts in this question do not indicate that Officer Jones had probable cause to search the trunk of Darren's car. The more certain basis for upholding the validity of the search is the consent given by Darren.

\section{Answer to Question 157}

(B) Defendant is guilty of larceny because he had the intent to deprive the victim permanently of his car at the time of the taking. Neither victim's fraudulently procured consent nor defendant's later return of the car negates the larceny. (A) is wrong because, since the defendant intended to return the car within a reasonable time and, at the time of the taking, had a substantial ability to do so, his unauthorized borrowing of the car does not constitute larceny. (C) is wrong because the elements of false pretenses have not been met. False pretenses involves the obtaining of title to the property of another by an intentional false statement with intent to defraud the owner. Here, since defendant did not get title, it cannot be false pretenses. (D) is wrong because no conversion occurred. For embezzlement to have occurred, the defendant who was in legal possession of the car would have actually had to convert it for his own gain. Returning the car within a reasonable time would not constitute embezzlement.

\section{Answer to Question 158}

(A) The testimony should be admissible as sufficiently authenticated. Where the identity of the speaker of an oral statement is important, authentication as to the speaker's identity is required. A statement made during a telephone conversation may be authenticated by a party to the call who testifies that: (i) he recognized the other party's voice; (ii) the speaker had knowledge of certain facts that only a particular person would have; or (iii) he called a certain person's telephone number, and a voice answered, "This is (the person whose number was called)." Here, the identity of the person with whom Jones spoke on the telephone is important because the speaker admitted that his horse caused the damage. Thus, authentication is required. Because Jones called the listed phone number for Smith, and the answering voice identified itself as Smith, authentication is proper under (iii) above. (B) is incorrect because the accuracy of phone books is not an accurately verifiable fact or a matter of common knowledge. (C) is incorrect because, as noted above, familiarity with the speaker's voice is only one means of authentication. (D) is incorrect because there is no requirement of corroboration by the speaker.

\section{Answer to Question 159}

(A) Photographs are admissible only if identified by a witness as a portrayal of certain facts relevant to the issue and verified by the witness as a correct representation of those facts. The witness who identifies the photograph need only be familiar with the scene or object that is depicted. It is not necessary to call the photographer to authenticate the photograph. Jones, as the owner of the cornfield, is familiar with the field that is depicted. Thus, Jones may testify to the photograph as an accurate portrayal of the condition of the field after the damage was done. (B) is incorrect because, if the photograph accurately depicts the damage, the photograph need not have been taken within a week after the occurrence. The fact that it was taken within a week does not establish that it was an accurate portrayal of the damage to the field. (C) is incorrect because, as noted above, it is not necessary to call the photographer. (D) is incorrect because, as long as the photograph is properly authenticated, it is admissible.

\section{Answer to Question 160}

(C) State laws based on alienage are subject to strict scrutiny, meaning that a compelling state interest must be shown to justify the disparate treatment. However, if the law discriminates against alien participation in the self-governance process, the "rationality" test is applied. Here, Clovis's application for tuition assistance does not relate to participation in the governmental process, thus the strict scrutiny test applies. (B) is incorrect, because it is based on the assumption that the "rationality" test is appropriate. (C) is the only answer that addresses the fact that the state must demonstrate a compelling interest to justify the restriction. It follows that (A) is incorrect. (D) is incorrect because aliens are excluded from the protection of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

\section{Answer to Question 161}

(C) Partition and cross-easements is the best approach because the holder of an easement has the right to use a tract of land (called the servient tenement) for a special purpose, but has no right to possess and enjoy the tract of land. Typically, easements are created to give their holder the right of access over a tract of land. An easement is deemed appurtenant when the right of special use benefits the holder in his physical use or enjoyment of another tract of land. For an easement appurtenant to exist, there must be two tracts of land. The dominant tenement has the benefit of the easement, and the servient tenement is subject to the easement right. One consequence of appurtenance is that the benefit passes with transfers of the benefited land, regardless of whether the easement is mentioned in the conveyance. Partition is necessary to create the required two tracts of land. (A) is incorrect because a covenant not to partition is personal to the parties and thus subsequent owners will not be bound by the covenant. It is also wrong because under the principles of the Rule Against Restraints on Alienation, the courts will enforce prohibitions against partition by any one co-tenant only if the restriction is to last for a reasonable time. (B) is wrong because, as noted above, easements appurtenant require two tracts of land. As long as the strip remains undivided, a new neighbor, as a tenant-in-common, would have the right to partition the strip and thus terminate the cross-easement. (D) is incorrect because a trust in perpetuity would violate the Rule Against Restraints on Alienation. The effect of the trust would be to create a disabling restraint.

\section{Answer to Question 162}

(B) Petrone will prevail if the cement dust constituted an unreasonable interference. For a private nuisance to be actionable, defendant's conduct must amount to a substantial, unreasonable interference with plaintiff's use and enjoyment of property. The operative language in the choice is "interfered unreasonably," and in most MBE nuisance questions such language usually can be found in the correct choice. (A) is incorrect because, even though a balancing test is sometimes used in nuisance cases, mere increased costs is not a sufficient justification to allow continued unreasonable interference with plaintiff's rights. (C) is incorrect because the number of individuals affected is not determinative of whether a nuisance exists. (D) is similarly incorrect; conformity to general methods in the industry will not preclude Silo from being liable for nuisance.

\section{Answer to Question 163}

(D) Federal courts are barred from rendering advisory opinions. The legislation here calls for a federal court to transmit to the head of a federal agency an opinion regarding the proper disbursement of federal funds, and the agency head is not required to follow the opinion. This would be an advisory opinion. (A) is incorrect because it fails to consider the necessity for a case and controversy prior to the exercise of federal judicial power. (B) may be a true statement, but the rendition of advisory opinions by a federal court is not a permissible method to settle disputes involving the spending of federal monies. (C) is incorrect because the Eleventh Amendment pertains to suits brought against a state by citizens of that or any other state. Such a suit is not at issue here. 

\section{Answer to Question 164}

(A) The credibility of an expert witness may be attacked by cross-examining him as to: (i) his general knowledge of the field in which he is claiming to be an expert; and (ii) his particular knowledge of the facts upon which his opinion is based. Pine's question on cross-examination relates to Wall's general knowledge of the field of chemistry. This bears directly on the weight to be given Wall's testimony. Thus, (A) is correct. (C) is incorrect because any determination of Wall's qualifications as an expert does not preclude an attack on his credibility or on the weight to be given the opinion. (B) and (D) are incorrect because the question relates to neither Wall's truthfulness nor his character.

\section{Answer to Question 165}

(A) Because stopping a car is a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes, police generally may not stop a car unless they have at least a reasonable suspicion that a law has been violated. However, even absent that suspicion, police may set up roadblocks to stop cars if (i) the cars are stopped on the basis of some neutral, articulable standard, and (ii) the stops are designed to serve a purpose closely related to a particular problem arising from automobiles and their mobility. [See Indianapolis v. Edmund (2000)] The use of a checkpoint to detect evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing unrelated to use of cars or highway safety, such as the conduct here, was improper and thus the marijuana would be inadmissible under the exclusionary rule. (B) is wrong because if the car had been properly stopped, the use of the flashlight would not have been improper. (C) is wrong because the established police plan cannot overcome the constitutional objection to the random stopping. (D) is wrong because the stopping of the car was improper. If it had been proper, the subsequent search would have been proper since it would have been based on probable cause.

\section{Answer to Question 166}

(C) Hunko is likely to prevail because of the preexisting duty rule. At common law, a modification of a contract required consideration because the parties were under a preexisting legal duty to perform. Since there was no consideration for the modification, Adman is not entitled to the $\$ 2,000$. (B) would be correct if the U.C.C. applied, but it does not apply to this fact situation. (A) is wrong; the parol evidence rule does not apply to subsequent modifications. (D) is wrong. It is a true statement but it is not the reason Hunko will prevail.

\section{Answer to Question 167}

(D) Judgment could be for either Purvis or Rand, because there is a split of authority as to whether a recorded deed, obtained from a grantor who had no title at that time, but who afterwards obtains title, is constructive notice to a subsequent purchaser from the same grantor. Thus, the answer to this question turns on whether the deed from Vine to Purvis constitutes constructive notice to Rand. (A) is incorrect because it does not address the issue of Rand's notice of the prior deed. (B) is incorrect because of the possibility that the deed to Purvis should have put Rand on notice of Purvis's claim. (C) is incorrect because it does not address the issue of notice.

\section{Answer to Question 168}

(B) The rehabilitation will most likely be permitted to rebut testimony of Willie's perjury conviction. Under Federal Rule 608(a), a witness can be rehabilitated with evidence of his good reputation for truthfulness after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by "opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise." The commentary to 608 specifically states that impeachment through a prior conviction is covered by the "or otherwise" provision and therefore will give rise to rehabilitation through reputation for truthfulness evidence. (A) and (D) are wrong because the commentary to 608 specifically states that impeachment through bias does not allow rehabilitation with reputation for truthfulness evidence. (C) is possible. It could be argued that the impeachment in (C) qualifies under the "or otherwise" provision. (C) is not, however, as good an answer as (B), where the rehabilitation through good reputation evidence would clearly be allowed.

\section{Answer to Question 169}

(D) This question involves spoken defamation (slander). Ordinary slander is not actionable in the absence of pleading and proof of special damages. The defamation here does not fall within one of the slander per se categories (adverse reflection on plaintiff's abilities in his profession, loathsome disease, crime involving moral turpitude, unchastity of a woman). Thus, Poe will not prevail without a showing of special damages. (A) is incorrect because it implies that Poe can prevail without proof of special damages. (C) is incorrect because proof that the defendant knew of the falsity of the defamatory statement is not required in cases involving a private person plaintiff and a matter of private concern. (B) is incorrect because "extreme and outrageous conduct" is part of the prima facie case for intentional infliction of emotional distress, not for defamation.

\section{Answer to Question 170}

(A) Extreme and outrageous conduct is an element of the prima facie case for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Because Kane's conduct was extreme and outrageous, intentional, and likely caused Poe severe distress, Poe will probably prevail. (B) is incorrect because mere intrusion on the plaintiff's property does not constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress. (C) is incorrect because physical injury is not required to recover for this tort. (D) is incorrect because, even if Poe still owed Store for the merchandise, this would not justify extreme and outrageous methods of bill collection. Thus (A) is the best answer.

\section{Answer to Question 171}

(B) The requisite intent for intentional torts (such as battery) is satisfied if the actor knows with substantial certainty that the consequences of his conduct will result. Here, by slamming the door shut, Poe set in motion a force that brought about harmful contact to Kane. (A) is wrong because a request to leave the property would not have justified commission of the battery. Generally, one may use reasonable force to prevent the commission of a tort against his property, if use of force is preceded by a request to desist. Kane was not engaged in the commission of a tort against Poe's property. Thus, Poe's use of force was not justified, with or without a request to leave the property. (C) is wrong because, although Kane's conduct undoubtedly did trigger Poe's response, there are no circumstances indicating justification for such a response. (D) is wrong because, as explained above, Kane was not committing a tort against Poe's property so as to justify the use of force.

\section{Answer to Question 172}

(A) Rimm can be convicted of murder because the way Rimm employed the firearm was sufficient to fulfill the "malice" requirement for murder. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought may be express or implied. In addition to obvious malice situations where there is intention to kill, malice is implied where there is: (i) intent to inflict great bodily injury; (ii) reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life (also called acting with "an abandoned and malignant heart"); or (iii) felony murder situations. Here, Rimm's firing of the gun when aimed slightly to the side of Hill in an enclosed room (where ricochet was likely) constituted acting with reckless disregard of an unjustifiably high risk to human life. Rimm's malice is thus implied. (B) is incorrect because the provocation that would reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter is not present in the facts. (C) is incorrect because Rimm's activities could be found to be more dangerous than "criminal negligence." (D) is incorrect. Although Hill's conduct of aiming a pistol at Rimm and firing could constitute assault with a deadly weapon, the more serious crime of which Rimm can be convicted is murder, because Hill was killed by Rimm's reckless conduct.

\section{Answer to Question 173}

(C) The statute will probably be found to violate the First Amendment because it is overbroad. The state can adopt a specific definition of obscenity applying to materials sold to minors, even though the material might not be obscene in terms of an adult audience. However, government may not prohibit the sale or distribution of material to adults merely because it is inappropriate for children. Here, there is no indication that the state has attempted less restrictive means of keeping minors from the objectionable video games, such as requiring arcade operators to put these games in a limited access area and monitor their use. While an outright ban on these games may be the most certain means of denying minors access to them, the denial of adult access to them indicates that the statute will probably be found unconstitutional. (A) is incorrect even though it is a true statement. As indicated above, a statute designed to protect minors must be narrowly drawn to avoid a First Amendment violation. (B) is incorrect because the fact that the statute precisely defines the content that is prohibited indicates only that it probably is not unconstitutionally vague; it does not affect its overbreadth problem. (D) is wrong because, as indicated above, restrictions on materials available to minors do not necessarily have to satisfy the constitutional test for obscenity. In addition, choice (D) misstates the test: the element of serious social value is determined by a national standard, rather than community standards.

\section{Answer to Question 174}

(C) Wren's testimony is inadmissible hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement by the declarant (Dent) offered to prove that Dent's wife had driven through a red light, and no hearsay exceptions apply here. (A) is wrong because Dent is not a party to the litigation, and the husband-wife relationship does not suffice to allow the use of the statement against his wife as a vicarious admission. (B) is wrong because there is no indication that Dent is unavailable as a witness, which is required for the statement against interest exception to apply. (D) is incorrect because Dent's statement was a statement of fact, rather than opinion; further, even if it were opinion, that would not make it inadmissible if it otherwise qualified as an admission.

\section{Answer to Question 175}

(C) Judgment should be for Jose. Luis, by quitclaim deed, conveyed to Jose his future interest in Blackacre; technically, it is an executory interest. When Eugenia died survived by a husband and no children, Luis would have taken title to Blackacre pursuant to Ortega's will. However, because of the quitclaim deed, Jose takes title to the property. (A) is incorrect because no after-acquired title is involved; Luis had his future interest from the moment of Ortega's death, and that is what his deed transferred. (B) is incorrect because, although it is true that Jose took nothing under Ortega's will, Luis chose to convey his interest in Blackacre to Jose, as permitted by the applicable statute. (D) is incorrect because after-acquired title is inapplicable to these facts. Moreover, the after-acquired title doctrine applies to conveyances by warranty deed. The conveyance here was effected by quitclaim deed.

\section{Answer to Question 176}

(A) In single delivery contracts, the buyer can reject goods for any defect in the goods, even if the breach is not material. Here, the ties sent by Kravat were nonconforming goods. Thus, Clothier properly rejected the ties delivered on June 3. (B) is incorrect because even if Kravat had notified Clothier that the ties were shipped as an accommodation, this would merely be a counteroffer, and Clothier would not have been obligated to accept the ties. (C) is incorrect because acceptance of an offer by shipment of nonconforming goods results in a breach of the contract, giving the buyer the right to reject. (D) is incorrect because, after rejection of goods in his possession, the buyer's obligation is to hold the goods with reasonable care at the seller's disposition for a time sufficient to permit the seller to remove them. The buyer is not obligated to promptly return the goods to the seller in order to preserve his remedies.

\section{Answer to Question 177}

(C) Where a buyer has rejected goods because of defects, the seller may, within the time originally provided for performance, cure by giving reasonable notice of intention to do so and making a new tender of conforming goods, which the buyer must then accept. Kravat took all of the steps necessary to cure. Consequently, Clothier's rejection of the ties tendered on June 30 was improper. It follows that (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because Kravat's prompt dispatch of a telegram on June 4, indicating his intention to cure the defect, does not indicate a clear unwillingness or inability to perform, as is required for anticipatory repudiation. (D) is incorrect because modification of the contract is not at issue here. By curing the defective delivery, Kravat is simply performing according to the terms of the contract.

\section{Answer to Question 178}

(A) Deanna is not guilty of larceny of the computer because her mistake prevented her from having the requisite mens rea for larceny. Larceny requires an intent to permanently deprive another of her interest in the property taken. Deanna did not have such an intent because she believed that the computer was her own and that Vanessa had no possessory interest in it. Therefore, she did not have the intent required for larceny. $(\mathrm{B})$ is wrong because Deanna's mistake need not have been reasonable. When mistake is offered to negate the existence of general intent or malice, it must be a reasonable mistake. However, any mistake of fact, reasonable or unreasonable, is a defense to a specific intent crime, and larceny is a specific intent crime. (C) is wrong because, as stated above, she did not have the intent to deprive Vanessa of Vanessa's computer; her mistake negates such an intent. (D) is incorrect because the "continuing trespass" doctrine is inapplicable. While larceny generally requires that the intent to deprive another person of her interest in the property must have existed at the moment of the taking of the property, the continuing trespass doctrine provides that if a defendant takes property with a wrongful state of mind but without the intent to steal, and later forms the intent to steal it, the trespass involved in the initial wrongful taking is regarded as "continuing" and the defendant is guilty of larceny. However, this doctrine has no application if the defendant's initial taking of the property, although trespassory, was not motivated by a wrongful state of mind. Here, Deanna took Vanessa's computer as a result of an innocent mistake. Even if she decides to keep the computer, she will not be guilty of larceny because her initial taking was done with an innocent state of mind.

\section{Answer to Question 179}

(B) Walter's testimony is admissible to show the effect of the statement on Dent's state of mind. A statement is hearsay if it is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. If the statement is offered for another purpose, it is not considered a hearsay statement. Statements offered for the purpose of showing the effect on the listener are generally not classified as hearsay. Thus, (B) is correct, and (C) is wrong. (A) is wrong; the statements are not hearsay, and the state of mind exception applies to the state of mind of the speaker. (D) is wrong. Clearly, if Dent heard the statement, that would tend to establish the fear necessary for a self-defense claim.

\section{Answer to Question 180}

(C) Because the appropriation by the village council implicates the Establishment Clause and a portion of Curmudgeon's taxes are paying for the appropriation, the Court should entertain his suit. The Supreme Court will not decide a constitutional challenge to a government action unless the person who is challenging it has standing to raise the constitutional issue. To have standing, a person must be able to assert that he is injured by a government program. This injury must be more than the merely theoretical injury that all persons suffer by seeing their government engage in unconstitutional actions. In cases where a taxpayer is claiming injury from the use of his taxes for an unconstitutional appropriation or expenditure of public funds, the Supreme Court has required the taxpayer to show that the challenged measure (i) was enacted under the governmental body's power to tax and spend (rather than as an incidental expenditure in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute), and (ii) exceeds some specific limitation on that power. The only specific limitation that the Court has recognized when an appropriation measure has been challenged is the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. [See Flast v. Cohen (1968)] Here, Curmudgeon is challenging a specific appropriation of money by the village council that has been earmarked to benefit the property of the local church. The Establishment Clause, which is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that government programs (i) must have a secular purpose, (ii) must have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (iii) must not produce excessive government entanglement with religion. Because the council's appropriation may violate these requirements, Curmudgeon has standing as a taxpayer to sue the council. (A) is incorrect even though the portion of Curmudgeon's taxes that would be used for the appropriation is minimal. While this factor has been relied on by the Supreme Court in its general refusal to grant federal and state taxpayers standing, it has not been used to deny municipal taxpayers standing in federal courts. [See Asarco, Inc. v. Kadish (1989)] Furthermore, the Court has carved out a narrow exception for federal taxpayers to challenge an appropriation, despite the fact that any one taxpayer's contribution would be minute and indeterminable, where the measure was enacted under Congress's taxing and spending powers and violates the Establishment Clause (as discussed above). This exception would be equally applicable to the village council's appropriation here if the court were to follow the federal taxpayer approach. Thus, the minimal contribution by Curmudgeon's taxes would be irrelevant. (B) is incorrect because it does not recognize the limited exception discussed above. (D) is incorrect because generally taxpayers do not have standing to sue on constitutional grounds. The Supreme Court has not expanded the standing rules beyond what Flast $v$. Cohen had established.

\section{Answer to Question 181}

(D) Landesmann can recover all of his damages. Where two or more tortious acts combine to proximately cause an indivisible injury to a plaintiff, each tortfeasor will be jointly and severally liable for that injury. This is so even though each defendant acted entirely independently. Here, the tortious acts of Acorp and Beeco combined to proximately cause the poisoning of Landesmann's cattle. Thus, each company will be jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of Landesmann's damages. Thus, (D) is correct. (A) is wrong. Where two or more acts combine to cause the injury, but none of the acts standing alone would be sufficient, each of the acts is an actual cause of the injury (because but for either of the acts, the injury would not have occurred). Thus, Landesmann can recover because the combined actions of the defendants caused his injury. (B) is wrong because to recover Landesmann need not show the amount of fault of each defendant. (C) is wrong because, as mentioned, in this type of case the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the entire injury.

\section{Answer to Question 182}

(B) Barton's right to purchase is a preemptive option, which is subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities. If the option could be exercised more than 21 years after some life in being at its creation, it is void. Obviously, Barton's right to purchase will vest or fail within 21 years after Amato's death. Thus, the Rule's provisions are satisfied. (D) is incorrect because a preemptive right, such as is held by Barton, is not so onerous a restriction on transfer of property as to constitute an unreasonable restraint on alienation. (A) is incorrect because recordation is not essential to the validity of the instrument, as between the grantor and grantee. Recordation merely gives notice to the world that an interest affecting title has been conveyed. (C) is incorrect because there is no prohibition against the owner of property conveying her property so that it will pass outside of her will. Here, Amato has chosen freely to dispose of Riveracre in the manner described, and her choice will be given effect.

\section{Answer to Question 183}

(A) Pretrial familiarization of a signature by a nonexpert is not an accepted method of authentication because lay opinion as to the authenticity of handwriting must be based on personal familiarity with the handwriting. Here, the nonexpert's only familiarity with Drake's usual signature has come from pretrial preparation. An expert witness or the trier of fact can determine the genuineness of a writing by comparing the questioned writing with another writing proved to be genuine. Thus, (B) would be an accepted method of authenticating Drake's signature. (C) is an accepted method of authentication because it describes the requirements under the Federal Rules for authentication of an ancient document. (D) is acceptable as an admission by a party-opponenti.e., a prior acknowledgment by one of the parties of a relevant fact.

\section{Answer to Question 184}

(D) If Dennison believed that the building was abandoned, he probably will not be found to have the requisite mens rea for murder. Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought exists when the defendant has (i) intent to kill, (ii) intent to inflict great bodily injury, (iii) reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life ("abandoned and malignant heart"), or (iv) intent to commit a felony (under the felony murder doctrine). Here, the jury could find that spraying a building with submachine gun fire demonstrates a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life even though Dennison was not intending to shoot anyone. However, if the jury accepts his assertion that he believed that the building was abandoned and had no idea that there would be any people inside it, the jury will probably find that he did not have a sufficient awareness of an unjustifiably high risk to human life to be liable for murder. (A) is not as strong a defense as (D) because Dennison may still be found liable for the murder as an accomplice. Dennison will be an accomplice to the drive-by shooting even if he was only the driver because he assisted the principal in the commission of the crime and had the intent to do so. An accomplice is liable not only for the crime he intended to aid but also for any other crimes committed during commission of the intended crime if the other crimes were probable or foreseeable. Here, even though the Assassins knew that the store was closed, a jury could find that it was foreseeable that someone would be killed when they sprayed the building with submachine gun fire. Even if Dennison was only the driver, his best defense would be his belief that the building was abandoned. (B) is incorrect because Dennison's voluntary intoxication would not be a defense to a murder charge that was based on reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. Voluntary intoxication caused by alcohol or drugs is a defense to a crime that requires purpose (intent) or knowledge as long as the intoxication prevents the defendant from formulating the purpose or obtaining the knowledge. It is no defense to crimes involving recklessness or negligence, however. Even though recklessness requires a conscious disregard of the risk, and the defendant's intoxication may make him unaware of the risk, courts hold him liable for recklessness offenses because his initial act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated was reckless. Thus, for murder based on a malice aforethought of reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life, voluntary intoxication would not be a defense. (C) is wrong because duress is not a defense to murder. A criminal offense may be excused if the defendant does the act under threat of imminent infliction of death or great bodily harm, as long as the defendant reasonably believes that the threat will be carried out. However, no threat will suffice as a defense to a homicide crime. Dennison may still be liable for murder if he acted with an awareness of an unjustifiably high risk to human life.

\section{Answer to Question 185}

(A) Hull acquired title to Brownacre by adverse possession. He possessed the property for longer than the required 10 years. Although Hull entered Brownacre without Orris's knowledge, he dealt with the property in such a manner as to put the true owner and the community on notice of the fact of his possession. Also, Hull's possession was continuous, exclusive, and hostile. Thus, the elements of adverse possession are present. Because Orris lost title to the land due to Hull's adverse possession, it follows that $(\mathrm{B}$ ) is incorrect. (D) is incorrect because Powell, who supposedly took title to Brownacre by a quitclaim deed from Orris, cannot take title from someone who had none to convey. (C) is incorrect because Burns never possessed the land for the requisite statutory period. Also, he did not hold the land in a hostile manner for a continuous period.

\section{Answer to Question 186}

(A) Under the concept of fixtures, the dam was converted from personalty into realty. The dam is an accessory to the land and passes with the ownership of the land. (A) expresses this fact. (B) is wrong because the document purporting to transfer Hull's interest in the dam to Burns was insufficient to transfer real property. (C) is an incorrect statement of the law. (D) is wrong because the dam, as an accessory to the land, belongs to the owner of the land.

\section{Answer to Question 187}

(D) The provision is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has found "legislative vetoes" to be unconstitutional because they are not subject to presidential review and they violate the separation of powers guaranteed by the federal Constitution. The mechanism set up here has even less basis for constitutionality because the legislative veto that the Supreme Court held unconstitutional at least envisioned votes by one or both full houses of Congress (rather than a mere committee). (A) is incorrect because the Necessary and Proper Clause does not allow Congress to exceed its powers or violate the separation of powers. It merely allows Congress to adopt laws necessary and proper to the powers granted by the Constitution. (B) is incorrect because there is no such rule. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has generally abandoned the "privileges vs. rights" dichotomy. (C) is incorrect because the Equal Protection Clause applies only to actions by the states. Moreover, since no fundamental right or suspect class is involved, the discrimination here would be upheld as long as it is rational.

\section{Answer to Question 188}

(C) Title to Brownacre is vested half in Tenniel, free of the mortgage, and half in Stokes subject to the mortgage. Because the jurisdiction in which Brownacre is located recognizes the title theory of mortgages, Johnson's execution of the mortgage on Brownacre effected a severance of the joint tenancy, by passing a title interest from Johnson to Lowden. Following severance of the joint tenancy, Johnson and Tenniel held as tenants in common, with no right of survivorship. The interest of a tenant in common passes by succession. When Johnson died, Tenniel could not take Brownacre by right of survivorship, because of the severance of the joint tenancy. Thus, (A) and (B) are incorrect. Upon Johnson's death, Stokes succeeded to his interest in Brownacre, subject to the mortgage. However, Tenniel's interest in the property, as a tenant in common, is not subject to the mortgage. Therefore, (D) is incorrect and (C) is correct.

\section{Answer to Question 189}

(B) Both damages and an injunction would be ordered. Church has a life estate pur autre vie, and a life tenant as a general rule is not entitled to consume or exploit natural resources on the property; this constitutes affirmative (voluntary) waste that injures the interests of the future interest holders. Any award of damages will be held until the class gift to the grandchildren closes at Carl's death. (A) is wrong since the church's action did not terminate its interest. The "provided that" language creates a condition subsequent. An estate subject to a condition subsequent does not terminate automatically on the happening of the condition. To terminate, the grantor must exercise a right of entry, and here no right of entry was reserved. (C) is wrong because it is entirely unnecessary for Omar and Carl to be parties, since neither of them has any interest in the land. Omar has given up his interest entirely, and Carl is present in the conveyance only to serve as a measuring life for the life estate; he owns no interest in the land itself. (D) is wrong because the injury to the land is permanent and therefore should be prevented by an injunction.

\section{Answer to Question 190}

(D) Defendant acted in self-defense and, therefore, should not be convicted of a homicide. A person may use deadly force in self-defense if: (i) he is without fault; (ii) he is confronted with unlawful force; and (iii) he is threatened with imminent death or great bodily harm. All three elements are present under these facts. Because Vincent initiated the attack, he will be considered the aggressor, and Defendant will be deemed "without fault." Mere teasing words should not be sufficient to deem Defendant the aggressor, but even if the words were such a provocation, Vincent's sudden escalation of the fight into one involving deadly force would allow Defendant to use force in his own defense. Unlawful force is defined as force that constitutes a crime or a tort. Vincent's attack with the metal bar so qualifies. The defendant must reasonably believe that he is threatened with imminent death or great bodily harm if he does not respond with deadly force. Defendant had such a reasonable belief. Furthermore, Defendant had no duty to retreat under the prevailing rule. It follows that (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect, because Defendant's use of deadly force was justified by self-defense. 

\section{Answer to Question 191}

(A) Since White persists in refusing to testify as to matters covered in his earlier testimony, he should be considered "unavailable" at Dean's trial. Thus, his former testimony should be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. It will be considered to be trustworthy since it was given during formal proceedings, under oath, and subject to cross-examination. (B) is wrong because this is not the applicable exception to the hearsay rule. In this case there is no evidence that White does not presently remember the facts in question. (C) is wrong because White could have asserted his privilege against self-incrimination when the former testimony was given. He can assert his privilege at present to keep from testifying. (D) is wrong because there is an applicable exception to the hearsay rule.

\section{Answer to Question 192}

(D) Having created a forum generally open for use by all groups, Hometown must justify its exclusions therefrom under applicable constitutional norms. To justify discriminatory exclusion from a public forum based on the religious content of a group's intended speech, Hometown must show that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end. Alternative (B) suggests that the ordinance serves the compelling interest of maintaining separation of church and state. However, the former "equal access" policy did not offend the Establishment Clause. The former policy had a secular purpose (providing a forum in which citizens can exchange ideas); it avoided excessive entanglement with religion; and it did not have a primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion (permitting religious groups to use the auditorium would result in, at most, an incidental benefit). Thus, (B) is incorrect. (A) is incorrect because an unjustified content-based exclusion of religious speech is not made more acceptable by virtue of the fact that it treats all religions equally. (C) is incorrect because, although there is no authoritative constitutional definition of religion, it is unlikely that the term "religious groups" will be deemed to be impermissibly vague.

\section{Answer to Question 193}

(A) Light Company had notice that the insulators were being destroyed, causing the power lines to fall. Certainly, it was foreseeable that children, or anyone else, in the vicinity of a fallen line might be injured by such a dangerous condition. Consequently, Light Company had a duty to take reasonable steps, if possible, to prevent the lines from falling. Breach of this duty will lay the foundation for a recovery by Paul. (B) is simply an incorrect statement of the law. (C) is incorrect because, even if the company took measures to stop the destruction of the insulators, it also had a duty to take precautions against the danger of falling power lines. (D) is incorrect because Light Company had a duty to make its operations safe in light of the destruction of which it had notice. This is true even though the destruction was intentional. Criminal acts and intentional torts of third persons are not superseding forces where they are foreseeable, such as here.

\section{Answer to Question 194}

(D) Generally, an existing violation of a zoning ordinance renders title unmarketable. Here, the location of the house in relation to the side line setback exposes Perrine to the threat of litigation, both for violation of the zoning ordinance and for violation of a restriction in the recorded subdivision plot. Regardless of the likelihood that such litigation may be initiated, and of the likelihood that Perrine would ultimately prevail, he cannot be required to "buy a lawsuit." Thus, (D) is the correct answer. It follows that (A) and (B) are incorrect. (C) is incorrect because it fails to address the issue of unmarketability of title through exposure to potential litigation, which forms the basis for Perrine's refusal to consummate the transaction.

\section{Answer to Question 195}

(B) Restrictions on the ability of persons to be candidates may violate the First Amendment rights of speech and political association or the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court uses a balancing test in determining whether a regulation of the electoral process is valid: if the restriction on First Amendment activities is severe, it will be upheld only if it is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest, but if the restriction is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, it generally will be upheld on the basis of the state's important regulatory interests. Thus, if the ballot restriction here is deemed to be a severe and unreasonable burden on independent candidates, Roderick's best argument is choice (B) - that the objectives of the statute could be satisfactorily achieved by less burdensome means. [See Norman v. Reed (1992)] A state may require that independent candidates obtain a reasonable number of signatures. Although such a requirement may be burdensome, that factor alone does not make it invalid. Thus, (A) is not as strong an argument as (B). (D) is incorrect because signature requirements may be justified by a state interest in assuring that candidates have at least minimal support before they are allowed to appear on the ballot. (C) is incorrect because the fact that few independent candidates have obtained ballot status may simply reflect the absence of even the minimal popular support which the state may legitimately require.

\section{Answer to Question 196}

(C) Miranda warnings are required only where the accused has made a statement during custodial interrogation. Barber voluntarily complied with a request to come to police headquarters, where he was not arrested and was free to leave. During his discussion with the police officers, he voluntarily made a spontaneous inculpatory statement. Thus, he was not entitled to Miranda warnings, and (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because, in circumstances such as these, the right to counsel would attach only if there was a custodial police interrogation. "Interrogation" refers not only to express questioning, but also to other words or actions reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. However, routine questions that the police had no reason to believe would elicit an incriminating response do not constitute an interrogation. Also, there is no due process violation arising from the making of a free and voluntary statement. (D) is incorrect primarily because Barber was not entitled to Miranda warnings simply by visiting the police station. Thus, he had nothing to waive. However, even if Barber was entitled to the warnings, the facts do not indicate a waiver. A waiver must be knowing, voluntary and intelligent. Merely agreeing to visit police headquarters does not constitute a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of Miranda warnings.

\section{Answer to Question 197}

(D) Garrison is liable by virtue of his negligence, and Astin is vicariously liable for Garrison's negligence by virtue of the statute. Where such joint liability exists, the plaintiff may recover the entire judgment amount from either defendant. Further, where one is held liable for damages caused by another simply because of his relationship to that person (i.e., vicarious liability), such person may seek indemnification from the person whose conduct actually caused the damage. Applying the foregoing principles to the facts of this question, Placek may recover the entire $\$ 100,000$ from Astin and Garrison jointly. This eliminates (A) and (B). Because Astin is only liable vicariously, she is entitled to indemnification from Garrison for any amount collected from Astin by Placek. Therefore, (D) is the correct answer and (C) is incorrect. 

\section{Answer to Question 198}

(B) If the Smiths had a reasonable (i.e., good faith) belief in the enforceability of their claim, their surrender of the claim is valid consideration. (A) is wrong because the reason they made the gift is immaterial if neither Herb nor Edna deliberately misled them. (C) is irrelevant because the accounts were held in joint tenancy and any interest Edna may have had in the funds ended when she died. (D) is wrong because there was no consideration given for Edna's promise and the fact that it was in writing does not change the lack of consideration.

\section{Answer to Question 199}

(D) If the Smiths have given up a good faith claim, their agreement with Herb is a compromise supported by valid consideration. Thus, there is an enforceable contract. (A) is wrong because Herb was requesting a promise from the Smiths, not an act. (B) is wrong because Herb was under no obligation to reject a gift if he did not deliberately induce the Smiths to give it. (C) is wrong because there is no evidence that the Smiths gave the food in reliance on any promise made by Herb.

\section{Answer to Question 200}

(A) Walter's testimony, although hearsay, should be admissible under the exception for present sense impressions. Hearsay is defined under the Federal Rules as "a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted." Walter's testimony as to what Vincent said on the phone is hearsay: Vincent's statement that "Dornbach is here" is being offered in evidence by someone other than Vincent to prove that Dornbach was present at Vincent's house shortly before he was killed. Walter's testimony is therefore not admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 802 unless an exception to the hearsay rule applies. Rule 803(1) recognizes an exception for a statement "describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter." Because the statement is made concurrently with the event it is describing, it is safe from defects in memory and there is usually little or no time for calculated misstatements. Here, Vincent's statement that "Dornbach is here" was made to Walter immediately after he went to the door and perceived Dornbach to be there. Thus, the statement is Vincent's present sense impression that Walter may testify to at trial. (B) is incorrect because Vincent's statement is not being offered to show his state of mind or his intent to do something in the future. The prosecution is using Vincent's statement simply to establish Dornbach's presence at Vincent's house the day he was killed. (C) is wrong because the prior identification must be by the witness testifying at trial to be admissible. Had Vincent survived an attempted homicide and testified at Dornbach's trial, Fed. R. Evid. 801(d) $(1)(\mathrm{C})$ would permit his prior statement to Walter identifying Dornbach to be admitted as nonhearsay and substantive evidence. (D) is incorrect. While the testimony is hearsay, it falls within the exception to the hearsay rule for present sense impressions. 

\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW QUESTIONS}

\section{Question 1}

A newly enacted criminal statute provides, in its entirety, "No person shall utter to another person in a public place any annoying, disturbing or unwelcome language." Smith followed an elderly woman for three blocks down a public street, yelling in her ear offensive four-letter words. The woman repeatedly asked Smith to leave her alone, but he refused.

In the subsequent prosecution of Smith, the first under this statute, Smith will:

(A) Not prevail.

(B) Prevail, because speech of the sort described here may not be punished by the state because of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

(C) Prevail, because though his speech may be punished by the state, the state may not do so under this statute.

(D) Prevail, because the average user of a public street would think his speech/action here was amusing and ridiculous rather than "annoying," etc.

\section{Question 2}

Congressional legislation regulating the conditions for marriages and divorces would be most likely upheld if it:

(A) Applied only to marriages and divorces by members of the armed services.

(B) Applied only to marriages performed by federal judges and to divorces granted by federal courts.

(C) Implemented an executive agreement seeking to define basic human rights.

(D) Applied only to marriages and divorces in the District of Columbia.

\section{Question 3}

Assume for the purposes of this question that you are counsel to the state legislative committee that is responsible for real estate laws in your state. The committee wants you to $\mathrm{draft}$ legislation to make all restrictions on land use, imposed by deeds (now or hereafter recorded), unenforceable in the future so that public landuse planning through zoning will have exclusive control in matters of land use.

Which of the following is least likely to be a consideration in the drafting of such legislation?

(A) Compensation for property rights taken by public authority.

(B) Impairment of contract.

(C) Sovereign immunity.

(D) Police power.

Questions 4-6 are based on the following fact situation:

Congress provides by statute that any state that fails to prohibit automobile speeds of over 55 miles per hour on highways within the state shall be denied federal highway construction funding. The state of Atlantic, one of the richest and most highway-oriented states in the country, refuses to enact such a statute.

4. Which of the following potential plaintiffs is most likely to be able to obtain a judicial determination of the validity of this federal statute?

(A) A taxpayer of the United States and the state of Atlantic who wants his state to get its fair share of his tax monies for highways, and fears that, if it does not, his state taxes will be increased to pay for the highway construction in the state of Atlantic that federal funds would have financed.

(B) Contractors who have been awarded contracts by the state of Atlantic for specified highway construction projects, which contracts are contingent on payment to the state of the federal funds to which it would otherwise be entitled. (C) An automobile owner who lives in the state of Atlantic and regularly uses its highway system.

(D) An organization dedicated to keeping the federal government within the powers granted it by the Constitution.

5. The best argument that can be made in support of the constitutionality of this federal statute is that:

(A) The states conceded their authority over highways to the national government when the states accepted federal grants to help finance the highways.

(B) The federal government can regulate the use of state highways without limitation because the federal government paid for most of their construction costs.

(C) Reasonable legislators could believe that the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit will ensure that the federal money spent on highways results in greater benefit than harm to the public.

(D) A recent public opinion survey demonstrates that $90 \%$ of the people in this country support a 55 mile-perhour speed limit.

6. The federal statute relating to disbursement of highway funds, conditioned on the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit, is probably:

(A) Unconstitutional.

(B) Constitutional only on the basis of the spending power.

(C) Constitutional only on the basis of the commerce power.

(D) Constitutional on the basis of both the spending power and the commerce power. Questions 7-8 are based on the following fact situation:

A recently enacted state law forbids nonresident aliens from owning more than 100 acres of land within the state and directs the state attorney general to bring an action of ejectment whenever a nonresident alien owns such land. Zane, a nonresident alien, has obtained title to 200 acres of land in the state, and he brings an action in federal court to enjoin the state attorney general from enforcing the statute. The defendant moves to dismiss the complaint.

7. The best argument for Zane is that:

(A) States are forbidden by the Commerce Clause from interfering with the rights of nonresidents to own land.

(B) The state's power to restrict alien rights is limited by the federal power to control foreign relations.

(C) The state statute adversely affects Zane's right to travel.

(D) The 100-acre restriction means that aliens cannot engage in farming operations requiring larger amounts of land.

8. The federal court should:

(A) Dismiss the action, because under the Constitution, nonresident aliens may not sue in federal court.

(B) Dismiss the action, because a state has plenary power to determine the qualifications for landholding within its boundaries.

(C) Hear the action, because the United Nations Charter forbids such discrimination.

(D) Hear the action, because a federal question is presented. 

\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 433.}

\section{Question 9}

Zall, a resident of the state of Paxico, brought suit in federal district court against Motors, Inc., a Paxico corporation. Zall seeks recovery of $\$ 12,000$ actual and $\$ 12,000$ punitive damages arising from Motors's sale to him of a defective automobile. Zall's suit is based only on a common law contract theory.

From a constitutional standpoint, should the federal district court hear this suit on its merits?

(A) Yes, because Article III vests federal courts with jurisdiction over cases involving the obligation of contracts.

(B) Yes, because it is an action affecting interstate commerce.

(C) No, because this suit is not within the jurisdiction of an Article III court.

(D) No, because there is no case or controversy within the meaning of Article III.

Questions 10-11 are based on the following fact situation:

The state of Missoula has enacted a new election code designed to increase voter responsibility in the exercise of the franchise and to enlarge citizen participation in the electoral process. None of its provisions conflict with federal statutes.

10. Which of the following is the strongest reason for finding unconstitutional a requirement in the Missoula election code that each voter must be literate in English?

(A) The requirement violates Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, which provides that representatives to Congress be chosen "by the people of the several States."

(B) The requirement violates Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to "make or alter" state regulations providing for the "times" and "manner" of holding elections for senators and representatives.

(C) The requirement violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(D) The requirement violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

11. The Missoula election code provides that in a special-purpose election for directors of a state watershed improvement district, the franchise is limited to landowners within the district, because they are the only ones directly affected by the outcome. Each vote is weighted according to the proportion of the holding of that individual in relation to the total affected property. The best argument in support of the statute and against the application of the "one person, one vote" principle in this situation is that the principle:

(A) Applies only to election of individuals to statewide public office.

(B) Does not apply where property rights are involved.

(C) Does not apply because the actions of such a district principally affect landowners.

(D) Does not apply because of rights reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.

Questions 12-14 are based on the following fact situation:

The state of Yuma provides by statute, "No person may be awarded any state construction contract without agreeing to employ only citizens of the state and of the United States in performance of the contract."

12. In evaluating the constitutionality of this state statute under the Supremacy Clause, which of the following would be most directly relevant?
(A) The general unemployment rate in the nation.
(B) The treaties and immigration laws of the United States.
(C) The need of the state for this particular statute.
(D) The number of aliens currently resid- ing in Yuma.

13. If the Yuma statute is attacked as violating the Commerce Clause, which of the following defenses is the weakest?
(A) The statute will help protect the workers of the state of Yuma from competition by foreign workers.
(B) The statute will help ensure that workers with jobs directly affecting the performance of public contracts are dedicated to their jobs.
(C) The statute will help ensure a continu- ously available and stable work force for the execution of public contracts.
(D) The statute will help ensure that only the most qualified individuals work on public contracts.

14. Suppose the state supreme court declares the statute to be unconstitutional on the ground that it violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the state constitution. If the state seeks review in the United States Supreme Court, which of the following statements is most accurate?
(A) The United States Supreme Court may properly review that decision by certiorari only.
(B) The United States Supreme Court may properly review that decision by appeal only.
(C) The United States Supreme Court may properly review that decision by appeal or certiorari.
(D) The United States Supreme Court may not properly review that decision.

Questions 15-16 are based on the following fact situation:

The state of Champlain enacts the Young Adult Marriage Counseling Act, which provides that, before any persons less than 30 years of age may be issued a marriage license, they must receive at least five hours of marriage counseling from a state-licensed social worker. This counseling is designed to ensure that applicants for marriage licenses know their legal rights and duties in relation to marriage and parenthood, understand the "true nature" of the marriage relationship, and understand the procedures for obtaining divorces.

15. Pine, aged 25 , contemplates marrying Ross, aged 25. Both are residents of the state of Champlain. Pine has not yet proposed to Ross because he is offended by the counseling requirement.

Pine sues in federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Young Adult Marriage Counseling Act is unconstitutional. Which of the following is the clearest ground for dismissal of this action by the court?
(A) Pine and Ross are residents of the same state.
(B) No substantial federal question is presented.
(C) The suit presents a nonjusticiable political question.
(D) The suit is unripe.

16. In a case in which the constitutionality of the Young Adult Marriage Counseling Act is in issue, the burden of persuasion will probably be on the: (A) Person challenging the law, because there is a strong presumption that elected state legislators acted properly.

(B) Person challenging the law, because the Tenth Amendment authorizes states to determine the conditions on which they issue marriage licenses.

(C) State, because there is a substantial impact on the right to marry, and that right is fundamental.

(D) State, because there is a substantial impact on the discrete and insular class of young adults.

\section{Question 17}

A statute of the state of Tuscarora made it a misdemeanor to construct any building of more than five stories without an automatic fire sprinkler system.

A local construction company built, in Tuscarora, a 10-story federal office building. It constructed the building according to the precise specifications of a federal contract authorized by federal statutes. Because the building was built without the automatic fire sprinkler system required by state law, Tuscarora prosecutes the private contractor.

Which of the following is the company's strongest defense to that prosecution?

(A) The state sprinkler requirement denies the company property or liberty without due process.

(B) The state sprinkler requirement denies the company equal protection of the laws.

(C) As applied, the state sprinkler requirement violates the Supremacy Clause.

(D) As applied, the state sprinkler requirement violates the Obligation of Contracts Clause.

\section{Question 18}

A state accredits both public and private schools, licenses their teachers, and supplies textbooks on secular subjects to all such schools. Country Schoolhouse, a private school that offers elementary and secondary education in the state, denies admission to all non-Caucasians.

In a suit to enjoin as unconstitutional the continued racially exclusionary admissions policy of the Country Schoolhouse, which of the following is the strongest argument against the school?

(A) Because education is a public function, the Country Schoolhouse may not discriminate on racial grounds.

(B) The state is so involved in school regulation and support that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is applicable to the school.

(C) The state is constitutionally obligated to eliminate segregation in all public and private educational institutions within the state.

(D) Any school with teachers who are licensed by the state is forbidden to discriminate on racial grounds.

\section{Question 19}

A federal statute requires United States civil service employees to retire at age 75 . However, that statute also states that civil service employees of the armed forces must retire at age 65 .

Prentis, a 65-year-old civil service employee of the Department of the Army, seeks a declaratory judgment that would forbid his mandatory retirement until age 75 .

The strongest argument that Prentis can make to invalidate the requirement that he retire at age 65 is that the law: (A) Denies him a privilege or immunity of national citizenship.

(B) Deprives him of a property right without just compensation.

(C) Is not within the scope of any of the enumerated powers of Congress in Article I, Section 8.

(D) Invidiously discriminates against him on the basis of age in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

\section{Question 20}

Congress passes a law regulating the wholesale and retail prices of "every purchase or sale of oil, natural gas, and electric power made in the United States."

The strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of this statute is that:

(A) The Constitution expressly empowers Congress to enact laws for "the general welfare."

(B) Congress has the authority to regulate such products' interstate transportation and importation from abroad.

(C) Congress may regulate the prices of every purchase and sale of goods and services made in this country, because commerce includes buying and selling.

(D) In inseverable aggregates, the domestic purchases or sales of such products affect interstate or foreign commerce.

\section{Question 21}

Congress enacted a statute providing that persons may challenge a state energy law on the ground that it is in conflict with the federal Constitution in either federal or state court. According to this federal statute, any decision by a lower state court upholding a state energy law against a challenge based on the federal Constitution may be appealed directly to the United States Supreme Court.

The provisions of this statute that authorize direct United States Supreme Court review of specified decisions rendered by lower state courts are:

(A) Constitutional, because congressional control over questions of energy use is plenary.

(B) Constitutional, because Congress may establish the manner by which the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court is exercised.

(C) Unconstitutional, because they infringe the sovereign right of states to have their supreme courts review decisions of their lower state courts.

(D) Unconstitutional, because under Article III of the Constitution, the United States Supreme Court does not have authority to review directly decisions of lower state courts.

\section{Question 22}

Congress enacts a criminal statute prohibiting "any person from interfering in any way with any right conferred on another person by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."

Application of this statute to Jones, a private citizen, would be most clearly constitutional if Jones, with threats of violence, coerces:
(A) A public school teacher to exclude black pupils from her class, solely because of their race.
(B) Black pupils, solely because of their race, to refrain from attending a privately owned and operated school licensed by the state.
(C) The bus driver operating a free school bus service under the sponsorship of a local church to refuse to allow black pupils on the bus, solely because of their race.
(D) The federal official in charge of distributing certain federal benefits directly to students from distributing them to black pupils, solely because of their race. Questions 23-24 are based on the following fact situation:

All lawyers practicing in the state of Erewhon must be members of the State Bar Association, by order of the state supreme court. Several state officials serve on the Bar Association's Board of Bar Governors. The Board of Bar Governors authorizes the payment of dues for two staff members to the Cosmopolitan Club, a private dining club licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. The Cosmopolitan Club is frequented by affluent businessmen and professionals and by legislators. It is generally known that the purpose of the membership of the Bar Association staff is to enable them to go where members of the "elite" meet and to lobby for legislation in which the Bar Association is interested. The State Association has numerous committees and subcommittees concerned with family law, real estate law, unauthorized practice, etc., and its recommendations often influence state policy. Some committee meetings are held at the Cosmopolitan Club. The club is known to have rules which restrict membership by race, religion, and sex.

Plaintiffs, husband and wife, who are members of the Erewhon Bar Association, petition the Board of Bar Governors to adopt a resolution prohibiting the payment of club dues to and the holding of meetings of the Bar Association or its committees at places that discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or sex. After substantial public discussion, the Board of Bar Governors, by a close vote, fails to pass such a resolution. These events receive extensive coverage in the local newspapers. Plaintiffs bring an action in federal court seeking an injunction against such payments and the holding of meetings in such places as the Cosmopolitan Club.

23. The strongest argument for Plaintiffs is:

(A) Private rights to discriminate and associate freely must defer to a public interest against discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or sex.

(B) The failure of the State Bar Association to pass a resolution forbidding discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or sex constitutes a denial of equal protection.

(C) The State Bar Association is an agency of the state and its payment of dues to such private clubs promotes discrimination on the basis of race, religion, and sex.

(D) The State Bar Association's payment of dues to such private clubs promotes discrimination on the basis of race, religion, and sex.

24. Which of the following actions should a federal district court take with respect to jurisdiction?

(A) Hear the case on the merits, because a federal claim is presented.

(B) Hear the case on the merits, because the expenditure of state funds in support of segregation is forbidden by the Fifth Amendment.

(C) Abstain from jurisdiction, because the constitutional issue should be litigated first in a state court.

(D) Dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction, because the issue of Bar Association activities is solely within the domain of state law.

\section{Question 25}

Congress enacts a statute punishing "each and every conspiracy entered into by any two or more persons for the purpose of denying black persons housing, employment, or education, solely because of their race."

Under which of the following constitutional provisions is the authority of Congress to pass such a statute most clearly and easily justifiable?
(A) The Obligation of Contracts Clause.
(B) The General Welfare Clause of Article I, Section 8. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}
(C) The Thirteenth Amendment.
(D) The Fourteenth Amendment.

\section{Question 26}

A federal criminal law makes it a crime for any citizen of the United States not specifically authorized by the President to negotiate with a foreign government for the purpose of influencing the foreign government in relation to a dispute with the United States.

The strongest constitutional ground for the validity of this law is that:

(A) Under several of its enumerated powers, Congress may legislate to preserve the monopoly of the national government over the conduct of United States foreign affairs.

(B) The President's inherent power to negotiate for the United States with foreign countries authorizes the President, even in the absence of statutory authorization, to punish citizens who engage in such negotiations without permission.

(C) The law deals with foreign relations and therefore is not governed by the First Amendment.

(D) Federal criminal laws dealing with international affairs need not be as specific as those dealing with domestic affairs.

\section{Question 27}

A state statute requires that all buses which operate as common carriers on the highways of the state shall be equipped with seat belts for passengers. Transport Lines, an interstate carrier, challenges the validity of the statute and the right of the state to make the requirement.

What is the best basis for a constitutional challenge by Transport Lines?

(A) Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (B) Violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

(C) Unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.

(D) Difficulty of enforcement.

\section{Question 28}

Congress passes an act requiring that all owners of bicycles in the United States register them with a federal bicycle registry. The purpose of the law is to provide reliable evidence of ownership to reduce bicycle theft. No fee is charged for the registration. Although most stolen bicycles are kept or resold by the thieves in the same cities in which the bicycles were stolen, an increasing number of bicycles are being taken to cities in other states for resale.

Is this act of Congress constitutional?

(A) Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.

(B) Yes, because Congress could determine that, in inseverable aggregates, bicycle thefts affect interstate commerce.

(C) No, because most stolen bicycles remain within the state in which they were stolen.

(D) No, because the registration of vehicles is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.

\section{Question 29}

A statute of the state of Lanape flatly bans the sale or distribution of contraceptive devices to minors. Drugs, Inc., a national retailer of drugs and related items, is charged with violating the Lanape statute.

Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument Drugs, Inc., could make in defending itself against prosecution for violation of this statute?

(A) The statute constitutes an undue burden on interstate commerce. (B) The statute denies minors one of their fundamental rights without due process.

(C) The statute denies Drugs, Inc., a privilege or immunity of state citizenship.

(D) The statute violates the First Amendment right to freedom of religion because it regulates morals.

\section{Question 30}

Congress enacted a law prohibiting the killing, capture, or removal of any form of wildlife upon or from any federally owned land.

Which of the following is the most easily justifiable source of national authority for this federal law?
(A) The Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8.
(B) The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.
(C) The Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(D) The Property Clause of Article IV, Section 3.

\section{Question 31}

The President of the United States recognizes the country of Ruritania and undertakes diplomatic relations with its government through the Secretary of State. Ruritania is governed by a repressive totalitarian government.

In an appropriate federal court, Dunn brings a suit against the President and Secretary of State to set aside this action on the ground that it is inconsistent with the principles of our constitutional form of government. Dunn has a lucrative contract with the United States Department of Commerce to provide commercial information about Ruritania. The contract expressly terminates, however, "when the President recognizes the country of Ruritania and undertakes diplomatic relations with its government." Which of the following is the most proper disposition of the Dunn suit by the federal court?
(A) Suit dismissed, because Dunn does not have standing to bring this action.
(B) Suit dismissed, because there is no adver- sity between Dunn and the defendants.
(C) Suit dismissed, because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.
(D) Suit decided on the merits.

\section{Question 32}

Congress passes an Energy Conservation Act. The Act requires all users of energy in this country to reduce their consumption by a specified percentage, to be set by a presidential executive order. The Act sets forth specific standards the President must use in setting the percentage and detailed procedures to be followed.

The provision that allows the President to set the exact percentage is probably:

(A) Constitutional, because it creates a limited administrative power to implement the statute.

(B) Constitutional, because inherent executive powers permit such action even without statutory authorization.

(C) Unconstitutional as an undue delegation of legislative power to the executive.

(D) Unconstitutional, because it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

\section{Question 33}

The federal government has complete jurisdiction over certain park land located within the state of Plains. To conserve the wildlife that inhabits that land, the federal government enacts a statute forbidding all hunting of animals in the 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

federal park. That statute also forbids the hunting of animals that have left the federal park and have entered the state of Plains.

Hanson has a hunting license from the state of Plains authorizing him to hunt deer anywhere in the state. On land within the state of Plains located adjacent to the federal park, Hanson shoots a deer he knows has recently left the federal land.

Hanson is prosecuted for violating the federal hunting law. The strongest ground supporting the constitutionality of the federal law forbidding the hunting of wild animals that wander off federal property is that:

(A) This law is a necessary and proper means of protecting United States property.

(B) The animals are moving in the stream of interstate commerce.

(C) The police powers of the federal government encompass protection of wild animals.

(D) Shooting wild animals is a privilege, not a right.

\section{Question 34}

A state statute makes fraud for personal financial gain a crime. Jones was convicted of violating this statute on three separate occasions. Following his most recent conviction, he professed to have undergone a religious conversion and proclaimed himself to be the divine minister of "St. Rockport," an alleged messiah who would shortly be making his appearance on earth. Jones solicited cash donations from the public to support his efforts to spread the word of St. Rockport and his coming appearance on earth. Following complaints by several contributors who claimed he defrauded them, Jones was again charged with fraud under this state statute. The charge was that Jones "should have known that his representations about St. Rockport were false and, therefore, that he made them solely to collect cash donations for his personal gain." A witness for the prosecution in Jones's trial stated that Jones had admitted that, at times, he had doubts about the existence of St. Rockport. Jones was the only religious minister prosecuted for fraud under this state statute.

The strongest constitutional defense that Jones could assert would be that this prosecution:

(A) Deprived him of the equal protection of the laws because other religious ministers have not been charged under this statute.

(B) Denied him procedural due process because it placed upon Jones the burden of rebutting evidence, submitted by the state, of his bad faith in raising this money.

(C) Denied him rights conferred by the Obligation of Contracts Clause by preventing him from taking money from persons who wished to contract with him to spread the word of St. Rockport.

(D) Denied him the free exercise of religion in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it required the state to determine the truth or falsity of the content of his religious beliefs. 

\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(C) The statute at issue is void for vagueness. If a criminal law or regulation fails to give persons reasonable notice of what is prohibited, it may violate the Due Process Clause. This principle is applied somewhat strictly when First Amendment activity is involved in order to avoid the chilling effect a vague law might have on speech (i.e., if it is unclear what speech is regulated, people might refrain from speech that is permissible for fear that they will be violating the law). Here, the statute does not give reasonable notice as to what language is being prohibited, and no court decisions have limited its construction. Thus, it is impermissibly vague, and Smith will prevail. Therefore, (A) incorrectly states that Smith will not prevail. (B) is incorrect because it is too broad a statement. First Amendment freedoms are not absolute; for instance, obscenity may be punished under a properly drawn statute. The problem here is that it cannot be determined what speech is being prohibited. (D) is incorrect because there is no constitutional "average person test."

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(D) (D) is the "safest" answer because Congress has the same legislative authority over the District of Columbia as a state legislature has over matters internal to its state. This clearly includes the authority to regulate marriage and divorce. It could be argued that Congress's military and war powers could sustain (A); that Congress's power to regulate the jurisdiction of federal courts could sustain (B); that Congress's power over external affairs, which includes the power to implement executive agreements, could sustain $(\mathrm{C})$, but these arguments are more speculative than that for (D).

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(C) (A) is incorrect because, depending upon specific applications of the proposed legislation, a "taking of property," requiring just compensation, could result. This would raise the issue as to whether the governmental action amounts to a taking (in which case the state must fairly compensate the owner of property) or a regulation (in which case there is no need for compensation), and would certainly be a consideration in the drafting of the subject legislation. (B) is incorrect because the proposed legislation could be seen as constituting a prohibited retroactive impairment of contract rights. (D) is incorrect because questions of "taking" often arise in connection with the state's exercise of its police power (i.e., the power to legislate for the health, welfare, or safety of the people). (C) appears least relevant because the proposed legislation does not seem to contemplate suits against the state.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(B) In order to have standing, a person must usually show a direct and immediate personal injury due to the challenged government action. The claimant must be in a position to demonstrate a concrete stake in the outcome of the suit and a direct impairment of his own constitutional rights. The contractors in (B) satisfy the criteria. The plaintiffs in (C) and (D) do not. As to (A), federal taxpayers generally have no standing to challenge the validity of federal expenditures; in any event, the federal taxpayer here is not complaining of any added tax burdens. State taxpayers may challenge the validity of state programs that involve measurable state expenditures, but here it is a federal program whose constitutionality is in issue and, in any event, the state expenditure is only hypothetical.

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(C) (A) is incorrect because the mere acceptance of federal money to help pay for highways does not amount to a concession of authority over such highways. Federal authority over the highways 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

must be derived from a specific source, rather than from the mere supplying of funds for the highways. Thus, (B) also is incorrect. (D) is incorrect because the constitutionality (or lack thereof) of an exercise of federal legislative power is in no way based on public opinion. (C) is correct because Congress has power to condition federal spending if Congress reasonably finds that the spending program is for the general welfare. Even where Congress otherwise has no power to regulate an area, it can use its spending power to so regulate by requiring entities that accept government money to act in a certain manner.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(D) (D) is correct, because Congress clearly has the right to place conditions on appropriated funds under the spending power and because highways fall within the purview of interstate commerce and are thus subject to Commerce Clause regulation. Few cases have ever declared a generally applicable federal statute based on commerce power to be an unconstitutional interference with state functions, and spending power conditions were upheld in South Dakota $v$. Dole (1987). It follows that (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(B) (B) is an accurate statement of constitutional doctrine. Congress has plenary power over aliens. A state or local law that is based on alienage is subject to strict scrutiny (i.e., a compelling state interest must be shown to justify disparate treatment). When, as with the state law here at issue, state action regulates aliens, Congress's plenary power over aliens arising from its power over naturalization is more directly implicated than Congress's commerce power; thus $(\mathrm{B})$ is a better choice than (A). (C) is incorrect because the state law does not penalize anyone for exercising the right to travel from state to state. (D)'s relevance is remote, at best.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(D) The federal judicial power extends to cases arising under the Constitution of the United States. (D) is correct because the recently enacted state law discriminates against aliens, and many state discriminations against aliens have been held unconstitutional. Thus, there is a federal question. (A) is incorrect because aliens are permitted to bring certain actions in federal court challenging constitutionally suspect governmental action. (B) is incorrect because a state's regulation of land ownership may not be exercised in a manner that runs afoul of constitutional parameters. (C) is incorrect because, even assuming that there is a United Nations charter provision on point, this would not give the court jurisdiction; there must be a federal question.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(C) The court should not hear this suit on the merits because Article III courts are not empowered to hear suits between citizens of the same state where no federal question jurisdiction is involved. Article III lists the cases to which federal jurisdiction extends. It includes suits arising under federal law, and suits between citizens of two or more states. Zall's suit against Motors involves two citizens of the state of Paxico and no federal question is raised. No provision of Article III covers such a suit. Thus, Zall should have brought suit in Paxico state court. (A) is incorrect because the Contracts Clause deals with state legislation impairing contracts and no such legislation is implied by the facts. Article III has no general provision for suits involving the obligation of contracts. (B) is incorrect because while it might be said that the action can affect interstate commerce and thus is subject to federal regulation, absent such federal regulation, there is no basis under Article III for jurisdiction. Article III does not provide for federal court jurisdiction in all cases affecting interstate commerce. (D) is incorrect because a "case or controversy" exists. The case or controversy requirement only prohibits federal courts from rendering advisory opinions, such as where the case is moot or unripe, or the parties are not truly adverse. The parties here are clearly adverse and there is a real, live controversy; the only thing missing is a basis for federal court jurisdiction.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(D) The Fourteenth Amendment prevents states from discriminating against the exercise of "fundamental rights,"' one of which is the right to vote, unless the state shows a compelling interest. The English requirement suggests discrimination against the right to vote of people who cannot speak English. (A) is clearly inapplicable. (B) is clearly incorrect. (C) may be correct, but it is not as good as (D). Note that the Supreme Court has not specifically decided whether a "discriminatory purpose" is required for a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment's bar against governmental racial discrimination in voting.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(C) When a governmental body establishes voting districts for the election of representatives, the number of persons in each district may not vary significantly ("one person, one vote"). This principle applies to almost every election where a person is being elected to perform normal governmental functions. However, the government can limit the class of persons who are allowed to vote in an election of persons to serve on a special purpose government unit if the unit has a special impact on the class of enfranchised voters. The watershed improvement districts referred to in this question are so specialized that election of their directors is not subject to the "one person, one vote" principle. These districts disproportionately affect landowners and do not perform general governmental functions. Thus, (C) is correct. (A) is incorrect because "one person, one vote" has a broader reach than merely election to statewide office. As noted above, the principle applies to almost every election for the performance of normal governmental functions. (B) is incorrect because conditioning the right to vote on property ownership normally would be invalid under the Equal Protection Clause. Only certain special purpose elections can be based on property ownership. (D) incorrectly implies that "one person, one vote" does not apply to states. In fact, the principle is binding on states through the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(B) An act of Congress or federal regulation supersedes any state or local action that actually conflicts with the federal rule, whether by commanding conduct inconsistent with that required by the federal rule, or by forbidding conduct that the federal rule is designed to foster. The conflict need not relate to conduct; it is sufficient if the state law interferes with achievement of a federal objective. In addition, note that Congress has exclusive power over naturalization and denaturalization. Thus, United States treaties and immigration laws would supersede an inconsistent state law, making them relevant to the constitutionality of the state Yuma statute. (A), (C), and (D) all refer to some perceived justification for the statute. However, they are irrelevant because, even if a state law was enacted for a valid purpose, it will be rendered void if it conflicts with federal law.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(A) The acknowledgment that the statute will protect Yuma workers from outside competition is the weakest defense because it indicates that the law has a discriminatory impact. State legislation 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

that is challenged on Commerce Clause grounds (i) must not discriminate against out-of-state competition to benefit local economic interests, and (ii) must not be unduly burdensome. A discriminatory law will be valid only if it furthers an important noneconomic state interest and there are no reasonable alternatives available, whereas a nondiscriminatory law will be valid as long as the legitimate state interests outweigh the burden on interstate commerce. Here, choices (B), (C), and (D) all attempt to provide a nondiscriminatory rationale for the statute, making it easier to pass muster under the Commerce Clause, while choice (A) amounts to a concession by the state that the statute discriminates in favor of state economic interests, making it more likely to be invalidated.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(D) The Supreme Court will hear a case from a state court only if the state court judgment turned on federal grounds. The Court will refuse jurisdiction if it finds adequate and independent nonfederal grounds to support the state decision. The nonfederal grounds must be adequate in that they are fully dispositive of the case, so that even if the federal grounds are wrongly decided, it would not affect the outcome of the case. Also, the nonfederal grounds must be independent. If the state court's interpretation of its state provision was based on federal case law interpreting an identical federal provision, the state law grounds for the decision is not independent. Here, the state supreme court rested its decision on the ground of violation of the state constitution, without any interpretation based on an identical federal provision. Thus, the decision is supported by adequate and independent nonfederal grounds, and the Supreme Court should refuse jurisdiction. (A), (B), and (C) are all based on the incorrect premise that the Supreme Court may somehow properly review the decision.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(D) This issue would not be considered ripe because there is no real harm or immediate threat of harm. If Pine and Ross were actually engaged to be married, refused to undergo the counseling, and then requested that a license be issued, the issue would be ripe, because at that point they would have been denied the license on the basis of the statute. As it is, they have not even come to the point of requesting a license. (A) is wrong because diversity is not the only basis for federal jurisdiction. (B) is wrong because there is a substantial federal question-the right to marry is part of the constitutionally protected right of privacy. (C) is wrong because no political question is presented. Political questions include those issues committed by the Constitution to another branch of government and those inherently incapable of resolution and enforcement by the judicial process.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(C) Where a fundamental right, such as the right to marry, is substantially affected, the state bears the burden of persuading the court that the statute in question is necessary to achieve a compelling or overriding government purpose. (A) is wrong because there is no presumption that state legislators acted properly. Also, as can be seen from the analysis at the beginning of this answer, (A) places the burden on the wrong party. (B) also places the burden on the wrong party. In addition, the Tenth Amendment provides that all powers not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved to the states. The Tenth Amendment does not authorize states to place unconstitutional burdens on fundamental rights. (D) is wrong, because "young adults" are not a discrete and insular class entitled to judicial scrutiny of laws that arguably require equal protection under the law. 

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(C) Whenever Congress acts within the scope of a delegated power such as that of the Commerce Clause, the Supremacy Clause renders any conflicting state or local law or action void. Thus, as applied, the state sprinkler requirement violates the Supremacy Clause. (A) is wrong because a substantive due process claim would be almost guaranteed to fail, since business regulation is now invariably sustained as reasonable state action under the Due Process Clause. (B) is wrong because classifications that relate only to matters of economics or social welfare (not fundamental rights) and do not employ suspect or quasi-suspect classifications are almost always upheld. The classification of building story size is not arbitrary. (D) is wrong because the contract has not been breached, so no Obligation of Contracts Clause issue is presented.

\section{Answer to Question 18}

(B) Race is a "suspect category" under the Equal Protection Clause, but the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to purely private acts of discrimination. However, if state action is found, the clause can be invoked against Country Schoolhouse. State action can be found in the actions of seemingly private individuals who (i) perform exclusive public functions or (ii) have significant state involvement in their activities. (B) states an example of significant state involvement and is, therefore, correct. (A) is wrong because to be state action, the activity must be both a traditional and exclusive government function. Education does not so qualify. The Supreme Court has only found running a town and running an election for public office to be such exclusive government functions. (C) is wrong because the statement is overbroad. Only intentional discrimination will be found to create discriminatory classifications calling for strict scrutiny. (D) is wrong because state involvement must be "significant" to trigger state action. Mere licensure is generally not "significant."

\section{Answer to Question 19}

(D) Prentis's strongest argument would be that his Fifth Amendment due process rights have been abridged. While the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to state action, it is clear that arbitrary or invidious discrimination by the federal government violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Thus, there are really two equal protection guarantees. Since age is not a suspect category, this legislation would only be subject to the rational basis test. Because other civil service employees can work until the age of 75 , Prentis would have an argument that the state had invidiously discriminated against him on the basis of age. His argument would probably fail, but is the "strongest" argument of the four alternatives given. (A) is wrong because employment is not a privilege or immunity of national citizenship. (B) is wrong because, where a public employee holds his position at the will of an employer, there is no property interest in continued employment. Since Prentis was dismissed on the basis of his age, rather than for cause, he had no property interest in continued employment. (C) is wrong because under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress may do anything that is arguably appropriate to relate to a federal interest.

\section{Answer to Question 20}

(D) This would be the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of this statute. Article I, Section 8, Paragraph 3 empowers Congress to "regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes." Only rarely has a modern case invalidated a federal law regulating nongovernmental persons because it exceeded the commerce power. (A) is wrong because Congress does not have a general welfare power to regulate all activity in this 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

country. (B) is wrong because it would not justify the statute at issue. (C) is wrong because it overstates congressional power by failing to connect the activity to "commerce."

\section{Answer to Question 21}

(B) Congress has the power to regulate and limit the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Thus, the statute here, which was enacted by Congress, properly authorizes direct appeal of a specified decision to the Supreme Court. (A) is incorrect because there is nothing to support the proposition that Congress has plenary control over matters involving energy use. Also, (A) does not address the issue of jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. (C) is incorrect because states possess no such sovereign right. Federal review of state acts (whether they be executive, legislative, or judicial) is well established. (D) is incorrect because Article III actually provides that the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction under such regulations as Congress shall make.

\section{Answer to Question 22}

(A) Application (A) is the most clearly constitutional. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal protection; it applies directly only to "state action," which is most clearly indicated in answer (A). Thus, answers (B) and (C) are not as clearly constitutional. Answer (D) is incorrect because the Fourteenth Amendment does not directly apply to federal action. Congress's power to prohibit federal acts would be easier to justify under Article I (e.g., as necessary and proper to carry out the spending power). Thus, (D) is not as clear a Fourteenth Amendment case as (A).

\section{Answer to Question 23}

(C) Race is a suspect classification under the Equal Protection Clause. However, the Fourteenth Amendment only applies if there is action by a state or local government office, or a private individual whose behavior meets the requirement of "state action." State action exists where seemingly private individuals (i) perform exclusive public functions, or (ii) have significant state involvement in their activities. "State action" also exists where a state affirmatively facilitates, encourages, or authorizes acts of discrimination by its citizens. However, there must be some sort of affirmative act by the state approving the private action. It is not enough that the state merely permits the conduct to occur. Under these facts, several state officials serve on the Bar Association's Board of Bar Governors. Furthermore, the state supreme court requires all lawyers to be members of the State Bar Association. Thus, the State Bar Association does not operate independently of the state and, therefore, Plaintiffs' strongest argument would be to demonstrate that "state action" is involved in payment of dues by the Association to private clubs that discriminate. Thus, (C) is correct. (A) is wrong because "state action" is required to invoke the antidiscrimination protections of the Fourteenth Amendment. Only the Thirteenth Amendment's ban on badges or incidents of slavery applies to purely private actions. (B) is wrong because the failure of the Association to pass a resolution forbidding discrimination does not, in and of itself, constitute a denial of equal protection, and the argument for state action being present is much weaker than in option (C). (D) is wrong because, unless it is shown that the Association is an instrumentality of the state or closely intertwined with state action, the mere fact of its payment of dues to such private clubs will not invoke the Equal Protection Clause. (C) is the only answer that clearly focuses on the state action issue.

\section{Answer to Question 24}

(A) The court should hear the case on the merits. Federal judicial power extends to all cases and controversies arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. Because the activities of the State Bar Association present a federal claim arising under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, the federal district court should hear the case on its merits. Therefore, (A) is correct. (B) is wrong because it is the Fourteenth Amendment that applies to the states. The Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause forbids federal discrimination. (C) is wrong because the doctrine of abstention is applicable when a federal constitutional claim is premised on an unsettled question of state law. These facts present no such unsettled state law question. (D) is wrong because the Bar Association's activities encroach on federally protected constitutional rights and, therefore, are not solely within the domain of state law, nor are there any "adequate and independent state grounds" here.

\section{Answer to Question 25}

(C) (C) is correct because the Thirteenth Amendment addresses private acts of racial discrimination. (D) is incorrect because the Supreme Court has not recognized any power of Congress to regulate private persons under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. (A) is incorrect because the Obligation of Contracts Clause prohibits states from impairing contractual obligations. Thus, this clause is inapplicable to this case. (B) is incorrect because the General Welfare Clause authorizes Congress to spend to provide for the common defense and general welfare. There is no connection between this clause and the statute at issue.

\section{Answer to Question 26}

(A) Congress has the power to declare war, raise and support armies, provide for and maintain a navy, and spend to provide for the common defense and general welfare, as well as the power to make all laws that are necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers or any other federal power (including the power of the President and Senate to enter into treaties in conformity with Article II). Pursuant to these enumerated powers, Congress can take preventive measures against activities that may cause international misunderstandings, which in turn may lead to war, as well as against endeavors to undermine the government. The statute here shows a congressional intent to ensure that only properly authorized persons negotiate with foreign governments, and it is a legitimate means of implementing Congress's powers. (B) is incorrect because, although the President has broad discretion in foreign affairs, it is doubtful that such discretion would include the authority to unilaterally punish citizens who encroach on that discretion, absent legislative authorization to impose such punishment. (C) and (D) are incorrect because they are based on the mistaken notion that laws dealing with foreign affairs need not pass constitutional muster.

\section{Answer to Question 27}

(C) A challenge based on interstate commerce would be most effective. Sometimes a nondiscriminatory law that regulates commerce may place a burden on interstate commerce. Such a law will be invalidated if the burden on interstate commerce outweighs local interests. This is a case-by-case balancing test, and it is by no means clear that the law in question would be ruled invalid. However, the Commerce Clause issue is the only answer where there is any reasonable likelihood that the legislation could be declared invalid. Thus, (C) is the correct answer. (A) is wrong because no fundamental right is involved and, therefore, the mere rationality test is applied, and the law will be upheld if it is rationally related to any conceivable legitimate end of government. The seat belt law clearly meets this minimal standard and any challenge based on due process would surely fail. (B) is wrong because the legislation does not involve a fundamental right, a suspect classification, or a quasi-suspect classification. In equal protection analysis, if any other classification is involved, the action will be upheld unless the challenger proves that the action is not rationally 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

related to a legitimate government interest. Transport Lines cannot carry such a burden of proof. (D) is wrong because a constitutional challenge should be based on the infringement of rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Difficulty of enforcement is not relevant here.

\section{Answer to Question 28}

(B) Congress may regulate any activity, local or interstate, which either in itself, or in combination with other activities, has a substantial effect upon interstate commerce. Here, although most stolen bicycles remain within the state in which they were stolen, the cumulative effect of many instances of stolen bicycles being transported across state lines for resale could be felt in interstate commerce. It follows that (C) is incorrect. (A) is incorrect because Congress has the power to spend for the general welfare. The property power involves the disposal and acquisition of property belonging to the United States, and is not at all relevant to this question. (D) is incorrect because the Tenth Amendment reserves to the states those powers not delegated to the United States nor prohibited to the states by the Constitution. As noted above, the power to regulate commerce is conferred upon Congress by the Constitution. Thus, this matter is not reserved to the states.

\section{Answer to Question 29}

(B) The purchase of contraceptives is encompassed by the fundamental right of privacy. Because this statute contains no procedural safeguards, it denies minors a fundamental right without due process. Because Drugs, Inc., may assert the minors' rights, (B) is the correct answer. (A) is incorrect because there does not appear to be an undue burden on interstate commerce. (C) is incorrect because the statute does not treat state residents differently from out-of-state residents. (D) is nonsensical. Note: Under the Supreme Court's decisions regarding the sale of contraceptives to minors, the best possible answer would have been that the statute violated equal protection because it denied a fundamental right to a class of persons (minors) without sufficient justification. Since that answer was not given, the due process answer (which mentioned fundamental rights) was the best choice.

\section{Answer to Question 30}

(D) It has been held that the Property Clause empowers Congress to protect wildlife wandering onto federally owned lands. (B) is incorrect because the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV pertains to discrimination by states against out-of-state citizens. (A) is incorrect because the commerce power is not as easy a way to justify the law as is the property power, which clearly and literally applies here (note the wording of the question). (C) is incorrect because the enabling clause of the Fourteenth Amendment gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment by appropriate legislation. The Fourteenth Amendment, which prevents the states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law and equal protection of the law, is not at issue here.

\section{Answer to Question 31}

(C) A federal court will not decide political questions, which are: (i) those issues committed by the Constitution to another branch of government; and (ii) those issues inherently incapable of resolution and enforcement by the judicial process. Political questions include those regarding the conduct of foreign relations. Based on Supreme Court cases, the recognition of and establishment of diplomatic relations with a foreign country appear to be political questions. Thus, (D) is incorrect. (A) and (B) are incorrect because Dunn will be injured economically by the actions of the President and Secretary of State. Therefore, Dunn can demonstrate such a concrete stake in the outcome of this controversy as to ensure the adversariness which sharpens the presentation of issues.

\section{Answer to Question 32}

(A) Legislative power can be delegated to executive officers and/or administrative agencies. Any delegated power must not be uniquely confined to Congress. The delegation must include intelligible standards for action by the delegatee. The statutory provision here meets these criteria for a permissible delegation. It follows that (C) is incorrect. (B) is an incorrect statement of law. Even if the executive had the inherent power, that would not make the legislation constitutional. (D) is incorrect because this statute does not represent arbitrary governmental action. It serves a proper governmental purpose and provides for specific standards and procedures relative to its implementation.

\section{Answer to Question 33}

(A) In addition to its enumerated powers, Congress possesses auxiliary powers that are necessary and proper to carrying out all powers vested in the federal government. The statute here at issue is necessary and proper to carry out Congress's property power. By proscribing even the hunting of animals that have left the federal park, the statute will help protect the wildlife, which is property belonging to the United States. (B) is not the "strongest ground" because nothing in the facts points to interstate commerce. $(\mathrm{C})$ is incorrect because the police power is a power of state government, not the federal government. (D), as a general statement of law, is incorrect. Also, it apparently is based on the rejected "right" vs. "privilege" distinction relative to deprivation of liberty and property without procedural due process, an issue not raised by these facts.

\section{Answer to Question 34}

(D) Jones's strongest defense is that the statute violates his free exercise of religion. The Free Exercise Clause forbids government from making laws that prohibit the free exercise of religion. The Court has held that this means that the government may not punish a person for his or her religious beliefs. In determining what is a religious belief, the court may delve into the sincerity of the belief, but it may not find religious beliefs to be false. Thus, the prosecution here may be unconstitutional because it was based on the alleged falsity of a religious belief. (A) could be correct but it is not as good a basis as (D). Under the Equal Protection Clause, government must not unreasonably discriminate against similarly situated people. If a law discriminates (on its face or in its application) on the basis of a suspect class or where a fundamental right is involved, the law will be held invalid unless it is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest. Here, the law interferes with freedom of religion (a fundamental right), but it is not clear from this one prosecution that the law is being applied in a discriminatory manner. Therefore, (D) is a better answer. (B) is incorrect because the Due Process Clause requires only that the prosecution prove each element of a crime. Once the prosecution proves an element, there is no due process violation in having the defendant rebut the evidence; otherwise no one could ever be convicted of a crime. (C) is wrong because it is not clear that there was a Contract Clause violation. The Contract Clause forbids the retroactive impairment of contract rights unless the impairment is narrowly tailored to meet an important government interest. Here, the statute was apparently in existence when Jones "contracted" with his donors (although presumably the donations were gratuitous and not contractual). Thus, there is no retroactive impairment of contract. Moreover, 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

even if this were a retroactive impairment, it could be argued that it was justified because preventing fraud is an important government interest. In any case, this clearly is not as good a defense as (D). 

\section{CONTRACTS QUESTIONS}

Questions 1-2 are based on the following fact situation:

Addie, who has been in the painting and contracting business for 10 years and has a fine reputation, contracts to paint Boone's barn. Boone's barn is a standard red barn with a loft. The contract has no provision regarding assignment.

1. If Addie assigns the contract to Coot, who has comparable experience and reputation, which of the following statements is correct?
(A) Addie is in breach of contract.
(B) Boone may refuse to accept perfor- mance by Coot.
(C) Boone is required to accept perfor- mance by Coot.
(D) There is a novation.

2. If Addie assigns the contract to Coot and thereafter Coot does not meet the contract specifications in painting Boone's barn, Boone:
(A) Has a cause of action against Addie for damages.
(B) Has a cause of action only against Coot for damages.
(C) Has a cause of action against Addie for damages, only after he has first exhausted his remedies against Coot.
(D) Does not have a cause of action against Addie for damages because he waived his rights against Addie by permitting Coot to perform the work.

Questions 3-5 are based on the following fact situation:

Johnston purchased 100 bolts of standard blue wool, No. 1 quality, from McHugh. The sales contract provided that Johnston would make payment prior to inspection. The 100 bolts were shipped and Johnston paid McHugh. Upon inspection, however, Johnston discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality. Johnston thereupon tendered back the wool to McHugh and demanded return of his payment. McHugh refused on the ground that there is no difference between No. 1 quality wool and No. 2 quality wool.

3. Which of the following statements regarding the contract provision for preinspection payment is correct?
(A) It constitutes an acceptance of the goods.
(B) It constitutes a waiver of the buyer's remedy of private sale in the case of nonconforming goods.
(C) It does not impair a buyer's right of inspection or his remedies.
(D) It is invalid.

4. What is Johnston's remedy because the wool was nonconforming?

(A) Specific performance.

(B) Damages measured by the difference between the value of the goods delivered and the value of conforming goods.

(C) Damages measured by the price paid plus the difference between the contract price and the cost of buying substitute goods.

(D) None, since he waived his remedies by agreeing to pay before inspection.

5. Can Johnston resell the wool?
(A) Yes, in a private sale.
(B) Yes, in a private sale but only after giving McHugh reasonable notice of his intention to resell. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

(C) Yes, but only at a public sale.

(D) No.

Questions 6-8 are based on the following fact situation:

Duffer and Slicker, who lived in different suburbs 20 miles apart, were golfing acquaintances at the Interurban Country Club. Both were traveling salesmen-Duffer for a pharmaceutical house and Slicker for a widget manufacturer. Duffer wrote Slicker by United States mail on Friday, October 8:

I need a motorcycle for transportation to the country club, and will buy your Sujocki for $\$ 1,200$ upon your bringing it to my home address above [stated in the letterhead] on or before noon, November 12 next. This offer is not subject to countermand.

Sincerely,

[signed] Duffer

Slicker replied by mail the following day:

I accept your offer and promise to deliver the bike as you specified.

Sincerely,

[signed] Slicker

This letter, although properly addressed, was misdirected by the postal service and not received by Duffer until November 10 . Duffer had bought another Sujocki bike from Koolcat for $\$ 1,050$ a few hours before.

Koolcat saw Slicker at the Interurban Country Club on November 11 and said: "I sold my Sujocki to Duffer yesterday for $\$ 1,050$. Would you consider selling me yours for $\$ 950$ ?" Slicker replied, "I'll let you know in a few days."

On November 12, Slicker took his Sujocki to Duffer's residence; he arrived at 11:55 a.m. Duffer was asleep and did not answer Slicker's doorbell rings until $12: 15 \mathrm{p}$.m. Duffer then rejected Slicker's bike on the ground that he had already bought Koolcat's.

6. In Duffer's letter of October 8, what was the legal effect of the language: "This offer is not subject to countermand"?

(A) Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the offer was irrevocable until noon, November 12.

(B) Such language prevented an effective acceptance by Slicker prior to noon, November 12.

(C) At common law, such language created a binding option in Slicker's favor.

(D) Such language did not affect the offeror's power of revocation of the offer.

7. In a lawsuit by Slicker against Duffer for breach of contract, what would the court probably decide regarding Slicker's letter of October 9?

(A) The letter bound both parties to a unilateral contract as soon as Slicker mailed it.

(B) Mailing of the letter by Slicker did not, of itself, prevent a subsequent effective revocation by Duffer of his offer.

(C) The letter bound both parties to a bilateral contract, but only when received by Duffer on November 10.

(D) Regardless of whether Duffer's offer had proposed a unilateral or a bilateral contract, the letter was an effective acceptance upon receipt, if not upon dispatch.

8. What is the probable legal effect of Koolcat's conversation with Slicker and report that he (Koolcat) had sold his Sujocki to Duffer on November 10 ?

(A) This report had no legal effect because Duffer's offer was irrevocable until November 12.

(B) Unless a contract had already been formed between Slicker and Duffer, Koolcat's report to Slicker operated to terminate Slicker's power of accepting Duffer's offer.

(C) This report had no legal effect because the offer had been made by a prospective buyer (Duffer) rather than a prospective seller.

(D) Koolcat's conversation with Slicker on November 11 terminated Duffer's original offer and operated as an offer by Koolcat to buy Slicker's Sujocki for $\$ 950$.

Questions 9-10 are based on the following fact situation:

Tortfeasor tortiously injured Victim in an auto accident. While Victim was recovering in Hospital, Tortfeasor's liability insurer, Insurer, settled with Victim for $\$ 5,000$. Victim gave Insurer a signed release and received a signed memorandum wherein Insurer promised to pay Victim $\$ 5,000$ by check within 30 days. When Victim left Hospital two days later, Hospital demanded payment of its $\$ 4,000$ stated bill. Victim thereupon gave Hospital his own negotiable promissory note for $\$ 4,000$, payable to Hospital's order in 30 days, and also, as security, assigned to Hospital the Insurer settlement memorandum. Hospital promptly assigned for value the settlement memorandum and negotiated the note to Holder, who took the note as a holder in due course. Subsequently, Victim misrepresented to Insurer that he had lost the settlement memorandum and needed another. Insurer issued another memorandum identical to the first, and Victim assigned it to $\mathrm{ABC}$ Furniture to secure a $\$ 5,000$ credit sale contract. $\mathrm{ABC}$ immediately notified Insurer of this assignment. Later it was discovered that Hospital had mistakenly overbilled Victim by the amount of $\$ 1,000$ and that Tortfeasor was an irresponsible minor.

9. If Victim starts an action against Insurer 40 days after the insurance settlement agreement, can Victim recover?

(A) Yes, because his attempted assignments of his claim against Insurer were ineffective, inasmuch as Insurer's promise to pay "by check" created a right in Victim that was too personal to assign.

(B) No, because he no longer has possession of Insurer's written memorandum.

(C) No, because Tortfeasor's minority and irresponsibility vitiated the settlement agreement between Victim and Insurer.

(D) No, because he has made at least one effective assignment of his claim against Insurer, and Insurer has notice thereof.

10. In view of Tortfeasor's age and irresponsibility when Insurer issued his liability policy, can Holder and $\mathrm{ABC}$ Furniture recover on their assignments?

(A) Neither can recover because Victim, the assignor, is a third-party beneficiary of the liability policy, whose rights thereon can be no better than Tortfeasor's.

(B) Neither can recover unless Insurer knowingly waived the defense of Tortfeasor's minority and irresponsibility.

(C) Neither can recover because the liability policy, and settlement thereunder, are unenforceable because of Tortfeasor's minority.

(D) Either Holder or ABC Furniture, depending on priority, can recover as 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

assignee (or subassignee) of Victim's claim because the latter arose from Insurer's settlement agreement, the latter agreement not being vitiated by Tortfeasor's minority and irresponsibility when he obtained the policy.

\section{Question 11}

On January 15, Carpenter agreed to repair Householder's house according to certain specifications and to have the work completed by April 1. On March 1, Householder's property was inundated by flood waters which did not abate until March 15. Householder could not get the house in a condition which would permit Carpenter to begin the repairs until March 31 . On that date Carpenter notified Householder that he would not repair the house.

Which one of the following facts, if it was the only one true and known to both parties on January 15, would best serve Carpenter as the basis for a defense in an action brought against him by Householder for breach of contract?

(A) Carpenter's busy schedule permitted him to work on Householder's house only during the month of March.

(B) Any delay in making the repairs would not seriously affect Householder's use of the property.

(C) The cost of making repairs was increasing at the rate of $3 \%$ a month.

(D) The area around Householder's property was frequently flooded during the month of March.

\section{Question 12}

In a telephone call on March 1, Adams, an unemployed, retired person, said to Dawes, "I will sell my automobile for $\$ 3,000$ cash. I will hold this offer open through March 14." On March 12, Adams called Dawes and told her that he had sold the automobile to Clark. Adams in fact had not sold the automobile to anyone. On March 14, Dawes learned that Adams still owned the automobile, and on that date called Adams and said, "I' $\mathrm{m}$ coming over to your place with $\$ 3,000$." Adams replied, "Don't bother. I won' $t$ deliver the automobile to you under any circumstances." Dawes protested, but made no further attempt to pay for or take delivery of the automobile.

In an action by Dawes against Adams for breach of contract, Dawes probably will:

(A) Succeed, because Adams had assured her that the offer would remain open through March 14.

(B) Succeed, because Adams had not in fact sold the automobile to Clark.

(C) Not succeed, because Dawes had not tendered the $\$ 3,000$ to Adams on or before March 14.

(D) Not succeed, because on March 12, Adams had told Dawes that he had sold the automobile to Clark.

\section{Question 13}

Carver is a chemical engineer. She has no interest in or connection with Chemco. Carver noticed that Chemco's most recent publicly issued financial statement listed, as part of Chemco's assets, a large inventory of a certain special chemical compound. This asset was listed at a cost of $\$ 100,000$, but Carver knew that the ingredients of the compound were in short supply and that the current market value of the inventory was in excess of $\$ 1$ million. There was no current public quotation of the price of Chemco stock. The book value of Chemco stock, according to the statement, was $\$ 5$ per share; its actual value was $\$ 30$ per share.

Knowing these facts, Carver offered to purchase from Page at $\$ 6$ per share the 1,000 shares of Chemco stock owned by Page. Page and Carver had not previously met. Page sold the stock to Carver for $\$ 6$ per share.

If Page asserts a claim based on misrepresentation against Carver, will Page prevail? (A) Yes, because Carver knew that the value of the stock was greater than the price she offered.

(B) Yes, if Carver did not inform Page of the true value of the inventory.

(C) No, unless Carver told Page that the stock was not worth more than $\$ 6$ per share.

(D) No, if Chemco's financial statement was available to Page.

Questions 14-15 are based on the following fact situation:

In a written contract Singer agreed to deliver to Byer 500 described chairs at $\$ 20$ each F.O.B. Singer's place of business. The contract provided that "neither party will assign this contract without the written consent of the other." Singer placed the chairs on board a carrier on January 30. On February 1, Singer said in a signed writing, "I hereby assign to Wheeler all my rights under the Singer-Byer contract." Singer did not request and did not get Byer's consent to this transaction. On February 2, the chairs, while in transit, were destroyed in a derailment of the carrier's railroad car.

14. In an action by Wheeler against Byer, Wheeler probably will recover:
(A) $\$ 10,000$, the contract price.
(B) The difference between the contract price and the market value of the chairs.
(C) Nothing, because the chairs had not been delivered.
(D) Nothing, because the Singer-Byer contract forbade an assignment.

15. In an action by Byer against Singer for breach of contract, Byer probably will:

(A) Succeed, because the carrier will be deemed to be Singer's agent. (B) Succeed, because the risk of loss was on Singer.

(C) Not succeed, because of impossibility of performance.

(D) Not succeed, because the risk of loss was on Byer.

\section{Question 16}

After several days of negotiations, Ohner wrote to Plummer: "Will pay you $\$ 3,000$ if you will install new plumbing in my office building according to the specifications I have sent you. I must have your reply by March 30 ." Plummer replied by a letter that Ohner received on March 15: "Will not do it for less than $\$ 3,500$." On March 20, Plummer wrote to Ohner: "Have changed my mind. I will do the work for $\$ 3,000$. Unless I hear from you to the contrary, I will begin work on April 5." Ohner received this letter on March 22 but did not reply to it. Plummer, without Ohner's knowledge, began the work on April 5.

Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship between Ohner and Plummer as of April 5?

(A) A contract was formed on March 20 when Plummer posted his letter.

(B) A contract was formed on March 22 when Ohner received Plummer's letter.

(C) A contract was formed on April 5 when Plummer began work.

(D) There was no contract between the parties as of April 5.

Questions 17-18 are based on the following fact situation:

On January 15 , in a signed writing, Artisan agreed to remodel Ohner's building according to certain specifications, Ohner to pay the agreed price of $\$ 5,000$ to Artisan's niece, Roberta Neese, as a birthday present. Neese did not learn of the agreement until her birthday on May 5. Before they signed the writing, Artisan and Ohner had orally agreed that their "written agreement will be null and void unless Ohner is able to obtain a $\$ 5,000$ loan from the First National Bank before January 31."

17. For this question only, assume that Ohner was unable to obtain the loan and, on January 31, phoned Artisan and told him, "Don't begin the work. The deal is off." In an action for breach of contract brought against Ohner by the proper party, will Ohner be successful in asserting as a defense his inability to obtain a loan?

(A) Yes, because obtaining a loan was a condition precedent to the existence of an enforceable contract.

(B) Yes, because the agreement about obtaining a loan is a modification of a construction contract and is not required to be in writing.

(C) No, because the agreement about obtaining a loan contradicts the express and implied terms of the writing.

(D) No, because Ohner is estopped to deny the validity of the written agreement.

18. For this question only, assume that Ohner obtained the loan, that Artisan completed the remodeling on May 1, and that on May 3 , at Artisan's request, Ohner paid the $\$ 5,000$ to Artisan. If Neese learns of Ohner's payment to Artisan on May 5, at the same time she learns of the written Artisan-Ohner contract, will she succeed in an action against Ohner for $\$ 5,000$ ?

(A) Yes, because she is an intended beneficiary of the written Artisan-Ohner contract.

(B) Yes, because the written Artisan-Ohner contract operated as an assignment to Neese, and Artisan thereby lost whatever rights he may have had to the $\$ 5,000$. (C) No, because Neese had not furnished any consideration to support Ohner's promise to pay $\$ 5,000$ to her.

(D) No, because on May 3, Artisan and Ohner effectively modified their written contract, thereby depriving Neese of whatever rights she may have had under that contract.

Questions 19-20 are based on the following fact situation:

When Esther, Gray's 21-year-old daughter, finished college, Gray handed her a signed memorandum stating that if she would go to law school for three academic years, he would pay her tuition, room, and board, and would "give her a $\$ 1,000$ bonus" for each "A" she got in law school. Esther's uncle, Miller, who was present on this occasion, read the memorandum and thereupon said to Esther, "and if he doesn't pay your expenses, I will." Gray paid her tuition, room, and board for her first year but died just before the end of that year. Subsequently, Esther learned that she had received two "As" in the second semester. The executor of Gray's estate has refused to pay her anything for the two "As" and has told her that the estate will no longer pay her tuition, room, and board in law school.

19. In an action by Esther against Miller on account of the executor's repudiation of Gray's promise to pay future tuition, room, and board, which of the following would be Miller's strongest defense?
(A) The parties did not manifestly intend a contract.
(B) Gray's death terminated the agree- ment.
(C) The agreement was oral.
(D) The agreement was divisible.

20. In an action against Gray's estate for $\$ 2,000$ on account of the two "As," if the only defense raised is lack of consideration, Esther probably will: (A) Succeed under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.

(B) Succeed on a theory of bargained-for exchange for her father's promise.

(C) Not succeed, because the $\$ 1,000$ for each "A" was promised only as a bonus.

(D) Not succeed, because Esther was already legally obligated to use her best efforts in law school.

\section{Question 21}

Zeller contracted in writing to deliver to Baker 100 bushels of wheat on August 1 at $\$ 3.50$ per bushel. Because his suppliers had not delivered enough wheat to him by that time, Zeller on August 1 had only 95 bushels of wheat with which to fulfill his contract with Baker.

If Zeller tenders 95 bushels of wheat to Baker on August 1, and Baker refuses to accept or pay for any of the wheat, which of the following best states the legal relationship between Zeller and Baker?

(A) Zeller has a cause of action against Baker, because Zeller has substantially performed his contract.

(B) Zeller is excused from performing his contract because of impossibility of performance.

(C) Baker has a cause of action against Zeller for Zeller's failure to deliver 100 bushels of wheat.

(D) Baker is obligated to give Zeller a reasonable time to attempt to obtain the other five bushels of wheat.

Questions 22-23 are based on the following fact situation:

On May 1, Selco and Byco entered into a written agreement in which Selco agreed to fabricate and sell to Byco 10,000 specially designed brake linings for a new type of power brake manufactured by Byco. The contract provided that Byco would pay half of the purchase price on May 15 in order to give Selco funds to "tool up" for the work; that Selco would deliver 5,000 brake linings on May 31; that Byco would pay the balance of the purchase price on June 5; and that Selco would deliver the balance of the brake linings on June 30 .

On May 10, Selco notified Byco that it was doubtful whether Selco could perform because of problems encountered in modifying its production machines to produce the brake linings. On May 15, however, Selco assured Byco that the production difficulties had been overcome, and Byco paid Selco the first $50 \%$ installment of the purchase price. Selco did not deliver the first 5,000 brake linings on May 31 , or at any time thereafter; and on June 10, Selco notified Byco that it would not perform the contract.

22. Which of the following correctly states Byco's rights and obligations immediately after receipt of Selco's notice on May 10?

(A) Byco can treat the notice as an anticipatory repudiation, and has a cause of action on May 10 for breach of the entire contract.

(B) Byco can treat the notice as an anticipatory repudiation, and can sue at once to enjoin an actual breach by Selco on May 31.

(C) Byco has no cause of action for breach of contract, but can suspend its performance and demand assurances that Selco will perform.

(D) Byco has no cause of action for breach of contract, and must pay the installment of the purchase price due on May 15 to preserve its rights under the contract.

23. Which of the following is not a correct statement of the parties' legal status 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

immediately after Selco's notice on June 10 ?

(A) Byco has a cause of action for total breach of contract because of Selco's repudiation, but that cause of action will be lost if Selco retracts its repudiation before Byco changes its position or manifests to Selco that Byco considers the repudiation final.

(B) Byco can bring suit to rescind the contract even if it elects to await Selco's performance for a commercially reasonable time.

(C) Byco can await performance by Selco for a commercially reasonable time, but if Byco awaits performance beyond that period, it cannot recover any resulting damages that it reasonably could have avoided.

(D) Byco has a cause of action for breach of contract that it can successfully assert only after it has given Selco a commercially reasonable time to perform.

Questions 24-25 are based on the following fact situation:

The Kernel Corporation, through its president, Demeter Gritz, requested from Vault Finance, Inc., a short-term loan of $\$ 100,000$. On April 1, Gritz and Vault's loan officer agreed orally that Vault would make the loan on the following terms: (1) the loan would be repaid in full on or before the following July 1 and would carry interest at an annual rate of 15\% (a lawful rate under the applicable usury law); and (2) Gritz would personally guarantee repayment. The loan was approved and made on April 5. The only document evidencing the loan was a memorandum, written and supplied by Vault and signed by Gritz for Kernel, that read in its entirety:

\section{April 5}

In consideration of a loan advanced on this date, Kernel Corporation hereby promises to pay Vault Finance, Inc., $\$ 100,000$ on September 1.

Kernel Corporation
by /s/ Demeter Gritz
Demeter Gritz, President

Kernel Corporation did not repay the loan on or before July 1, although it had sufficient funds to do so. On July 10, Vault sued Kernel as principal debtor and Gritz individually as guarantor for $\$ 100,000$, plus $15 \%$ interest from April 5.

24. At the trial, can Vault prove Kernel's oral commitment to repay the loan on or before July 1 ?

(A) Yes, because the oral agreement was supported by an independent consideration.

(B) Yes, because evidence of the parties' negotiations is relevant to their contractual intent concerning maturity of the debt.

(C) No, because such evidence is barred by the preexisting duty rule.

(D) No, because such evidence contradicts the writing and is barred by the parol evidence rule.

25. At the trial, can Vault prove Gritz's oral promise to guarantee the loan?

(A) Yes, because Gritz signed the memorandum.

(B) Yes, because, as president of the debtor-company, Gritz is a third-party beneficiary of the loan.

(C) No, because there was no separate consideration for Gritz's promise.

(D) No, because such proof is barred by the Statute of Frauds. 

\section{Question 26}

Osif owned Broadacres in fee simple. For a consideration of $\$ 5,000$, Osif gave Bard a written option to purchase Broadacres for $\$ 300,000$. The option was assignable. For a consideration of $\$ 10,000$, Bard subsequently gave an option to Cutter to purchase Broadacres for $\$ 325,000$. Cutter exercised his option.

Bard thereupon exercised his option. Bard paid the agreed price of $\$ 300,000$, and took title to Broadacres by deed from Osif. Thereafter, Cutter refused to consummate his purchase.

Bard brought an appropriate action against Cutter for specific performance, or, if that should be denied, then for damages. Cutter counterclaimed for return of the $\$ 10,000$.

In this action, the court will:
(A) Grant money damages only to Bard.
(B) Grant specific performance to Bard.
(C) Grant Bard only the right to retain the $\$ 10,000$.
(D) Require Bard to refund the $\$ 10,000$ to Cutter.

Questions 27-28 are based on the following fact situation:

Mater, a wealthy widow, wishing to make a substantial and potentially enduring gift to her beloved adult stepson, Prodigal, established with the Vault Savings and Loan Association a passbook savings account by an initial deposit of $\$ 10,000$.

27. For this question only, assume the following facts. The passbook was issued solely in Prodigal's name; but Mater retained possession of it, and Prodigal was not then informed of the savings account. Subsequently, Mater became disgusted with Prodigal's behavior and decided to give the same savings account solely to her beloved adult daughter Distaff. As permitted by the rules of Vault Savings and Loan, Mater effected this change by agreement with Vault. This time she left possession of the passbook with Vault. Shortly thereafter, Prodigal learned of the original savings account in his name and the subsequent switch to Distaff's name.

If Prodigal now sues Vault Savings and Loan for $\$ 10,000$ plus accrued interest, will the action succeed?
(A) Yes, because Prodigal was a third- party intended beneficiary of the original Mater-Vault deposit agree- ment.
(B) Yes, because Prodigal was a construc- tive assignee of Mater's claim, as depositor, to the savings account.
(C) No, because Prodigal never obtained possession of the passbook.
(D) No, because Prodigal's right, if any, to the funds on deposit was effectively abrogated by the second Mater-Vault deposit agreement.

28. For this question only, assume the following facts. The passbook was issued by Vault to Mater solely in her own name. That same day, disinterested witnesses being present, she handed the passbook to Prodigal and said, "As a token of my love and affection for you, I give you this $\$ 10,000$ savings account." Shortly thereafter, she changed her mind and wrote Prodigal, "I hereby revoke my gift to you of the $\$ 10,000$ savings account with Vault Savings and Loan Association. Please return my passbook immediately. Signed: Mater." Prodigal received this letter but ignored it, and Mater died unexpectedly a few days later.

In litigation between Prodigal and Mater's estate, which of the following is a correct statement of the parties' rights with respect to the money on deposit with Vault? (A) The estate prevails, because Mater's gift to Prodigal was revocable and was terminated by her death.

(B) The estate prevails, because Mater's gift to Prodigal was revocable and was terminated by her express revocation.

(C) Prodigal prevails, because he took Mater's claim to the savings account by a gratuitous but effective and irrevocable assignment from Mater.

(D) Prodigal prevails, because his failure to reject the gift, even if the assignment was revocable, created an estoppel against Mater and her estate.

Questions 29-30 are based on the following fact situation:

On October 1, Toy Store, Inc., entered into a written contract with Fido Factory, Inc., for the purchase at $\$ 20$ per unit of 1,000 mechanical dogs, to be specially manufactured by Fido according to Toy Store's specifications. Fido promised to deliver all of the dogs "not later than November 15, for the Yule shopping season,"' and Toy Store promised to pay the full $\$ 20,000$ price upon delivery. In order to obtain operating funds, Fido as borrower entered into a written loan agreement on October 5 with the High Finance Company. In relevant part, this agreement recited, "Fido Factory hereby transfers and assigns to High Finance its (Fido Factory's) October 1 mechanical dog contract with Toy Store, as security for a 50 -day loan of $\$ 15,000$, the advance and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged by Fido Factory. ..." No copy of this agreement, or statement relating to it, was filed in an office of public record.

On October 15, Fido notified Toy Store, "We regret to advise that our master shaft burned out last night because our night supervisor let the lubricant level get too low. We have just fired the supervisor, but the shaft cannot be repaired or replaced until about January 1. We can guarantee delivery of your order, however, not later than January 20." Toy Store rejected this proposal as unacceptable and immediately contracted with the only other available manufacturer to obtain the 1,000 dogs at $\$ 30$ per unit by November 15 .

29. For this question only, assume that on November 1, Toy Store sues Fido for damages and alleges the above facts, except those relating to the Fido-High Finance loan agreement. Upon Fido's motion to dismiss the complaint, the court should:

(A) Sustain the motion, because Fido on October 15 stated its willingness, and gave assurance of its ability, to perform the contract in January.

(B) Sustain the motion, because Toy Store's lawsuit is premature in any case until after November 15.

(C) Deny the motion, because Toy Store's complaint alleges an actionable tort by Fido.

(D) Deny the motion, because Toy Store's complaint alleges an actionable breach of contract by Fido.

30. For this question only, assume that by November 16, Fido, without legal excuse, has delivered no dogs, and that Toy Store has brought no action against Fido. In an action brought on November 16 by Toy Store against High Finance Company because of Fido's default, Toy Store can recover:

(A) Nothing, because the October 5 assignment by Fido to High Finance of Fido's contract with Toy Store was only an assignment for security.

(B) Nothing, because no record of the October 5 transaction between Fido and High Finance was publicly filed.

(C) $\$ 10,000$ in damages, because Toy Store was a third-party intended beneficiary of the October 5 transaction between Fido and High Finance. (D) $\$ 10,000$ in damages, because the October 5 transaction between Fido and High Finance effected, with respect to Toy Store as creditor, a novation of debtors.

\section{Question 31}

In March, when Ohm was 17, Stereo delivered to $\mathrm{Ohm}$ a television set. At that time Ohm agreed in writing to pay $\$ 400$ for the set on July 1 , when he would reach his 18 th birthday. Eighteen is the applicable statutory age of majority, and on that date $\mathrm{Ohm}$ was to receive the proceeds of a trust. On July 1, when the reasonable value of the television set was $\$ 250$, Ohm sent Stereo a signed letter stating, "I'll only pay you $\$ 300$. That is all the set is worth."

In an action against $\mathrm{Ohm}$ for money damages on July 2 , what is the maximum amount that Stereo will be entitled to recover?
(A) Nothing.
(B) $\$ 250$, the reasonable value of the set.
(C) $\$ 300$, the amount $\mathrm{Ohm}$ promised to pay in his letter of July 1.
(D) $\$ 400$, the original sale price.

\section{Question 32}

Ann leased commercial property to Brenda for a period of 10 years. The lease contained the following provision: "No subleasing or assignment will be permitted unless with the written consent of the lessor." One year later, Brenda assigned all interest in the lease to Carolyn, who assumed and agreed to perform the lessee's obligations under the terms of the lease. Ann learned of the assignment and wrote to Brenda that she had no objection to the assignment to Carolyn and agreed to accept rent from Carolyn instead of Brenda. Thereafter, Carolyn paid rent to Ann for a period of five years. Carolyn then defaulted and went into bankruptcy. In an appropriate action, Ann sued Brenda for rent due. If Ann loses, it will be because there was:
(A) Laches.
(B) An accord and satisfaction.
(C) A novation.
(D) An attornment.

Questions 33-34 are based on the following fact situation:

Furrow leased in writing a 100 -acre farm from Quark for five years at $\$ 2,000$ per year, with an option to purchase "five acres of the land for $\$ 10,000$ cash" at the end of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, Quark orally promised to have a five-acre parcel surveyed before the end of the lease term. Furrow took possession of the farm and paid the rent for five years. During the fifth year, having decided that he would exercise the purchase option, Furrow planted several fruit trees and built a large grain silo on the property. At the end of the term, Furrow tendered Quark $\$ 10,000$ and demanded a conveyance, but Quark repudiated the option agreement and retook possession of the farm. He had never had the five-acre parcel surveyed.

33. In an action by Furrow against Quark for specific performance of the option agreement, which of the following is Quark's best defense?
(A) The option part of the agreement is unenforceable because it lacked a separate consideration.
(B) The description of the property to be sold in the parties' written agreement is too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.
(C) Quark's failure to have the five-acre parcel surveyed was failure of a condition precedent to his own duty of performance. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

(D) The option part of the agreement is unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.

34. Assume for this question only that Quark is not liable to Furrow for breach of a landsale contract. In an action by Furrow against Quark for the reasonable value of the improvements that Furrow added to the farm, which of the following theories would best support Furrow's claim?

(A) Quasi-contract, for benefits unofficiously and non-gratuitously conferred upon Quark by Furrow. (B) Tort, for conversion by Quark in retaking possession of the improvements.

(C) Breach of trust by Quark as trustee of a resulting trust of the improvements.

(D) Breach by Quark of an implied-in-fact promise (manifested by his retaking possession of the farm and improvements) to compensate Furrow for the improvements. 

\section{CONTRACTS ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(C) Although this assignment of rights would result in the performance of personal services, the nature of the personal service described here appears to be routine rather than unique and thus the duty is delegable. Note also that the contract contains no language restricting assignment or delegation. (Note also that language "assigning the contract" may be construed to include a delegation of duties.) Thus, Boone (the obligee) would be required to accept performance by the delegate (Coot). Therefore, (B), which states that Boone may refuse to accept such performance, is incorrect. Because the contract does not prohibit Addie's assignment thereof, (A) incorrectly states that such assignment renders Addie in breach. (D) is incorrect because a novation substitutes a new party for an original party to the contract, and requires the assent of all parties, and completely releases the original party. The facts here do not indicate that Boone agreed to any such new arrangement.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(A) The delegator remains personally liable on his contract, even if the delegate has expressly assumed the duties. Thus, Addie remains liable for any defective performance of the painting. (B) and (C) each are based on the incorrect assumption that the obligee is required to look to the delegate for a remedy in the event of defective performance. As explained above, the obligee (Boone) may hold the delegator (Addie) liable on the contract. (D) is incorrect because the facts do not indicate that Boone accepted performance by a new party with knowledge that there was an intent to substitute that party for an original party to the contract. Therefore, Boone did not waive his rights against Addie.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(C) Because Johnston promised to pay without inspecting the goods, he had no right to inspect prior to payment. If payment is due before inspection, the fact that the goods are defective does not excuse nonpayment, unless the defect appears without inspection or there is fraud in the transaction. However, the buyer is not prevented from inspecting the goods after making payment, and thereafter pursuing all available remedies for defective performance. (D) is incorrect because, as explained above, nothing prevents a buyer from promising to pay prior to inspection. (A) is incorrect because the contractual provision at issue does not constitute an acceptance. There is no acceptance until Johnston has had an opportunity to inspect. (B) also incorrectly implies that the provision effectuates a waiver of the buyer's rights.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(C) Where the seller does not deliver or the buyer properly rejects or revokes acceptance of tendered goods, the buyer's basic remedy is the difference between the contract price and either the market price or the cost of buying replacement goods (cover). (C) reflects the latter measure of damages. (A) is incorrect because specific performance is only available where the goods are unique or in other proper circumstances. Here, the wool does not appear to be unique. (B) is incorrect because it sets forth a measure of damages that is properly applicable where the buyer accepts goods that breach one of the seller's warranties; here, the goods have not been accepted. (D) is incorrect because, as explained in the answer to the preceding question, agreeing to pay before inspection does not waive any of the buyer's rights. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(B) Where the buyer has paid for goods which are nonconforming, and the seller has refused the buyer's offer to restore the goods and the buyer's demand for repayment, the buyer may resell the goods and credit the proceeds to the amount owed by the seller (under the same rules that apply to a seller's resale of wrongfully rejected goods). The buyer may sell at either a public or private sale; but if it is a private sale, reasonable advance notice must be given to the seller. [U.C.C. §§2-711(3), 2-706(2), (3)] (A) and (C) each incorrectly limit the sale to being either private or public. (D) incorrectly states that the sale is not permitted at all.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(D) Generally, offers are revocable unless the offeror receives consideration to keep the offer open. If a merchant signs a written offer giving assurances that it will be held open, the offer is irrevocable for the stated period or for a reasonable time if no period is stated. Here, the language at issue would probably be interpreted as a promise not to revoke; however, the offeror (Duffer) is not a merchant (i.e., he does not deal in goods of the kind being sold). Thus, in the absence of consideration being given for this promise, it remains revocable. (A) is incorrect because, although there is a sale of goods, neither of the parties is a merchant, and hence, the "firm offer" provision of the U.C.C. does not apply. (B) makes no sense because the very terms of the offer state that Slicker can accept prior to noon on November 12. (C) is incorrect because no consideration was given for the promise not to countermand.

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(B) Duffer's letter would be construed as an offer that unambiguously calls for completion of performance, rather than a promise, as the only manner of acceptance. This would be an offer for a unilateral contract. An offer for a unilateral contract cannot be accepted by promising to perform. Hence, Slicker's letter of October 9 by itself wouldn't prevent Duffer from revoking his offer. (A) is wrong because a unilateral contract is created only on completion of performance of the bargained-for act, not by simply mailing a purported acceptance. (C) is wrong because the offer was for a unilateral contract. (D) is wrong because, as a response to an offer to enter into a unilateral contract, the promise to perform had no legal effect regardless of when it was received.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(B) An offer is effectively revoked when the offeree acquires knowledge that the offeror has made an inconsistent contract with another, whether such knowledge is obtained from the offeror or some independent source. (A) is wrong because there was no consideration for the promise to keep the offer open. (C) makes no sense. Whether Slicker's power of accepting the offer is terminated does not depend on the fact that the offer was made by a prospective buyer rather than a prospective seller. (D) is incorrect insofar as it states that the November 11 conversation was also an offer to purchase; the wording used by Koolcat ("would you consider ...") seems too preliminary in nature and thus more an invitation than an offer.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(D) An assignor may not enforce rights against an obligor that have been previously assigned, as is the case here. An assignment establishes privity of contract between the obligor and the assignee while extinguishing privity between the obligor and assignor. Thus, the assignee replaces the assignor as the real party in interest, and the assignee alone is entitled to performance under the contract. (A) is incorrect because a promise to pay by check does not create a right too personal to assign. An attempted assignment is invalid where the rights "assigned" would result in the obligor having to perform unique personal services to someone other than the original obligee. Paying by check does not constitute such a personal service. (B) is incorrect because possession of the memorandum of settlement has no bearing on the effectiveness of an assignment. (C) is wrong because minority does not vitiate a contract, but makes it voidable by the minor. Furthermore, insurance contracts usually cannot be voided by minors.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(D) Insurance contracts usually cannot be voided by infants. Thus, the liability insurance, and settlement agreement arising out of it, are valid. (A) seems to be based on the incorrect assumption that, because of Tortfeasor's minority at the time the liability policy was issued, Insurer might not be bound on the contract of insurance. Actually, the effect of a contract entered into between an infant and an adult is that the contract is voidable by the infant but binding on the adult. Thus, there is no question that Tortfeasor has rights under the liability policy. (B) assumes that Tortfeasor's minority constitutes a defense. As explained above, this is incorrect. (C) is incorrect for the same reason.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(A) If both parties knew of Carpenter's schedule limitation at the time the contract was entered into, the supervening flood would discharge the duty to perform by impossibility, because no one could have performed during the month of March. The requirement that the impossibility must arise after the contract was entered into has been met. Since the impossibility is temporary, it could be argued that the impossibility only suspends contractual duties rather than discharging them. However, if it was specifically understood that the only time for performance was the month of March, then the contract should be discharged by impossibility. (B) is wrong because this would actually argue for a continuing duty on the part of Carpenter to make the repairs. (C) is wrong because it would not be relevant. With no additional facts, Carpenter could have begun performance in January and incurred no extra costs. (D) is wrong because it does not speak to whether Carpenter could have performed either before or after March.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(D) On March 12, Adams terminated his offer by communicating his revocation to the offeree before Dawes had accepted. Since the revocation was directly communicated to the offeree, it was immediately effective. Because the offer was revoked, Dawes no longer had any power of acceptance. (A) is wrong because Adams's assurance did not create an option contract. Dawes gave no value for an option contract, and Adams did not assure Dawes that the offer would remain open to her personally until March 14, but only that the offer would remain open generally until that date. (B) is wrong because Adams's failure to sell the car is of no import. Adams's statement clearly communicated the intent to revoke the offer and thus terminated the offer to Dawes. (C) is wrong because even if Dawes had tendered the $\$ 3,000$ on March 13, Adams need not have conveyed the automobile because he had already terminated the offer.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(C) Carver had no duty to disclose to Page the true value of the stock. If, however, Carver had represented that the stock was not worth more than $\$ 6$ a share, this would have constituted material misrepresentation and no contract would result. (A) is wrong because Carver's knowledge of the true value did not create a duty to disclose that knowledge. (B) is wrong because there was no 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

duty to inform Page of the true value of the inventory. (D) is wrong because if Carver had misrepresented the value of the stock, availability of Chemco's financial statement to Page would not relieve Carver of liability.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(A) Since the contract stipulated F.O.B. Singer's place of business, the risk of loss passed to Byer on January 30 when Singer placed the chairs on board a carrier. Thus, the loss of the chairs must be borne by Byer, and Singer is entitled to the contract price. Wheeler, as Singer's assignee, is entitled to the contract price. (B) is wrong as this is the measure where the buyer refuses the goods and the seller then resells them to someone else. Here, since the chairs do not exist any more, the measure of damages would be the entire contract price. (C) is wrong because the contract stipulated F.O.B. Singer's place of business. If it had not so stated, the statement in (C) would be correct. (D) is wrong because, absent circumstances suggesting otherwise, a clause prohibiting the assignment of "the contract" will be construed as barring only the delegation of the assignor's duties, not the assignment of the right to receive payment.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(D) In a contract that specifies that delivery is F.O.B. (free on board) a particular point, the F.O.B. point is the delivery point. If the contract is F.O.B. the seller's place of shipment, the seller need only, at his expense and risk, put the goods in the hands of the carrier. If the contract is F.O.B. destination, the seller must, at his expense and risk, tender delivery of the goods at the designated destination. Here, the risk of loss had passed to Byer because the contract specifically stated that delivery was to be F.O.B. Singer's place of business. (A) and (B) are incorrect because, as explained above, the terms of the contract establish that the risk of loss was not on Singer. (C) is wrong because Singer had already performed by delivering the chairs to the carrier.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(D) No contract was formed between the parties because Plummer gave Ohner a counteroffer rather than an acceptance. If the language had been different, this might have been an acceptance conditioned on higher payment, but given the wording, there were no clear words of acceptance. The making of the counteroffer made acceptance of the original offer impossible, and since Ohner never accepted the counteroffer, no contract was formed between the parties. (A) is wrong because at that point Plummer no longer had power of acceptance on the original offer. (B) is wrong because if Plummer's writing had been a valid acceptance, it would have been valid upon posting under the mailbox rule. (C) is wrong because Ohner's original offer was to be accepted by reply rather than by conduct, and it terminated when Plummer made his counteroffer.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(A) A condition precedent is one which must occur before an absolute duty of immediate performance arises in the other party. Here, because performance was expressly conditioned upon Ohner's obtaining a loan and since that loan was refused, no duty to perform exists. (B) is wrong because the agreement was made before the signing of the contract. (C) is wrong because the agreement does not contradict and is in addition to the meaning of the written contract. (D) is wrong because Ohner is not attempting to deny the validity of the written agreement.

\section{Answer to Question 18}

(D) Parties to a contract may modify it by mutual assent. While consideration is necessary to modify a contract, courts usually find consideration to be present in that each party has limited his right to enforce the original contract on its own terms. On May 3, the parties modified the original contract by making other arrangements for payment which were then met. This modification served to discharge the terms in the original contract regarding payment, so Neese has no claim to the $\$ 5,000$. (A) is wrong because even though Neese was an intended beneficiary of the contract, her rights in it had not vested when the modification was made on May 3 , because she had not yet learned of the contract. (B) is wrong because the contract was not assigned to Neese. Rather, she was an intended beneficiary of the contract. (C) is wrong because an intended beneficiary need not furnish any consideration, so long as the original contract is supported by consideration.

\section{Answer to Question 19}

(C) Miller's strongest argument is that since the contract, by its own terms, could not be performed within a year, it was subject to the Statute of Frauds and should have been in writing. Since it was not, it is void under the Statute of Frauds. (A) would be a possible argument, but it is not as strong as the Statute of Frauds argument. Further, it would probably fail as there does appear to be manifest intent to contract. (B) is wrong because if there was a valid contract, it would not have been terminated by Gray's death. Rather, Gray's estate would have been liable for the monies owed. (D) is wrong because this was not a divisible contract.

\section{Answer to Question 20}

(B) Esther's argument would be that her hard work academically constituted her consideration for the agreement. It is not required that consideration be economic in nature. (A) is wrong because if the only defense is lack of consideration, Esther should keep arguing on contractual terms. Even in arguing under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, Esther would have to establish that she relied on the promise to her detriment. (C) is wrong because the "bonus" provision was an integral part of the contract. (D) is wrong because there is no legal duty to try one's hardest in academic pursuits, so Esther had no preexisting duty to excel.

\section{Answer to Question 21}

(C) Since Baker contracted for 100 bushels on August 1, Zeller had a contractual duty which was breached by the tendering of only 95 bushels. Baker has a cause of action for that breach. (A) is wrong because substantial performance does not excuse total performance of contractual duties. (B) is wrong because discharge by impossibility only occurs where impossibility is objective. The fact that Zeller only had 95 bushels created a subjective rather than an objective impossibility of performance, and thus did not excuse his breach. (D) is wrong because Baker was entitled to performance on August 1.

\section{Answer to Question 22}

(C) Under Article Two of the U.C.C., Selco's notice of May 10 would be considered an action which increases the risk of nonperformance, but does not clearly indicate that performance will not be forthcoming. Thus, it will not immediately be treated as a repudiation. The notice constitutes reasonable grounds for insecurity, entitling Byco to demand adequate assurance of due performance. Until Byco receives such assurance, it may suspend its own performance. (C) is the only answer embodying these principles. (A) and (B) are incorrect because they treat Selco's notice as an anticipatory repudiation. (D) is incorrect because it implies that Byco may not suspend its own performance until receipt of adequate assurances. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

\section{Answer to Question 23}

(D) Selco's notice of June 10 made it clear that it was unable or unwilling to perform. In such circumstance, the aggrieved party may: (i) await performance for a commercially reasonable time; (ii) resort to any remedy for breach even though he has also urged the other party to perform; or (iii) suspend his own performance. The repudiating party may, at any time before his next performance is due, withdraw his repudiation unless the other party has canceled, materially changed her position in reliance on the repudiation, or otherwise indicated that she considers the repudiation final. From the foregoing, (A), (B), and (C) are clearly correct statements of the parties' legal status after June 10. (D) is an incorrect statement (and, thus, the correct answer) because, in actuality, Byco may assert its cause of action immediately, without giving Selco a commercially reasonable time to perform.

\section{Answer to Question 24}

(D) Where the parties to a contract express their agreement in a writing with the intent that it embody the full and final expression of their bargain, any other expressions made prior to or contemporaneous with the writing are inadmissible to vary the terms of the writing. This is the parol evidence rule. In this case, the memorandum clearly states the time of repayment as September 1 . If Vault were permitted to prove Kernel's oral commitment to repay the loan by July 1, this would be permitting the introduction of an expression prior to the writing, to vary the terms of the writing. (A) is incorrect because the parol evidence rule bars evidence of the oral agreement regardless of whether such agreement was supported by consideration. (B) is incorrect because the memorandum contains no ambiguity requiring further exposition of the parties' intent. (C) is incorrect because the preexisting duty rule relates to the issue of consideration, which is not at issue here.

\section{Answer to Question 25}

(D) The Statute of Frauds provides, inter alia, that a promise to answer for the debt or default of another must be in writing, except where the main purpose of the promisor is to serve a pecuniary interest of his own. Gritz's oral promise to guarantee the loan falls within the ambit of the Statute. Proof of such promise is barred, regardless of whether it was supported by separate consideration. Thus, (C) is incorrect. (A) is incorrect because Gritz signed the memorandum in his capacity as president of Kernel, not in an individual capacity. (B) is incorrect because Gritz, as president of Kernel, appears to be a mere employee, not someone with an ownership interest. There is no indication that Gritz will benefit from the loan.

\section{Answer to Question 26}

(B) Specific performance is appropriate where the legal remedy is inadequate. The legal remedy is inadequate where land is the subject of the contract. Although theoretically the seller of land will be fully compensated by money damages, the courts will usually grant specific performance to the seller, because land is considered unique. Thus, (A) is incorrect. Although Bard did not have title to Broadacres at the time he entered into the option contract with Cutter, he did own the option to buy the property. By exercising his option under his agreement with Osif, Bard could have obtained title to Broadacres. This, in turn, would have enabled Bard to convey to Cutter, if the latter exercised his option. Thus, Bard could have been compelled to perform. Because Bard is able to perform, and Cutter has exercised his option for purchase of the land, the case is an appropriate one for specific performance. Only (B) reaches this conclusion. 

\section{Answer to Question 27}

(D) Prodigal was a third-party beneficiary of the original Mater-Vault deposit agreement. A thirdparty beneficiary's rights do not vest (i.e., are modifiable) until he: manifests assent to the promise, brings suit to enforce the promise, or materially changes position in justifiable reliance on the promise. None of these vesting acts occurred before the modification here; in fact, Prodigal did not even know of the first contract until after the modification. Thus, his rights had not vested, and the terms of the second Mater-Vault deposit agreement control the disposition of the funds. Thus, (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect, because even if Prodigal were an assignee, this gratuitous assignment would be revocable. (C) is incorrect because Prodigal's rights could have vested without obtaining possession of the passbook.

\section{Answer to Question 28}

(C) This question involves an assignment. Generally, a gratuitous assignment is revocable. However, an assignment is irrevocable if a token chose involving the rights to be assigned (e.g., a savings account passbook) is delivered. In such a case, the assignor loses both the right and the power to revoke. (C) is the only alternative that embodies these principles. (A) and (B) are wrong because they are based on the revocability of the gift. (D) is wrong because there is no showing of detrimental reliance on the part of Prodigal. Thus, there is no estoppel.

\section{Answer to Question 29}

(D) Where the other party's words, actions, or circumstances make it clear that she is unwilling or unable to perform, the aggrieved party may, inter alia, resort to any remedy for breach. By informing Toy Store that the shaft cannot be repaired or replaced until January, Fido has made it clear that it is unable to perform by the agreed-upon date of November 15 . This is a material breach, because the contract indicates that delivery must be made in time for the Christmas shopping season. Thus, Toy Store is entitled to bring an action for damages. Thus, (B) is incorrect. (A) is incorrect because performance by January does not satisfy Fido's contractual undertaking. (C) is incorrect because, although Fido's night supervisor may have been negligent, it is clear that the appropriate cause of action against Fido is based on breach of its contractual agreement to deliver the dogs by November 15 .

\section{Answer to Question 30}

(A) An assignment of "the contract" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and, unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is also a delegation of performance of the assignor's duties. Here, the October 5 assignment constituted an assignment for security, pursuant to which only Fido's rights, not its duties, under its contract with Toy Store were transferred. (B) is incorrect because even if the October 5 transaction had been filed, this would not change the fact that High Finance had not assumed Fido's duties under the contract. (C) is incorrect because Toy Store was never intended to benefit from this assignment for security. (D) is incorrect because High Finance was not substituted as a new party in place of Fido, nor did Toy Store consent thereto, both of which are requirements for a novation.

\section{Answer to Question 31}

(C) A contract entered into by a minor is voidable at his election. Upon reaching majority, the minor may affirm, i.e., choose to be bound by the contract. If he retains the benefits of the contract after reaching majority, he is liable for the fair market value of the goods. Here, Ohm, who contracted to pay for the television while still an infant, could have chosen to avoid the entire contract. However, upon reaching majority, Ohm not only retained the set, but expressly affirmed the contract to the extent of $\$ 300$. Therefore, Stereo may recover against Ohm on the contract, but only to the extent that he has chosen to be bound ( $\$ 300$ ). Thus, (C) is correct. (A) is wrong because Ohm affirmed the contract after reaching 18 and so must pay for the set. (B) is wrong because Ohm expressly agreed to pay more than fair market value. (D) is wrong because Ohm was not liable on the contract made while he was a minor.

\section{Answer to Question 32}

(C) If Ann loses it will be because there was a novation. A novation occurs when a new contract substitutes a new party to receive benefits and assume duties that had belonged to one of the original parties under the terms of an old contract. All the parties must agree to the substitution. A novation discharges the old contract. The elements of a valid novation are: (i) a previous valid contract; (ii) an agreement among all parties, including the new party to the new contract; (iii) the immediate extinguishment of contractual duties as between the original parties; and (iv) a valid and enforceable new contract. When lessor Ann wrote to Carolyn agreeing to accept rent and Carolyn began to do so, a new contract was formed, and Ann's rights against Brenda were extinguished. (A) is incorrect because laches is not available here. Laches is an equitable defense available when a party delays in bringing an equitable suit and the delay prejudices the defendant. The action here (for back rent) is at law, not equity. Moreover, nothing in the facts indicates that Ann delayed in bringing her action. Thus, laches is not available. (B) is incorrect because there was no accord and satisfaction. An accord occurs when the parties to a contract agree to substitute a different duty for an existing duty under the contract. Satisfaction occurs when the new duty is performed. There was no new duty here; rather, the parties agreed to substitute a new party under an existing contract (a novation). (D) is incorrect because attornment arises when the tenant agrees to accept a new landlord, and here Ann remained the landlord at all times.

\section{Answer to Question 33}

(B) Quark's best defense is that the description is too indefinite. Specific performance will not be granted unless there is an enforceable contract. For a contract for the sale of land to be enforceable, there must be an adequate description of the subject property. A description of "five acres" from a 100 -acre tract is not sufficient because it does not describe which five acres were intended. Thus, specific performance will not be available. (A) is incorrect because the option agreement was a term of the contract between Quark and Furrow. As such, it was fully supported by the consideration (payment of the rent) on the contract. It was not an additional agreement requiring further consideration. (C) is incorrect because a condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty of immediate performance arises in the other party. The survey was not such a condition. When Furrow tendered the $\$ 10,000$ for the five acres, Furrow had a duty to perform. Nowhere in the contract itself, or extrinsically, is there an indication that Furrow's option may not be exercised until a survey is made. (D) is incorrect because the option term of the contract is a part of the written contract and does not require proof via parol evidence.

\section{Answer to Question 34}

(A) Quasi-contract is the best theory because it is the standard remedy to avoid unjust enrichment in the case of a failed contract. Here, Furrow did not intend to gratuitously confer a benefit on Quark, but rather he conferred the benefit in reliance on Quark's promise that Quark would convey five acres to Furrow. If Quark were allowed to keep the benefits under such conditions, he would be unjustly enriched. (B) is incorrect because conversion deals with the wrongful taking or retention of chattels. Here, the fruit trees became part of the land and so were not chattels. Moreover, it was not wrongful for Quark to keep the trees since they were affixed to his property. (C) is incorrect because resulting trusts arise only where an attempted trust has failed. There was no attempt to create a trust here. (D) is incorrect because the general rule is that at the end of a lease, the owner is entitled to keep any improvements that the tenant has made that have become securely affixed to the premises. Retaining such property does not imply a promise to pay for the improvements.

\section{Question 1}

In which of the following situations is Defendant's claim of intoxication most likely to result in his being found not guilty?

(A) Defendant is charged with manslaughter for a death resulting from an automobile accident. Defendant, the driver, claims he was so drunk he was unable to see the other car involved in the accident.

(B) Defendant is charged with assault with intent to kill Watts, as a result of his wounding Watts by shooting him. Defendant claims he was so drunk he did not realize anyone else was around when he fired the gun.

(C) Defendant is charged with armed robbery. He claims he was so drunk he did not know whether the gun was loaded.

(D) Defendant is charged with statutory rape, after he had sexual intercourse with a girl aged 15 , in a jurisdiction where the age of consent is 16 . Defendant claims he was so drunk he did not realize the girl was a minor.

\section{Question 2}

Jackson and Brannick planned to break into a federal government office to steal food stamps. Jackson telephoned Crowley one night and asked whether Crowley wanted to buy some "hot" food stamps. Crowley, who understood that "hot" meant stolen, said, "Sure, bring them right over." Jackson and Brannick then successfully executed their scheme. That same night they delivered the food stamps to Crowley, who bought them for $\$ 500$. Crowley did not ask when or by whom the stamps were stolen. All three were arrested. Jackson and Brannick entered guilty pleas in federal court to a charge of larceny in connection with the theft. Crowley was brought to trial in the state court on a charge of conspiracy to steal food stamps. On the evidence stated, Crowley should be found:

(A) Guilty, because, when a new confederate enters a conspiracy already in progress, he becomes a party to it.

(B) Guilty, because he knowingly and willingly aided and abetted the conspiracy and is chargeable as a principal.

(C) Not guilty, because, although Crowley knew the stamps were stolen, he neither helped to plan nor participated or assisted in the theft.

(D) Not guilty, because Jackson and Brannick had not been convicted of or charged with conspiracy, and Crowley cannot be guilty of conspiracy by himself.

\section{Question 3}

Jack and Paul planned to hold up a bank. They drove to the bank in Jack's car. Jack entered while Paul remained as lookout in the car. After a few moments, Paul panicked and drove off.

Jack looked over the various tellers, approached one and whispered nervously, "Just hand over the cash. Don't look around, don't make a false move-or it's your life." The teller looked at the fidgeting Jack, laughed, flipped him a dollar bill, and said, "Go on, beat it." Flustered, Jack grabbed the dollar and left.

Paul's best defense to a charge of robbery would be that:

(A) Jack alone entered the bank.

(B) Paul withdrew, before commission of the crime, when he fled the scene.

(C) Paul had no knowledge of what Jack whispered to the teller.

(D) The teller was not placed in fear by Jack.

\section{Question 4}

Adam and Bailey, brothers, operated an illicit still. They customarily sold to anyone unless they suspected the person of being a revenue agent or an informant. One day when Adam was at the still alone, he was approached by Mitchell, who asked to buy a gallon of liquor. Mitchell was in fact a revenue officer. After Adam had sold him the liquor, Mitchell revealed his identity. Adam grabbed one of the rifles that the brothers kept handy in case of trouble with the law, and shot and wounded Mitchell. Other officers, hiding nearby, overpowered and arrested Adam.

Shortly thereafter, Bailey came on the scene. The officers in hiding had been waiting for him. One of them approached him and asked to buy liquor. Bailey was suspicious and refused to sell. The officers nevertheless arrested him.

Adam and Bailey were charged with conspiracy to violate revenue laws, illegal selling of liquor, and battery of the officer.

On the charge of battery, which statement concerning Adam and Bailey is true?
(A) Neither is guilty.
(B) Both are guilty.
(C) Adam is guilty but Bailey is not, because the conspiracy had terminated with the arrest of Adam.
(D) Adam is guilty but Bailey is not, because Adam's act was outside the scope of the conspiracy.

\section{Question 5}

Dent, while eating in a restaurant, noticed that a departing customer at the next table had left a five-dollar bill as a tip for the waitress. Dent reached over, picked up the five-dollar bill, and put it in his pocket. As he stood up to leave, another customer who had seen him take the money ran over to him and hit him in the face with her umbrella. Enraged, Dent choked the customer to death. Dent is charged with murder. He requests the court to charge the jury that they can find him guilty of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder. Dent's request should be:

(A) Granted, because the jury could find that Dent acted recklessly and not with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.

(B) Granted, because the jury could find that being hit in the face with an umbrella constitutes adequate provocation.

(C) Denied, because the evidence shows that Dent intended to kill or to cause serious bodily harm.

(D) Denied, because the evidence shows that Dent provoked the assault on himself by his criminal misconduct.

\section{Question 6}

Brown suffered from the delusion that he was a special agent of God. He frequently experienced hallucinations in the form of hearing divine commands. Brown believed God told him several times that the local Roman Catholic bishop was corrupting the diocese into heresy, and that the bishop should be "done away with." Brown, a devout Catholic, conceived of himself as a religious martyr. He knew that shooting bishops for heresy is against the criminal law. $\mathrm{He}$ nevertheless carefully planned how he might kill the bishop. One evening Brown shot the bishop, who was taken to the hospital, where he died two weeks later.

Brown told the police he assumed the institutions of society would support the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and he expected to be persecuted for his God-inspired actions. Psychiatrist Stevens examined Brown and found that Brown suffered from schizophrenic psychosis, that in the absence of this psychosis he would not have shot the bishop, and that because of the psychosis Brown found it extremely difficult to determine whether he should obey the specific command that he do away with the bishop or the general commandment "Thou shalt not kill"; Brown was charged with murder. If Brown interposes an insanity defense and the jurisdiction in which he is tried has adopted only the M'Naghten test of insanity, then the strongest argument for the defense under that test is that:

(A) Brown did not know the nature of the act he was performing.

(B) Brown did not know that his act was morally wrong.

(C) Brown did not know the quality of the act he was performing.

(D) Brown's acts were the product of a mental disease.

\section{Question 7}

In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be guilty of common law murder?

(A) During an argument in a bar, Norris punches Defendant. Defendant, mistakenly believing that Norris is about to stab him, shoots and kills Norris.

(B) While committing a robbery of a liquor store, Defendant accidentally drops his revolver, which goes off. The bullet strikes and kills Johnson, a customer in the store.

(C) While hunting deer, Defendant notices something moving in the bushes. Believing it to be a deer, Defendant fires into the bushes. The bullet strikes and kills Griggs, another hunter.

(D) In celebration of the Fourth of July, Defendant discharges a pistol within the city limits in violation of a city ordinance. The bullet ricochets off the street and strikes and kills Abbott.

\section{Question 8}

Dutton, disappointed by his eight-year-old son's failure to do well in school, began systematically depriving the child of food during summer vacation. Although his son became seriously ill from malnutrition, Dutton failed to call a doctor. He believed that as a parent he had the sole right to determine whether the child was fed or received medical treatment. Eventually, the child died. An autopsy disclosed that the child had suffered agonizingly as a result of the starvation, that a physician's aid would have alleviated the suffering, and that although the child would have died in a few months from malnutrition, the actual cause of death was an untreatable form of cancer.

The father was prosecuted for murder, defined in the jurisdiction as "unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought." 'The father should be:

(A) Acquitted, because of the defendant's good faith belief concerning parental rights in supervising children.

(B) Acquitted, because summoning the physician or feeding the child would not have prevented the child's death from cancer.

(C) Convicted, because the father's treatment of his son showed a reckless indifference to the value of life.

(D) Convicted, because the child would have died from malnutrition had he not been afflicted with cancer.

\section{Question 9}

Vance had cheated Dodd in a card game. Angered, Dodd set out for Vance's house with the intention of shooting him. Just as he was about to set foot on Vance's property, Dodd was arrested by a police officer who noticed that Dodd was carrying a revolver. A statute in the jurisdiction makes it a crime to "enter the property of another with the intent to commit any crime of violence thereon."

If charged with attempting to violate the statute, Dodd should be found:

(A) Not guilty, because the statute defines an attempt crime and there cannot be an attempt to attempt. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

(B) Not guilty, because to convict him would be to punish him simply for having a guilty mind.

(C) Guilty, because he was close enough to entering the property and he had the necessary state of mind.

(D) Guilty, because this is a statute designed to protect the public from violence, and Dodd was dangerous.

Questions 10-15 are based on the following fact situation and require you to assume that you are in either a TYPE A or a TYPE B jurisdiction:

TYPE A. The homicide statute in this jurisdiction reads in part as follows:

Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Such malice may be express or implied. It is express when there is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature. It is implied when no considerable provocation appears or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart. Every person guilty of murder shall suffer death or confinement in the state prison for life, at the discretion of the jury trying the same.

TYPE B. The homicide statute in this jurisdiction reads in part as follows:

Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Such malice may be express or implied. It is express when there is manifested a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature. It is implied when no considerable provocation appears or when the circumstances attending the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart. All murder that is perpetrated by willful, deliberate, or premeditated killing or that is committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate arson, rape, robbery, or burglary is murder of the murder in the first degree shall suffer death or confinement in the state prison for life, at the discretion of the jury trying the same. Every person convicted of murder in the second degree shall be confined in the state prison for life.

Both TYPE A and TYPE B jurisdictions have a statute reading as follows:

Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice. It is of two kinds:

1. Voluntary-upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.

2. Involuntary-in the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony; or in the commission of a lawful act that might produce death in an unlawful manner or without due caution and circumspection.

Manslaughter is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison not exceeding 15 years.

Victor and Defendant were 16 and 17 , respectively. Both were old enough to be legally responsible for a crime in the particular jurisdiction. By prearrangement they met at the Dairy Shoppe, a teenage hangout. They were depressed. It had been raining for some days, and school had been out for several weeks. Defendant asked Victor if he would like to play Russian roulette. They played with a revolver, as they had done before. The cylinder of the revolver had six chambers, from which they would remove all but one cartridge. One of them would then spin the cylinder, point the revolver at the other's head, and fire it. With six chambers and one cartridge, the odds were 5 to 1 that the revolver would not fire.

Defendant obtained the revolver from his parents' bedroom. Adam, his father, kept the revolver in the bedroom at all times. Adam repeatedly bragged that he kept a loaded revolver in his room. Defendant took the revolver in his pocket, and then proceeded to the Dairy Shoppe. Victor agreed to play Russian roulette. Defendant, pointing the revolver at Victor's head, pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. Victor then spun the cylinder and pointed the revolver at Defendant's head. He pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. Defendant spun the cylinder and pointed the revolver at Victor's head. He pulled the trigger. The gun fired. He was heard to exclaim: "Victor, Victor, I didn't think it would shoot! I'm sorry!" Victor died en route to the hospital.

10. Defendant is charged with murder in a TYPE A jurisdiction. Which of the following is the soundest result?
(A) Not guilty, because consent is a complete defense.
(B) Not guilty, because the negligence of Adam is a complete defense.
(C) Guilty of murder.
(D) Guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

11. Defendant is charged with first degree murder in a TYPE B jurisdiction. Which of the following is Defendant's soundest theory of defense?

(A) Laws making a 17-year-old liable for any homicide are unconstitutional as imposing a cruel and unusual punishment.

(B) A revolver with only one of its six chambers loaded is not a deadly weapon, and its use therefore cannot prove deliberate killing.

(C) Defendant, because of his youth, could not have the malice aforethought required for murder.

(D) Defendant is guilty of murder, but his deed does not fall within the definition of first degree murder.

12. Defendant is charged with murder in a TYPE A jurisdiction. The trial judge can properly charge the jury on which of the following theories?
(A) Involuntary manslaughter only.
(B) Murder and involuntary manslaughter.
(C) Murder and voluntary manslaughter.
(D) First degree murder, second degree murder, and involuntary manslaugh- ter.

13. Defendant is charged with murder in a TYPE A jurisdiction. Which of the following is the soundest argument of the prosecutor?

(A) Defendant's actions demonstrated an abandoned and malignant heart because he knew his act might cause death or great bodily harm.

(B) The homicide is a felony murder since Victor's death was the result of an assault with a deadly weapon.

(C) Defendant by definition is not a juvenile and can be found guilty of a capital crime.

(D) The negligence of Adam is not a supervening cause which will relieve Defendant of liability.

14. Defendant is charged with first degree murder in a TYPE B jurisdiction. Defendant's best argument for acquittal of first degree murder would be that:
(A) He committed no arson, rape, robbery, or burglary.
(B) He did not deliberate or premeditate.
(C) Victor consented to the homicide.
(D) He did not deliberate, premeditate, or commit a first degree felony murder. 15. Assuming statutes covering the following offenses, in a TYPE A jurisdiction Adam, the father, can be most appropriately charged with:
(A) Assault with a deadly weapon.
(B) Contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
(C) Murder.
(D) Voluntary manslaughter.

Questions 16-17 are based on the following fact situation:

Linda was 15 years old, but she appeared and acted older. When asked, she always said she was 22 , and she carried false identification saying she was that old. She frequented taverns and drank heavily. One evening in a bar she became acquainted with Duke. He believed her when she told him her claimed age. They had several drinks and became inebriated. Later, they drove in Duke's car to a secluded spot. After they had necked for a while, Duke propositioned Linda and she consented. Before Duke achieved penetration, Linda changed her mind, saying, "Stop! Don't touch me! I don't want to do it." When Duke did not desist, Linda started to cry and said, "I am only 15." Duke immediately jumped from the car and ran away. Duke was indicted for attempted rape, assault with intent to rape, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and attempted statutory rape. The age of consent in the jurisdiction is 16 .

16. If the contributing charge were based on a statute reading, "Whoever shall commit an act affecting the morals of a minor under 16 years of age shall be deemed guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for a period not to exceed 5 years," Duke's best legal defense would be that:
(A) The statute is unconstitutionally vague.
(B) Linda consented to his actions.
(C) He was entrapped by Linda's appear- ance.
(D) He did not intend to contribute to her delinquency.

17. With respect to the contributing charge under the statute set out in the question above, proof by Duke that he was so inebriated that he could not have formed a criminal intent would be a:
(A) Good defense, because the charge requires a specific intent.
(B) Good defense, because at least a general criminal intent is required for every offense.
(C) Poor defense, because contributing to the delinquency of a minor is an offense against a child.
(D) Poor defense, because the state of mind of the defendant is irrelevant to this offense, so long as he was legally sane.

Questions 18-20 are based on the following fact situation:

Adams, Bennett, and Curtis are charged in a common law jurisdiction with conspiracy to commit larceny. The state introduced evidence that they agreed to go to Nelson's house to take stock certificates from a safe in Nelson's bedroom, that they went to the house, and that they were arrested as they entered Nelson's bedroom.

Adams testified that he thought the stock certificates belonged to Curtis, that Nelson was improperly keeping them from Curtis, and that he went along to aid in retrieving Curtis's property. Bennett testified that he suspected Adams and Curtis of being thieves and joined up with them in order to catch them. He also testified that he made an anonymous telephone call to the police alerting them to the crime and that the call caused the police to be waiting for them when they walked into Nelson's bedroom.

Curtis did not testify.

18. If the jury believes Adams, it should find him:
(A) Guilty, because there was an agree- ment and the entry into the bedroom is sufficient for the overt act.
(B) Guilty, because good motives are not a defense to criminal liability.
(C) Not guilty, because he did not have a corrupt motive.
(D) Not guilty, because he did not intend to steal.

19. If the jury believes Bennett, it should find him:
(A) Guilty, because there was an agree- ment and the entry into the bedroom is sufficient for the overt act.
(B) Guilty, because he is not a police officer and thus cannot claim any privilege of apprehending criminals.
(C) Not guilty, because he did not intend to steal.
(D) Not guilty, because he prevented the theft from occurring.

20. If the jury believes both Adams and Bennett, it should find Curtis:

(A) Guilty, because there was an agreement and the entry into the bedroom is sufficient for the overt act.

(B) Guilty, because he intended to steal. (C) Not guilty, because a conviction would penalize him for exercising his right not to be a witness.

(D) Not guilty, because Adams and Bennett did not intend to steal.

Questions 21-25 are based on the four case summaries below. For each question, select the case that would be most applicable as a precedent:

(A) Commonwealth v. Mason. Two brothers see a wealthy neighbor's pedigreed dog on the street. They take the dog home, intending to conceal it until the owner offers a reward. Held, guilty of larceny.

(B) Saferite $v$. State. Two young men saw a motor car on the street with the keys in the ignition lock. They drove the car to a neighboring town with the intention, they said, of visiting the wife of one of them. The car was wrecked on their way back. Conviction for larceny reversed.

(C) People v. Noblett. Defendant, a tenant of a city apartment, advertised it for sublease. Will agreed to sublease for three months, and on March 12 paid Defendant \$550, the total agreed rental. Will was to receive possession on March 20, but possession was never given him. Held, not guilty of common law larceny.

(D) King v. Pear. From a stablekeeper, Defendant hired a horse to go to Sutton and back, saying he would be back at 8 p.m. He did not return. Investigation showed that Defendant had given a false address, and that he had sold the horse the same day. Conviction of larceny affirmed.

21. Davis paid Realtor $\$ 500$ as down payment on a house. That night, Davis broke into a hardware store and took a brace and bit. Davis broke into Realtor's office and used the tools to open the safe, where he had seen Realtor place the $\$ 500$. The safe was empty. Davis's fingerprints on the tools, left lying in front of the safe, led to his arrest. He is charged with larceny of the tools.

22. Smith placed a newspaper advertisement reading, "Wanted: responsible man to collect for large firm. $\$ 500$ security required. Address Box 66, Times." Vincent answered the ad and was called on by Smith, who said he represented Ames Advertising Agency. He took Vincent to the office of the company (a large actual firm), but as they were about to enter the building Smith said, "There is Mr. Ames now," and introduced him to a companion of Smith who impersonated Ames. The result of the conversation was that the false Ames agreed to hire Vincent. It was agreed that Vincent would draw $\$ 500$ from the bank to put up as security, and that this money would be placed in a bank and Vincent given a certificate of deposit in his own name. They went to the bank where Vincent gave Smith the money, after which Smith and "Ames" disappeared. Smith was later charged with larceny.

23. Jones, angry at a neighbor with whom he had quarreled, for revenge surreptitiously removed a piece of stone statuary from the neighbor's garden and concealed it in his garage. He intended to replace it a day or two later, after giving the neighbor a chance to feel bad over its being stolen. Suspecting who was guilty, the neighbor had Jones arrested and charged with larceny.

24. Harris, a heroin addict, broke into a home and took several cameras and watches, which he promptly pawned to obtain cash with which to purchase a "fix." Harris was later charged with larceny of the cameras and watches.

25. Allison told Mark that he, Allison, was the legal representative for a syndicate that had a photoelectric machine for making counterfeit money, and to prove that the money was good enough to "pass anywhere," Allison showed what he said was one of the counterfeit $\$ 10$ bills. He said that if Mark would invest $\$ 1,000$, the syndicate would pay him counterfeit money in the amount of $\$ 10,000$. Mark paid the $\$ 1,000$ to Allison, who then disappeared. Allison is caught and charged with larceny.

\section{Question 26}

Ted frequently visited Janet, his next-door neighbor. Janet was separated from her husband, Howard. Howard resided with his mother but jointly owned the house in which Janet resided. Late one night, Ted and Janet were sitting on the bed in Janet's bedroom drinking when Howard burst through the door and told Ted, "Get out!" When Ted refused, Howard challenged him to go outside and "fight it out." Ted again refused. Howard then pulled a knife from his pocket and lunged at Ted. Ted grabbed a lamp, struck Howard on the head, and killed him. Ted is charged with murder.

On a charge of murder, Ted should be found:

(A) Not guilty, because Ted had as much right as Howard to be in the house.

(B) Not guilty, because Howard attacked Ted with a deadly weapon.

(C) Guilty, because Ted's presence in Janet's bedroom prompted Howard's attack.

(D) Guilty, because Ted's failure to obey Howard's order to leave the house made him a trespasser.

\section{Question 27}

Defendant is charged with assault and battery. The state's evidence shows that Victim was struck in the face by Defendant's fist.

In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be not guilty of assault and battery?

(A) Defendant had been hypnotized at a party and ordered by the hypnotist to strike the person he disliked the most. (B) Defendant was suffering from an epileptic seizure and had no control over his motions.

(C) Defendant was heavily intoxicated and was shadow boxing without realizing that Victim was near him.

(D) Defendant, who had just awakened from a deep sleep, was not fully aware of what was happening and mistakenly thought Victim was attacking him.

\section{Question 28}

Donna was arrested and taken to police headquarters, where she was given her Miranda warnings. Donna indicated that she wished to telephone her lawyer and was told that she could do so after her fingerprints had been taken. While being fingerprinted, however, Donna blurted out, "Paying a lawyer is a waste of money because I know you have me."

At trial, Donna's motion to prevent the introduction of the statement she made while being fingerprinted will most probably be:

(A) Granted, because Donna's request to contact her attorney by telephone was reasonable and should have been granted immediately.

(B) Granted, because of the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine.

(C) Denied, because the statements were volunteered and not the result of interrogation.

(D) Denied, because fingerprinting is not a critical stage of the proceeding requiring the assistance of counsel.

\section{Question 29}

Driving down a dark road, Defendant accidentally ran over a man. Defendant stopped and found that the victim was dead. Defendant, fearing that he might be held responsible, took the victim's wallet, which contained a substantial amount of money. He removed the identification papers and put the wallet and money back into the victim's pocket.

Defendant is not guilty of:

(A) Larceny, because he took the papers only to prevent identification and not for his own use.

(B) Larceny, because he did not take anything from a living victim.

(C) Robbery, because he did not take the papers by means of force or putting in fear.

(D) Robbery, because he did not take anything of monetary value.

\section{Question 30}

Tom had a heart ailment so serious that his doctors had concluded that only a heart transplant could save his life. They therefore arranged to have him flown to Big City to have the operation performed.

Dan, Tom's nephew, who stood to inherit from him, poisoned him. The poison produced a reaction which required postponing the journey. The plane on which Tom was to have flown crashed, and all aboard were killed. By the following day, Tom's heart was so weakened by the effects of the poison that he suffered a heart attack and died.

If charged with criminal homicide, Dan should be found:

(A) Guilty.

(B) Not guilty, because his act did not hasten the deceased's death, but instead prolonged his life by one day.

(C) Not guilty, because the deceased was already suffering from a fatal illness.

(D) Not guilty, because the poison was not the sole cause of death. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

Questions 31-32 are based on the following fact situation:

Statutes in the jurisdiction define criminal assault as "an attempt to commit a criminal battery" and criminal battery as "causing an offensive touching."

As Edward was walking down the street, a gust of wind blew his hat off. Edward reached out, trying to grab his hat, and narrowly missed striking Margaret in the face with his hand. Margaret, fearful of being struck by Edward, pushed Edward away.

31. If charged with criminal assault, Edward should be found:

(A) Guilty, because he caused Margaret to be in apprehension of an offensive touching.

(B) Guilty, because he should have realized he might strike someone by reaching out.

(C) Not guilty, because he did not intend to hit Margaret.

(D) Not guilty, because he did not hit Margaret.

32. If charged with criminal battery, Margaret should be found:
(A) Guilty, because she intentionally pushed Edward.
(B) Guilty, because she caused the touch- ing of Edward whether she meant to do so or not.
(C) Not guilty, because a push is not an offensive touching.
(D) Not guilty, because she was justified in pushing Edward.

\section{Question 33}

A state statute makes it a felony for any teacher at a state institution of higher education to accept anything of value from a student at the same institution. Monroe, a student at the state university, offered Professor Smith, his English teacher, $\$ 50$ in exchange for a good grade in his English course. Smith agreed and took the money. Professor Smith and Monroe are tried jointly for violation of the state statute. Professor Smith is charged with violating the statute and Monroe with aiding and abetting him.

Monroe's best argument for a dismissal of the charge against him is that:

(A) A principal and an accessory cannot be tried together, since the principal must be convicted first.

(B) He cannot be an accessory, since he is the victim of the crime.

(C) The legislature did not intend to punish the person giving the thing of value.

(D) He did not assist Professor Smith in violating the statute.

\section{Question 34}

In which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be guilty of larceny?

(A) Defendant took Sue's television set, with the intention of returning it the next day. However, he dropped it and damaged it beyond repair.

(B) Defendant went into Tom's house and took $\$ 100$ in the belief that Tom had damaged Defendant's car to that amount.

(C) Mistakenly believing that larceny does not include the taking of a dog, Defendant took his neighbor's dog and sold it.

(D) Unreasonably mistaking George's car for his own, Defendant got into George's car in a parking lot and drove it home. 

\section{CRIMINAL LAW ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(B) Voluntary intoxication is a defense to a crime that requires intent (assault with intent to kill), and in (B) the intoxication prevented Defendant from formulating the intent to commit the crime. (A) and (D) are incorrect because voluntary intoxication is no defense to crimes involving recklessness or strict liability. (C) is incorrect because Defendant's intoxication did not prevent him from formulating the purpose or intent to commit the crime.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(C) Crowley should be found not guilty because what he did was commit the crime of receiving stolen property knowing it to be stolen. This crime would not be necessary if the mere agreement to purchase the loot after another had already stolen it were enough to make the purchaser a conspirator. (A) is wrong. The point of law stated is accurate enough, but it assumes that simply by agreeing to buy the stamps, Crowley joined in the conspiracy to steal them. (B) is wrong because Crowley did not aid and abet the conspiracy to commit larceny because that conspiracy had already accomplished its target object, the stealing of the stamps. (D) is wrong. It is true that one may not conspire with himself. But it is not true that one who does enter into a conspiracy with one or more people cannot be convicted unless the others are at least charged with the conspiracy. If only one conspirator is prosecuted, however, the prosecution must show that, in fact, others were involved with the defendant on trial.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(D) Paul's best defense is that Jack did not commit a robbery. Robbery is in effect a larceny from the person, committed by force or fear. Here, force was threatened, not actually used. Had the teller felt any apprehension that Jack would use a gun if he did not do what he was told, this would be "fear" even though the victim remained cool and poised while complying with the demands, and knew that as long as he did so, no force would be used. In this case, however, it is obvious that the teller felt no fear at all. (Paul's crime was attempted robbery.) (A) is wrong. Paul was an accomplice to Jack. He would incur vicarious liability for crimes committed by Jack. (B) is wrong. Paul would be an accomplice to attempted robbery (and perhaps larceny) because he did not repudiate his assistance before fleeing; thus, he did not effectively withdraw. (C) is wrong. We are told that Paul and Jack planned to hold up a bank. It is not necessary that the accomplice know all the precise details of how this is to be carried out. It suffices that Paul knew that Jack would use the threat of force to obtain property permanently.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(B) Battery is an unlawful application of force to the person of another resulting in bodily injury or an offensive touching. Adam's shooting and wounding of Mitchell meets all the elements of the crime. Thus, Adam is guilty of battery. Bailey is also guilty of battery because Adam conspired with Bailey to operate an illegal still, and each co-conspirator is liable for the crimes of all other co-conspirators if: (i) the crimes were committed in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy; and (ii) the crimes were a natural and probable consequence of the conspiracy (i.e., foreseeable). The battery was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy (to keep the still in operation) and was foreseeable because the conspirators kept guns on the site in case of trouble with the law, and the wounding of a peace officer would be a "natural and probable" consequence. Thus, (B) is correct, and it follows that (A) must be incorrect. (C) is wrong because even if the conspiracy was terminated by Adam's arrest, the battery occurred before the arrest, when the conspiracy was

clearly ongoing. Bailey made no legally effective withdrawal prior to the battery, and he remains liable for Adam's act. (D) is wrong because, as discussed above, the battery was in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy and a foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy.

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(B) The existence of adequate provocation may reduce a killing to voluntary manslaughter. Being subjected to a serious battery is frequently recognized as constituting adequate provocation. Here, the jury should decide whether being hit in the face with an umbrella qualifies. (A) is incorrect because a finding that Dent acted recklessly would not necessarily suffice to reduce the crime to voluntary manslaughter. Provocation is the key. (C) is incorrect because to the extent that Dent intended to kill or to cause serious bodily harm, he was acting in the wake of a sudden and intense passion that caused him to lose his self-control, which would make voluntary manslaughter applicable. (D) is incorrect because it is questionable whether Dent's taking of the money that had been left for the waitress constituted sufficient reason for the customer to hit him in the face with an umbrella. Thus, the jury should be allowed to consider voluntary manslaughter as an option.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(B) The traditional M'Naghten rule provides that a defendant is entitled to acquittal if the proof establishes that: (a) a disease of the mind; (b) caused a defect of reason; (c) such that the defendant lacked the ability at the time of his actions to either: (i) know the wrongfulness of his actions; or (ii) understand the nature and quality of his actions. (B) is the best answer here, because this option goes directly to the wrongfulness issue and is supported by the facts, which indicate Brown's moral dilemma. His conclusion that direct orders from God overrode the general prohibition against killing indicates that Brown did not know the wrongfulness of his act. (A) and (C) are incorrect because the M'Naghten test speaks of nature and quality, and each of these options contains only one of these two elements. In addition, the facts are less likely to support an assertion that Brown was ignorant of either the nature or quality of his act than that he did not understand it was wrong. (D) is wrong because mental disease is but one element of the M'Naghten test. Acts that occur as a "product of mental disease or defect" fall under the insanity defense in jurisdictions that apply the Durham rule, which is substantially broader than $M$ 'Naghten.

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(B) The defendant is guilty of felony murder in this fact situation, since even an accidental killing committed during the course of a felony constitutes common law murder. Malice is implied from the intent to commit the underlying felony. Since defendant did have the requisite intent to commit the robbery with no defense to cut off liability, he would be liable at common law for the accidental death as well. (A) is wrong, since this fact situation would give the defendant a possible self-defense claim, and if that failed, it would be manslaughter, not common law murder. (C) is wrong because here there was no malice aforethought. At most, the defendant would be guilty of involuntary manslaughter. (D) is not as good a choice as $(B)$ because a jury could find that there was no malice aforethought. Defendant then would be guilty only of misdemeanor manslaughter while committing an "unlawful act," not common law murder.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(B) Dutton would have to be acquitted because his actions did not cause the death of the child. (A) is wrong because the defendant's beliefs about his rights are irrelevant. If the child had died of malnutrition, the defendant's good faith belief concerning parental rights in supervising children would have been of no help to him. (C) is wrong because that reckless indifference did not cause the child's death. (D) is wrong because the child did not actually die from malnutrition.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(C) Vance could not be convicted of actually violating the statute because he did not enter the property of another. However, since he was approaching the property with the requisite state of mind, he could be charged with attempting to violate that statute. (A) is wrong because the statute does not define an attempt crime. Entering onto the property of another is an affirmative action. (B) is wrong because entering the property of another with the intent to commit a crime of violence constitutes more than merely "having a guilty mind." (D) is wrong because it is overbroad and overly subjective.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(C) Defendant's conduct qualifies as a killing with "an abandoned and malignant heart" because it exhibited a reckless indifference to the "very high" risk of death or serious injury. (A) is wrong because consent is not a defense to acts involving serious bodily injury. (B) is wrong because the misconduct of Adam is not a defense to homicide. (D) is wrong because the manslaughter statute requires that the killing be without malice. Here, malice is implied from Defendant's "abandoned and malignant heart."

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(D) Since the felony murder rule is not involved here, the only theory of first degree murder available would be that killing was "willful, deliberate, or premeditated." First degree murder requires an actual intent to kill, which Defendant lacked. (A) is wrong under common law. At common law, it was possible to convict a seven-year-old of a crime. Also, there is nothing under this statute to indicate that a 17-year-old could not be convicted of a crime. Nor is youthfulness (of a defendant over the age of 14) a legally recognized source of "mitigating" a criminal homicide to manslaughter. Hence, (C) is wrong. (B) is wrong because a revolver is a deadly weapon and intentional use of it would support an inference that Defendant intended to kill.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(B) This is the best alternative. The choice as to whether this behavior is wanton or reckless (murder) or criminal or gross negligence (involuntary manslaughter) is best left to the jury. Hence, it would be wrong to instruct the jury "only" on involuntary manslaughter, and thus (A) is incorrect. (D) is wrong because the question relates to a Type A jurisdiction where murder is not divided into degrees. (C) is wrong as there is no way that Defendant would be guilty of voluntary manslaughter, which would involve an unjustified, unexcused but mitigated, intentional homicide. Defendant did not intend to kill or seriously injure.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(A) This question tests your understanding of the "abandoned and malignant heart" terminology still found in many murder statutes. (B) is wrong because "assault with a deadly weapon" is not the "independent" or "collateral felony" required for the felony murder rule. (C) and (D) are wrong because they do not concern issues that would be the most relevant to the murder charges. Both of these cover responses to defenses raised by the defendant rather than a necessary element to be proved by the prosecutor. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(D) This answer covers all the possible ways to commit a first degree murder under a Type B statute (felony murder and premeditative or deliberate). Hence, both (A) and (B) are incomplete and wrong. (C) is wrong because consent of the victim will not excuse, mitigate, or reduce the level of a criminal homicide.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(B) This is the only possible charge. Although the 17-year-old son is old enough to be "legally" responsible for a crime, he is still a minor, and the father's bragging about a loaded revolver in his room could be deemed contributory to his delinquency. At best, the father's act was "criminally" negligent, and therefore any liability on the father's part would not rise above the level of involuntary manslaughter. Therefore, $(\mathrm{C})$ is wrong; merely leaving a loaded gun about is not an "abandoned and malignant heart" situation. (D) is also wrong; the father did not kill Victor as a result of a sudden quarrel or in the heat of passion. (A) is wrong because the father did not assault anyone and also because the assault charge would merge into the murder charge.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(A) The best defense is challenging the statute, because all of the other choices do not offer defenses. Linda's consent is irrelevant under the statute, as is her appearance of being older. Duke's intent is likewise irrelevant under this type of statute, which is a strict liability statute. Therefore, his only possible challenge is that the statute is void for vagueness because it does not apprise a defendant of which acts are proscribed.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(D) This is a strict liability crime. Voluntary intoxication is no defense to crimes of strict liability because a defense that negates intent is not a defense to a strict liability crime. Thus, (D) is the correct answer and (A) is incorrect. (B) is misleading because voluntary intoxication is an insufficient defense to general intent offenses. (C) is irrelevant.

\section{Answer to Question 18}

(D) Adams is not guilty if he did not intend to achieve the objective of the conspiracy-i.e., to permanently deprive the owner of his property, since Adams thought that Curtis was the owner and that Nelson was improperly keeping the certificates from Curtis. (A) is incorrect because an agreement and overt act are insufficient for conspiracy if Adams did not have the intent to commit larceny. (B), while a correct statement of law, is irrelevant to the required specific intent element. The corrupt motive doctrine is a minority view requiring conspirators to know that their objective is illegal. However, $(\mathrm{C})$ is inapplicable to these facts since Adams had no intent to commit larceny.

\section{Answer to Question 19}

(C) The crime of conspiracy requires that each conspirator intend to achieve an unlawful goal. If the jury believes Bennett, he must be found not guilty because he did not intend to achieve an unlawful goal. (A) is therefore incorrect. (D) is incorrect because Bennett's act of prevention would not have excused the conspiracy if he had the proper mental state. (Note: The Model Penal Code recognizes such a defense.) (B) is incorrect because the privilege to apprehend criminals is not in issue here. 

\section{Answer to Question 20}

(D) If the jury believes both Adams and Bennett, neither could be guilty of conspiracy because of absence of intent. Therefore, Curtis could not be guilty of conspiracy at common law because there was never an agreement to achieve an unlawful purpose. (A) is wrong because there was never an agreement between two or more persons. (B) is incorrect because intent is but one element of conspiracy-there must also be an agreement. (C) is a nonsensical statement.

\section{Answer to Question 21}

(A) Case squib (A) is the most applicable. Case squib (A) illustrates that the state of mind required for larceny is satisfied when the defendant intends to deal with the property in a manner that involves a substantial risk of loss to the owner, such as intending to sell the property back to the owner or hold it until a reward is offered. In this question, Davis used the tools to break open a safe. While he probably never intended to keep the tools, he also never intended to return them either-he did not care whether the hardware store ever got the tools back. Thus, the charge of larceny here is based on an intent to deal with the property in a manner that involves a high risk of loss to the owner, just as in squib (A). Squib (B) is not as applicable because the decisive element there was the defendants' intent only to borrow the car and to return it within a reasonable time. Squibs (C) and (D) are inapplicable because they involved a taking by means of false representations, which is not the case here.

\section{Answer to Question 22}

(D) Squib (D) is the most applicable precedent. That squib establishes that the "trespassory" aspect of the taking is satisfied when the victim consents to defendant's taking possession of the property only as a result of defendant's misrepresentations. In this question, Vincent transferred possession of the $\$ 500$ as a result of the false representations of Smith. Squib (C) is not applicable because it establishes that one obtaining title to property as a result of false representations is not guilty of larceny. Here, Vincent only transferred possession of the $\$ 500$-he was expecting to receive a certificate of deposit for it.

\section{Answer to Question 23}

(B) Squib (B) is most applicable because it establishes that an intent to borrow another's property without permission for a short period of time is not sufficient for common law larceny. Here, Jones took the statuary with the intent to return it within a day or two. Despite his vindictive motive, Jones would not be liable for larceny if the jury decides that he did not intend to keep it for an unreasonable length of time. Regardless of the verdict, squib $(B)$ is the most applicable precedent. Squib (A) is not applicable because the defendants in that case were not planning to return the dog until the owner offered a reward, which is not the case here.

\section{Answer to Question 24}

(A) Squib (A) is most applicable. That case squib establishes that an intent to deal with another's property in any manner that creates a substantial risk of loss of the property is a sufficient intent for larceny. Here, Harris's conduct in pawning the property after taking it from the owner created a substantial risk of loss to the owner-enough to make Harris liable for larceny. Squib (B) is inappropriate because pawning the property negates any intent to return it. Squibs (C) and (D) are inapplicable because there were no misrepresentations in this case. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

\section{Answer to Question 25}

(C) Case squib (C) is most applicable because it establishes that common law larceny does not apply in the fact situation here. In squib (C), the decisive element is that the victim, Will, gave the cash to the defendant with the intent that he keep it (i.e., with the intent to convey title to the cash to defendant in exchange for possession of the apartment). As a result, defendant was not guilty of common law larceny of the cash because more than possession was transferred. Similarly, here Mark passed title to the money to Allison based on Allison's false representations. Squib (C) is therefore more applicable than squib (D) because (C) establishes that common law larceny does not apply in this case.

\section{Answer to Question 26}

(B) It seems clear from the facts that Ted has killed in self-defense. Even if striking Howard with the lamp were seen as the use of deadly force, it was necessary in response to the latter's use of deadly force. (A) is simply irrelevant. (C) might have been relevant to a defense for Howard if he had killed Ted, but it is irrelevant to the facts of this case. (D) is a misstatement of law.

\section{Answer to Question 27}

(B) Battery is a general intent crime that may be satisfied by a showing of recklessness or criminal negligence. (B) involves facts that are most clearly inconsistent with the defendant having any mental state whatever. Alternatively, (B) is to be preferred because it most clearly indicates that there was not a willed act, since convulsive acts are not considered to be voluntary. Even while in a hypnotic state, Defendant's striking Victim was a voluntary physical movement. (A) is therefore incorrect. (C) is wrong because voluntary intoxication is not a defense to crimes requiring recklessness. (D) is inapplicable because, although he was mistaken as to Victim's actions, Defendant willed himself to hit Victim.

\section{Answer to Question 28}

(C) Answer (A) is to be rejected because the request for the attorney means interrogation must cease and not that the attorney be produced immediately. In this case, interrogation had not yet begun. (B) is inapplicable since there is no suggestion that the arrest was unlawful. (D) is accurate but nonsensical. It is the introduction of the statement, not the fingerprints, that is in issue. The best answer is $(\mathrm{C})$, because truly volunteered statements are not the product of custodial interrogation.

\section{Answer to Question 29}

(C) It is clear that the taking was not achieved by the use of force, an element of robbery. (It would be different if Defendant had run down the victim with the intent to appropriate his property.) (A) and (B) are based on mistaken legal premises and are thus incorrect. The Defendant's motive is irrelevant, and larceny does not require a taking from a living person. (D) might be accurate at common law but modern statutes normally include documents as being property subject to larceny and thus, robbery.

\section{Answer to Question 30}

(A) Dan should be found guilty. The problem here is whether Dan caused Tom's death. Dan's act was not only the "but for" cause but also, since the death as it happened was the natural and foreseeable result, the "proximate" cause. The fact that other preexisting conditions contributed to the death does not absolve Dan. Therefore, (D) is incorrect. (B) is irrelevant to whether Dan committed murder. (C) is a misstatement of the facts relating to Tom's "serious" illness. Moreover, an act that hastens an inevitable result is still a legal cause of that result.

\section{Answer to Question 31}

(C) The statute defines assault as "an attempt to commit a battery." Attempts require the specific intent to commit the crime. We are told Edward had no such intent. Hence, $(\mathrm{C})$ is the best answer. Thus, (A) and (B) are incorrect. (D) is incorrect because an assault is an attempt to cause an offensive touching, and thus it would not be necessary for him to actually hit Margaret.

\section{Answer to Question 32}

(D) There is no doubt that Margaret committed a battery. Hence, (C) is to be rejected. The question is whether it was justified. Since she is permitted to use nondeadly force when she reasonably believes such is necessary to avoid the danger of harm from an aggressor and the facts indicate this was her position, the best answer is (D). (A) is incorrect because, even though her conduct was intentional, she has a defense of self-defense. (B) is incorrect because of her justification for the pushing.

\section{Answer to Question 33}

(C) A court, in enforcing a criminal statute, will construe legislative intent in assessing criminal liability. If a statute defines a crime in a way that necessarily involves more than one participant and provides for the liability of only one participant, it is presumed that the legislative intent was to immunize the other participant from liability as an accomplice (e.g., the buyer in an illegal sale of drugs is neither guilty of being an accessory to the sale nor in a conspiracy with the seller). Further, the rule of lenity requires that an ambiguous criminal statute must be strictly construed in favor of the defendant. (A) is wrong because those who provide inducement for a crime that requires two parties are not accessories. Further, Monroe was not an accessory at common law because accessories were not present when the crime was committed. (B) is wrong because Monroe is not the victim; the state is. (D) is wrong because Monroe did assist Professor Smith in violating the statute by offering him the $\$ 50$.

\section{Answer to Question 34}

(C) Answer (A) is wrong because we are told Defendant did not have the requisite intent to steal. (B) is incorrect because Defendant's mistake may have gone to civil law-his right to use self-help in recovering a debt-rather than to the former type of mistake. (D) is to be rejected because of the facts; Defendant did not intend to steal the property of another. (C) is the best answer because Defendant's mistake is as to the coverage of the criminal law and that is not an excuse. 

\section{EVIDENCE QUESTIONS}

Questions 1-2 are based on the following fact situation:

Paula sued for injuries she sustained in a fall in a hotel hallway connecting the lobby of the hotel with a restaurant located in the hotel building. The hallway floor was covered with vinyl tile. The defendants were Horne, owner of the hotel building, and Lee, lessee of the restaurant. The evidence was that the hallway floor had been waxed approximately an hour before Paula slipped on it, and although the wax had dried, there appeared to be excessive dried wax caked on several of the tiles. Horne's defense was that the hallway was a part of the premises leased to Lee over which he retained no control, and Lee denied negligence and alleged contributory negligence.

1. Lee offered to prove by Marks, the restaurant manager, that in the week immediately preceding Paula's fall at least 1,000 people had used the hallway in going to and from the restaurant, and Marks had neither seen anyone fall nor received reports that anyone had fallen. The trial judge should rule this evidence:

(A) Admissible, because it tends to prove that Paula did not use the care exercised by reasonably prudent people.

(B) Admissible, because it tends to prove that Lee was generally careful in maintaining the floor.

(C) Inadmissible, because Marks's testimony is self-serving.

(D) Inadmissible, because it does not bear on the issue of Lee's exercise of due care on this specific occasion.

2. If Paula offered to prove that the day after she fell, Horne had the vinyl tile taken up and replaced with a new floor covering, the trial judge should rule the evidence:

(A) Admissible, because it is relevant to the issue of whether Horne retained control of the hallway. (B) Admissible, because it is relevant in the issue of awareness of the unsafe condition of the hallway at the time of Paula's fall.

(C) Inadmissible, because there was no showing that the new floor covering would be any safer than the old.

(D) Inadmissible, because to admit such would discourage a policy of making repairs to prevent further injury, regardless of fault.

\section{Question 3}

Powers sued Debbs for battery. At trial, Powers's witness, Wilson, testified that Debbs had made an unprovoked attack on Powers.

On cross-examination, Debbs asks Wilson about a false claim that Wilson had once filed on an insurance policy. The question is:

(A) Proper, because the conduct involved untruthfulness.

(B) Proper, provided that the conduct resulted in conviction of Wilson.

(C) Improper, because the impeachment involved a specific instance of misconduct.

(D) Improper, because the claim form would be the best evidence.

\section{Question 4}

In a tort action, Fisher testified against Dawes. Dawes then called Jones, who testified that Fisher had a bad reputation for veracity. Dawes then also called Weld to testify that Fisher once perpetrated a hoax on the police.

Weld's testimony is:

(A) Admissible, because a hoax involves untruthfulness.

(B) Admissible, provided that the hoax resulted in conviction of Fisher. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

(C) Inadmissible, because it is merely cumulative impeachment.

(D) Inadmissible, because it is extrinsic evidence of a specific instance of misconduct.

Questions 5-6 are based on the following fact situation:

Peters sued Davis for $\$ 100,000$ for injuries received in a traffic accident. Davis charges Peters with contributory negligence and alleges that Peters failed to have his lights on at a time when it was dark enough to require them.

5. Davis calls Bystander to testify that Passenger, who was riding in Peters's automobile and who was injured, confided to him at the scene of the accident that "we should have had our lights on." Bystander's testimony is:
(A) Admissible as an admission of a party opponent.
(B) Admissible as a statement against interest.
(C) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.
(D) Inadmissible, because it is opinion.

6. Davis offers to have Bystander testify that he was talking to Witness when he heard the crash and heard Witness, now deceased, exclaim, "That car doesn't have any lights on." Bystander's testimony is:
(A) Admissible as a statement of present sense impression.
(B) Admissible, because Witness is not available to testify.
(C) Inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.
(D) Inadmissible, because of the Dead Man's Statute.

Questions 7-8 are based on the following fact situation:

Owner and his employee, Driver, consult Attorney about a motor vehicle collision resulting in a suit by Litigant against Owner and Driver as joint defendants. Attorney calls Irving, his investigator, into the conference to make notes of what is said, and those present discuss the facts of the collision and Owner's insurance. Owner thereafter files a cross-claim against Driver for indemnity for any damages obtained by Litigant.

7. Litigant calls Driver to testify in Litigant's case-in-chief to admissions made by Owner in the conference. On objection by Owner, the court should rule that Driver's testimony is:
(A) Admissible, because of the presence of persons in the conference other than Attorney and Owner.
(B) Admissible, because Driver is an adverse party in the lawsuit.
(C) Inadmissible, because of the attorney- client privilege.
(D) Inadmissible, because the best evi- dence is Irving's notes of the confer- ence.

8. Driver calls Irving in his defense against the cross-claim. He seeks to have Irving testify to admissions made by Owner in the conference. On objection by Owner, the court should rule Irving's testimony:
(A) Admissible, because the attorney- client privilege does not apply, in suits between those conferring with him, to joint consultations with an attorney.
(B) Admissible, because the attorney- client privilege does not apply to testimony by one who does not stand in a confidential relationship with the person against whom the evidence is offered. (C) Admissible, because the conference was not intended to be confidential, since it concerned anticipated testimony in open court.

(D) Inadmissible, because Owner has not waived the attorney-client privilege.

Questions 9-11 are based on the following fact situation:

Pemberton and three passengers, Able, Baker, and Charley, were injured when their car was struck by a truck owned by Mammoth Corporation and driven by Edwards. Helper, also a Mammoth employee, was riding in the truck. The issues in Pemberton $v$. Mammoth include the negligence of Edwards in driving too fast and in failing to wear glasses, and of Pemberton in failing to yield the right of way.

9. Pemberton's counsel proffers evidence showing that shortly after the accident, Mammoth put a speed governor on the truck involved in the accident. The judge should rule the proffered evidence:

(A) Admissible as an admission of a party.

(B) Admissible as res gestae.

(C) Inadmissible for public policy reasons.

(D) Inadmissible, because it would lead to the drawing of an inference on an inference.

10. Pemberton's counsel seeks to introduce Helper's written statement that Edwards, Mammoth's driver, had left his glasses (required by his operator's license) at the truck stop which they had left five minutes before the accident. The judge should rule the statement admissible only if:

(A) Pemberton first proves that Helper is an agent of Mammoth and that the statement concerned a matter within the scope of his agency. (B) Pemberton produces independent evidence that Edwards was not wearing corrective lenses at the time of the accident.

(C) Helper is shown to be beyond the process of the court and unavailable to testify.

(D) The statement was under oath in affidavit form.

11. Mammoth's counsel seeks to have Sheriff testify that while he was investigating the accident he was told by Pemberton, "This was probably our fault." The judge should rule the proffered evidence:

(A) Admissible as an admission of a party.

(B) Admissible, because it is a statement made to a police officer in the course of an official investigation.

(C) Inadmissible, because it is a mixed conclusion of law and fact.

(D) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

\section{Question 12}

In a contract suit between Terrell and Ward, Ward testified that he recalls having his first conversation with Terrell on January 3. When asked how he remembers the date, he answers, "In the conversation, Terrell referred to a story in that day's newspaper announcing my daughter's engagement." Terrell's counsel moves to strike the reference to the newspaper story.

The judge should:

(A) Grant the motion on the ground that the best evidence rule requires production of the newspaper itself.

(B) Grant the motion, because the reference to the newspaper story does not fit within any established exception to the hearsay rule. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

(C) Deny the motion on the ground that the court may take judicial notice of local newspapers and their contents.

(D) Deny the motion on the ground that a witness may refer to collateral documents without providing the documents themselves.

\section{Question 13}

In Peel's personal injury action, Wilson, a physician who had no previous knowledge of the matter, sat in court and heard all of the evidence about Peel's symptoms and conditions.

Wilson is called to give her opinion whether Peel's injuries are permanent. May Wilson so testify?

(A) Yes, provided she first identifies the data on which her opinion is based.

(B) Yes, because an expert may base her opinion on facts made known to her at the trial.

(C) No, because she has no personal knowledge of Peel's condition.

(D) No, because permanence of injury is an issue to be decided by the jury.

Questions 14-15 are based on the following fact situation:

Rider, a bus passenger, sued Transit Company for injuries to his back from an accident caused by Transit's negligence. Transit denies that Rider received any injury in the accident.

14. Rider's counsel seeks to introduce an affidavit he obtained in preparation for trial from Dr. Bond, who has since died. The affidavit avers that Dr. Bond examined Rider two days after the Transit Company accident and found him suffering from a recently incurred back injury. The judge should rule the affidavit:

(A) Admissible as a statement of present bodily condition made to a physician. (B) Admissible as prior recorded testimony.

(C) Inadmissible, because it is irrelevant.

(D) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

15. Transit Company calls Observer to testify that right after the accident, Rider told him that he had recently suffered a recurrence of an old back injury. The judge should rule Observer's testimony:

(A) Admissible as an admission of a partyopponent.

(B) Admissible as a spontaneous declaration.

(C) Inadmissible, because it is irrelevant.

(D) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

\section{Question 16}

Patty sues Mart Department Store for personal injuries, alleging that while shopping she was knocked to the floor by a merchandise cart being pushed by Handy, a stock clerk, and that as a consequence her back was injured.

Handy testified that Patty fell near the cart but was not struck by it. Thirty minutes after Patty's fall, Handy, in accordance with regular practice at Mart, had filled out a printed form, "Employee's Report of Accident-Mart Department Store," in which he stated that Patty had been leaning over to spank her young child and in so doing had fallen near his cart. Counsel for Mart offers in evidence the report, which had been given him by Handy's supervisor.

The judge should rule the report offered by Mart:

(A) Admissible as res gestae.

(B) Admissible as a business record. (C) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

(D) Inadmissible, because Handy is available as a witness.

\section{Question 17}

Pace sues Def Company for injuries suffered when Pace's car collided with Def Company's truck. Def's general manager prepared a report of the accident at the request of the company's attorney, in preparation for the trial, and delivered the report to the attorney. Pace demands that the report be produced.

Will production of the report be required?
(A) Yes, because business reports are not generally privileged.
(B) No, because it is a privileged communica- tion from client to the attorney.
(C) No, because such reports contain hearsay.
(D) No, because such reports are self-serving.

\section{Question 18}

At the trial of Davis for a murder that occurred in Newtown, the prosecution called Waite, who testified that she saw Davis kill the victim. Davis believed that Waite was 600 miles away in Old Town, engaged in the illegal sale of narcotics, on the day in question. On crossexamination by Davis, Waite was asked whether she had in fact sold narcotics in Old Town on that date. Waite refused to answer on the ground of self-incrimination.

The judge, over the prosecutor's objection, ordered that if Waite did not testify, her direct testimony should be stricken.

The order to testify or have the testimony stricken can best be supported on the basis that:

(A) Waite had not been charged with any crime and, thus, could claim no privilege against self-incrimination. (B) Waite's proper invocation of the privilege prevented adequate cross-examination.

(C) The public interest in allowing an accused to defend himself or herself outweighs the interest of a nonparty witness in the privilege.

(D) The trial record, independent of testimony, does not establish that Waite's answer could incriminate her.

\section{Question 19}

Alex and Sam were arrested for holding up a gas station. They were taken to police headquarters and placed in a room for interrogation. As a police officer addressing both started to give them Miranda warnings prior to the questioning, Alex said, "Look, Sam planned the damned thing and I was dumb enough to go along with it. We robbed the place-what else is there to say?" Sam said nothing. Sam was escorted into another room and a full written confession was then obtained from Alex.

If Sam is brought to trial on an indictment charging him with robbery, the fact that Sam failed to object to Alex's statement and remained silent after Alex had implicated him in the crime should be ruled:

(A) Admissible, because his silence was an implied admission by Sam that he had participated in the crime.

(B) Admissible, because a statement of a participant in a crime is admissible against another participant.

(C) Inadmissible, because under the circumstances there was no duty or responsibility on Sam's part to respond.

(D) Inadmissible, because whatever Alex may have said has no probative value in a trial against Sam.

\section{Question 20}

Pack sued Donlon for slander, alleging that Donlon had publicly accused Pack of being a 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

thief. In his answer, Donlon admitted making the accusation, but alleged that it was a true statement.

At trial, Donlon offers evidence that Pack stole a ring worth $\$ 10,000$ from a jewelry store.

Evidence concerning this theft should be:

(A) Admitted, because specific instances of conduct may be proved when character is directly in issue.

(B) Admitted, because Pack's actions constituted a felony.

(C) Excluded, because character must be shown by reputation or opinion.

(D) Excluded, because its relevance is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

\section{Question 21}

In a suit attacking the validity of a deed executed 15 years ago, Plaintiff alleges mental incompetency of Joe, the grantor, and offers in evidence a properly authenticated affidavit of Harry, Joe's brother. The affidavit, which was executed shortly after the deed, stated that Harry had observed Joe closely over a period of weeks, that Joe had engaged in instances of unusual behavior (which were described), and that Joe's appearance had changed from one of neatness and alertness to one of disorder and absentmindedness.

The judge should rule Harry's affidavit:
(A) Inadmissible as opinion.
(B) Inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.
(C) Admissible as an official document.
(D) Admissible as an ancient document.

\section{Question 22}

Park brought an action against Dan for injuries received in an automobile accident, alleging negligence in that Dan was speeding and inattentive. Park calls White to testify that Dan had a reputation in the community of being a reckless driver and was known as "Daredevil Dan."

White's testimony is:

(A) Admissible as habit evidence.

(B) Admissible, because it tends to prove that Dan was negligent at the time of this collision.

(C) Inadmissible, because Dan has not offered testimony of his own good character.

(D) Inadmissible to show negligence.

\section{Question 23}

In Polk's negligence action against Dell arising out of a multiple-car collision, Witt testified for Polk that Dell went through a red light. On crossexamination, Dell seeks to question Witt about her statement that the light was yellow, made in a deposition that Witt gave in a separate action between Adams and Baker. The transcript of the deposition is self-authenticating.

On proper objection, the court should rule the inquiry:

(A) Admissible for impeachment only.

(B) Admissible as substantive evidence only.

(C) Admissible for impeachment and as substantive evidence.

(D) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception. Questions 24-25 are based on the following fact situation:

Price sued Derrick for injuries Price received in an automobile accident. Price claimed Derrick was negligent in (a) exceeding the posted speed limit of 35 m.p.h., (b) failing to keep a lookout, and (c) crossing the center line.

24. Bystander, Price's eyewitness, testified on cross-examination that Derrick was wearing a green sweater at the time of the accident. Derrick's counsel calls Wilson to testify that Derrick's sweater was blue. Wilson's testimony is:
(A) Admissible as substantive evidence of a material fact.
(B) Admissible as bearing on Bystander's truthfulness and veracity.
(C) Inadmissible, because it has no bear- ing on the capacity of Bystander to observe.
(D) Inadmissible, because it is extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter.

25. Derrick testified in his own behalf that he was going 30 m.p.h. On cross-examination, Price's counsel did not question Derrick with regard to his speed. Subsequently, Price's counsel calls Officer to testify that, in his investigation following the accident, Derrick told him he was driving 40 m.p.h. Officer's testimony is:
(A) Admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.
(B) Admissible as an admission.
(C) Inadmissible, because it lacks a foundation.
(D) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

\section{Question 26}

Drew is charged with the murder of Pitt. The prosecutor introduced testimony of a police officer that Pitt told a priest administering the last rites, "I was stabbed by Drew. Since I am dying, tell him I forgive him." Thereafter, Drew's attorney offers the testimony of Wall that the day before, when Pitt believed he would live, he stated that he had been stabbed by Jack, an old enemy.

The testimony of Wall is:
(A) Admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.
(B) Admissible to impeach the dead declarant.
(C) Inadmissible, because it goes to the ulti- mate issue in the case.
(D) Inadmissible, because irrelevant to any substantive issue in the case.

\section{Question 27}

Post sued Dean for personal injury alleged to have been caused by Dean's negligence. A major issue at trial was whether Post's disability was caused solely by trauma or by a preexisting condition of osteoarthritis.

Post called Dr. Cox, who testified that the disability was caused by trauma. On crossexamination, Dr. Cox testified that a medical textbook entitled Diseases of the Joints was authoritative and that she agreed with the substance of passages from the textbook that she was directed to look at, but that the passages were inapplicable to Post's condition because they dealt with rheumatoid arthritis rather than with the osteoarthritis that Post was alleged to have.

Dean then called his expert, Dr. Freed, who testified that, with reference to the issue being litigated, there is no difference between the two kinds of arthritis. Dean's counsel then asks permission to read to the jury the textbook passages earlier shown to Dr. Cox.

The judge should rule the textbook passages:

(A) Admissible only for the purpose of impeaching Cox. (B) Admissible as substantive evidence if the judge determines that the passages are relevant.

(C) Inadmissible, because they are hearsay not within any exception.

(D) Inadmissible, because Cox contended that they are not relevant to Post's condition.

\section{Question 28}

Pratt sued Danvers for injuries suffered by Pratt when their automobiles collided. At trial, Pratt offers into evidence a properly authenticated letter from Danvers that says, "Your claim seems too high, but, because I might have been a little negligent, I'm prepared to offer you half of what you ask."

The letter is:

(A) Admissible as an admission by a partyopponent.

(B) Admissible as a statement against pecuniary interest.

(C) Inadmissible, because Danvers's statement is lay opinion on a legal issue.

(D) Inadmissible, because Danvers's statement was made in an effort to settle the claim.

\section{Question 29}

Parker sued Dodd over title to an island in a river. Daily variations in the water level were important.

For many years Wells, a commercial fisherman, kept a daily log of the water level at his dock opposite the island in order to forecast fishing conditions. Parker employed Zee, an engineer, to prepare graphs from Wells's log.

Wells was called to testify to the manner in which he kept the log, which had been available for inspection. His testimony should be:

(A) Excluded on a general objection because not admissible for any purpose. (B) Excluded on a specific objection that it calls for hearsay.

(C) Admitted to support the credibility of Wells and Zee as witnesses.

(D) Admitted as part of the foundation for admission of Zee's graphs.

\section{Question 30}

Polk sued DeVore on a written contract. In her case-in-chief, DeVore testified that she withdrew from the contractual arrangement, as the contract permitted, by notifying Polk by means of a letter. She testified that she put the letter in an envelope, with proper postage, addressed to Polk at his place of business, and that she placed it in a United States Post Office mailbox.

In rebuttal, Polk testified that he got his mail each day from a locked post office box and that he had never received any such letter. There was no other evidence relating to receipt of the notice letter.

When the case is ready to go to the jury, the trial judge should:

(A) Withdraw from the jury's consideration the issue of whether Polk received the notice.

(B) Instruct the jury that it may presume that Polk received the notice.

(C) Instruct the jury that it should find that Polk received the notice.

(D) Submit the case to the jury without instruction concerning a presumption of receipt.

\section{Question 31}

Park sued Dent for breach of an oral contract which Dent denied making. Weston testified that he heard Dent make the contract on July 7. Dent discredited Weston, and Park offers evidence of Weston's good reputation for truthfulness. The rehabilitation is most likely to be permitted if the discrediting evidence by Dent was testimony that:

(A) Weston had been promoting highly speculative stocks.

(B) Weston had been Park's college roommate.

(C) Weston had attended a school for mentally retarded children.

(D) Weston had been out of town the whole week of July 4-10.

\section{Question 32}

In a will case, Paula seeks to prove her relationship to the testator Terrence by a statement in a deed of a gift from Terrence, "I transfer to my niece Paula ..." The deed was recorded pursuant to statute in the office of the county recorder and is kept there. Paula calls Recorder, who authenticates an enlarged print photocopy of the deed. The photocopy was made from the microfilm records kept in Recorder's office pursuant to statute.

The photocopy is:

(A) Admissible as a record of a document affecting an interest in property.

(B) Admissible as recorded recollection.

(C) Inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.

(D) Inadmissible as not the best evidence.

\section{Question 33}

Alice was held up at the point of a gun, an unusual revolver with a red-painted barrel, while she was clerking in a neighborhood grocery store. Dennis is charged with armed robbery of Alice.

The prosecutor calls Winthrop to testify that, a week after the robbery of Alice, he was robbed by Dennis with a pistol that had red paint on the barrel. Winthrop's testimony is:

(A) Admissible as establishing an identifying circumstance.

(B) Admissible as showing that Dennis was willing to commit robbery.

(C) Inadmissible, because it is improper character evidence.

(D) Inadmissible, because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

\section{Question 34}

Darden was prosecuted for armed robbery. At trial, Darden testified in his own behalf, denying that he had committed the robbery. On crossexamination, the prosecutor intends to ask Darden whether he had been convicted of burglary six years earlier.

The question concerning the burglary conviction is:

(A) Proper if the court finds that the probative value for impeachment outweighs the prejudice to Darden.

(B) Proper, because the prosecutor is entitled to make this inquiry as a matter of right.

(C) Improper, because burglary does not involve dishonesty or false statement.

(D) Improper, because the conviction must be proved by court record, not by question on cross-examination. 

\section{EVIDENCE ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(D) The testimony of Marks presents a problem of relevance. When evidence that relates to a time, event, or person other than the time, event, or persons directly involved in the controversy being litigated is offered, the relevance of that evidence is suspect. However, such evidence may be relevant if it is probative of the material issue involved, and if such probative value outweighs the risk of confusion or unfair prejudice. Specifically, the evidence being offered here is evidence of the absence of similar accidents. Many courts are reluctant to admit evidence of the absence of similar accidents or complaints to show absence of negligence, or lack of a defect. Thus, (D) correctly concludes that the testimony cannot be admitted to show that, at the time of Paula's injury, Lee was exercising due care. For the same reason, (B) is incorrect in stating that the evidence may be used to show that Lee was generally careful in maintaining the floor. (A) is incorrect because, if this type of evidence cannot be used to show that the defendant was not negligent, then it certainly cannot be used to show that the plaintiff was negligent. (C) is incorrect because the fact that evidence may be self-serving does not render it inadmissible; virtually all evidence is self-serving to its proponent, or else it would not be offered by that party.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(A) The law encourages the repair of defective conditions that cause injury. Thus, evidence of repairs or other precautionary measures made following an injury is inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. However, such evidence may be admissible for other purposes. One such purpose is to show ownership or control, since it is unlikely that a stranger would make repairs. Here, Horne has denied that he had control of the hallway in which the injury occurred. Thus, evidence that he had a new floor covering placed in the hallway is relevant to show that he did in fact have control of the subject premises. This conclusion is accurately reflected in (A). (B) is incorrect because it points to precisely a reason why the evidence might not be admissible $($ i.e., it tries to use the evidence to show that Horne was negligent). (D) is incorrect because proof of ownership or control is, as detailed above, an exception to the general rule that evidence of subsequent repairs is inadmissible. Regarding $(\mathrm{C})$, we have already established that the evidence is admissible to show control. Whether the new floor covering is actually safer than the old will not change this result.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(A) A witness may be interrogated upon cross-examination, in the discretion of the court, with respect to any act of misconduct that is probative of truthfulness, regardless of whether the witness was convicted as a result of the "bad act." Thus, (A) is correct. (B) is incorrect because, although it arrives at the correct conclusion that the question is proper, it incorrectly requires that the misconduct have resulted in a conviction. (C) is incorrect because impeachment may be based on specific acts of misconduct. (D) is incorrect because such specific acts of misconduct can only be elicited on cross-examination of the witness; extrinsic evidence is not permitted.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(D) A witness may be interrogated upon cross-examination, in the discretion of the court, with respect to any act of misconduct that is probative of truthfulness, regardless of whether the witness was convicted as a result of the "bad act." Such specific act of misconduct can only be elicited on cross-examination of the witness. Extrinsic evidence is not permitted. Weld's testimony would constitute extrinsic evidence of a specific instance of misconduct. Thus, (D) is correct. It follows that (A) and (B) are incorrect. (C) is incorrect because there is no rule limiting cumulative impeachment. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(C) Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Bystander's testimony as to Passenger's statement is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein; i.e., that Peters did not have his lights on and was thus contributorily negligent. Therefore, the statement is not admissible unless it comes within one of the hearsay exceptions. (A) is incorrect because Passenger is not a party, and there is no indication either that Peters adopted Passenger's statement or that Peters and Passenger had such a relationship that would render the statement a vicarious admission by Peters. (B) is incorrect because the statement against interest exception requires that the declarant be unavailable as a witness. Passenger does not appear to be unavailable. Also, the statement does not seem to be against the interest of Passenger (although it certainly is against the interest of Peters). (D) is incorrect because the matter is one about which laypersons regularly form opinions.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(A) Witness's statement is hearsay but within the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule. This exception comes into play when a person perceives some event that is not particularly shocking, yet that person nevertheless is moved to comment on what he perceived at the time of receipt of the sense impression or immediately thereafter. Here, the statement conveys what Witness perceived at the time of the accident; thus, it is allowed into evidence as a present sense impression. Because the statement falls within one of the hearsay exceptions, (C) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because, for the present sense impression exception, the declarant's availability is immaterial. (D) is incorrect because a Dead Man's Statute prohibits testimony as to a personal transaction or communication with a decedent when such testimony is offered against the representative or successors in interest of the deceased. This question does not involve a suit against a decedent's estate.

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(C) A communication is confidential, for purposes of the attorney-client privilege, if it was not intended to be disclosed to third persons, other than those to whom disclosure would be in furtherance of the rendition of legal services to the client. Also, where a lawyer acts for two parties, the privilege can be claimed in a suit between either or both of the parties and third persons. Here, Attorney's investigator is someone to whom disclosure was in furtherance of the rendition of legal services. Thus, any statements made in Irving's presence will still be confidential. In addition, the fact that Owner made statements in the presence of a joint client does not deprive those statements of the protection of the attorney-client privilege. For these reasons, (A) is incorrect in holding the privilege inapplicable because of the presence of third persons in the conference. (B) is incorrect because Driver and Owner are both defendants in Litigant's suit, and communications made by joint clients are privileged as against third parties. (D) is incorrect because the best evidence rule does not apply to these facts. According to the rule, in proving the terms of a writing, where the terms are material, the original writing must be produced. Testimony is not offered here to prove the contents of Irving's notes.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(A) Where a lawyer acts for joint clients, no privilege can be invoked in a suit between the two parties, as they could not have desired nor could they have expected confidentiality as between themselves in a joint consultation. There is a suit (a cross-claim) between Owner and Driver. Thus, in this suit, Owner cannot claim the privilege as to statements made during the joint conference. Therefore, (A) is correct. (B) is wrong because where a privilege attaches, the holder can prevent disclosure by anyone. $(\mathrm{C})$ is incorrect because the lack of confidentiality arises from the fact that the two litigants participated in a joint conference, rather than from the fact that the conference related to testimony to be given in open court. (D) reaches the incorrect conclusion that the testimony is inadmissible, because the privilege has not been waived. As explained above, the requisite confidentiality is missing.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(C) Evidence of repairs or other precautionary measures made following an injury is inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. This is because public policy encourages people to make such repairs. Such evidence is admissible for other purposes, e.g., to prove ownership or control. Here, we are told that the issues involve negligence. Thus, the evidence as to the speed governor is being offered to prove culpable conduct or negligence, and therefore is inadmissible. (A) and (B) each incorrectly conclude that the evidence is admissible. (D) makes absolutely no sense.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(A) The statement by Helper is one made by the declarant (Helper) other than while testifying at the trial, offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that Edwards was not wearing his glasses at the time of the accident). This presents a hearsay issue. However, an admission by a party-opponent is not considered hearsay under the Federal Rules. Here, the party-opponent is Mammoth Corporation, while the statement is by an employee of Mammoth. Statements by an agent concerning any matter within the scope of his agency, made during the course of the employment relationship, are not hearsay and are admissible against the principal. Thus, (A) correctly states that the statement is admissible only if Helper is an agent of Mammoth and the statement concerned a matter within the scope of the agency. (B) is incorrect because admissibility of the statement is not dependent on independent corroboration of the truth thereof. (C) is incorrect because unavailability of the declarant is not a prerequisite for an admission of a partyopponent. (D) is incorrect because an admission need not be under oath in order to be admissible.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(A) As detailed in the answer to the preceding question, an admission by a party-opponent is nonhearsay under the Federal Rules. An admission is a statement made or act done that amounts to a prior acknowledgment by one of the parties of a relevant fact. Here, a fact in issue is whether Pemberton failed to yield the right of way. Pemberton's statement to Sheriff acknowledges fault. Thus, the testimony as to the statement is admissible as an admission by a party-opponent of Mammoth's. Because the evidence is not considered hearsay, (D) incorrectly concludes that it $i s$ hearsay. (B) is incorrect because statements made in such a manner may be inadmissible multiple hearsay. (C) is incorrect because the admissibility of the testimony centers on a party's admission of a relevant fact. The declarant's use of the word "fault," which may be a legal conclusion, does not affect the admissibility of the statement.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(D) Pursuant to the best evidence rule, when proving the terms of a writing (where the terms are material), the original writing must be produced. The rule does not apply to writings of minor importance to the matter in controversy. Thus, a witness may refer to collateral documents 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

without providing the documents themselves. Here, the newspaper issue is tangential. As a result, there is no need to produce the newspaper. Therefore, (A) incorrectly concludes that the best evidence rule requires production of the newspaper. (B) is wrong because the newspaper story is not offered to prove the truth of its contents. (C) is incorrect because courts may take judicial notice of the existence of a local newspaper (a matter of common knowledge within the community) but not the contents of articles appearing therein.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(B) An expert's opinion may be based upon one or more of three possible sources of information: (i) facts that he knows from his own observation; (ii) facts presented in evidence at the trial and submitted to the expert; or (iii) facts not in evidence that were supplied to the expert out of court, which facts are of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions on the subject. (B) correctly refers to (ii), above, as a proper source of information for the expert. (A) is incorrect because, where an expert bases her opinion on facts made known to her at the trial, the expert need not disclose the reasons for the opinion on direct examination unless the court orders it. $(C)$ is incorrect because, although personal observation is one of the sources upon which an expert opinion may be based, it is not the only such source. (D) is incorrect because permanence of injury is an issue that requires specialized knowledge to assist the jury.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(D) The statement is inadmissible hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the affidavit is being offered to prove that Rider incurred a recent back injury. Because Dr. Bond is dead, the adverse party is denied the opportunity to cross-examine him and test the veracity of his statement. Furthermore, the statement falls within no recognized exception to the hearsay rule. Thus, (D) is correct. (A) is incorrect because declarations of present bodily condition are statements made contemporaneously with the symptoms. Here, the affidavit was prepared later in contemplation of trial. It does not contain Rider's contemporaneous statements regarding his symptoms, but rather the physician's observation that Rider suffered from a recent back injury. Hence, the statement does not fall within the exception. (B) is incorrect because the former testimony exception requires that the statement be given during formal proceedings and under oath by a witness subject to cross-examination. (C) is incorrect because the statement relates to a time, event, or person in controversy. Whether Rider's back injury was an old or a recent injury is such a matter in controversy. Hence, the statement is relevant.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(A) An admission by a party-opponent is considered nonhearsay under the Federal Rules. An admission is a statement that amounts to a prior acknowledgment by one of the parties to an action of one of the relevant facts. If the party said or did something inconsistent with his contentions at trial, the law regards him as estopped from preventing its admission into evidence. (A) is correct because Rider's statement that his back injury was a recurrence of an old injury is inconsistent with his assertion that the injury resulted from the recent accident. (B) is wrong because a spontaneous declaration (or "excited utterance") must concern the immediate facts of a startling occurrence. Rider's statement does not refer to the accident itself. Nor is it clear from the facts that the statement was made under the stress of the excitement. (C) is wrong because the statement relates to a time, event, or person in controversy (i.e., whether Rider's back injury resulted from Transit Company's negligence). Hence, it is relevant. (D) is wrong because (as noted in the discussion of option (A), above) an admission by a party-opponent is nonhearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(C) The report is hearsay, as it is a statement, not made by the declarant while testifying at the trial, offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Thus, the report is inadmissible unless it comes within a hearsay exception. The only applicable exception is the business records exception, under which a writing or record made as a memorandum of any act, transaction, occurrence, or event is admissible as proof of such act, etc., if made in the regular course of a business, and if it was the regular course of such business to make it at the time of the act, or within a reasonable time thereafter. Many courts exclude self-serving employee accident reports that are prepared primarily for litigation by someone with a strong motive to misrepresent. Under the Federal Rules, courts have discretion to exclude a business record if the source of information indicates a lack of trustworthiness. The report at issue was prepared primarily for litigation purposes by Handy, who had a strong motive to misrepresent the facts. Therefore, the report is sufficiently lacking in trustworthiness so as to not qualify for admission as a business record. Because the report is inadmissible, (A) and (B) are incorrect for concluding that it is admissible. (D) is incorrect because unavailability is not germane to the business records exception.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(B) Communications between attorney and client, made during professional consultation, are privileged from disclosure. A business report prepared as a communication from client to attorney is privileged. Here, Def's general manager prepared the report at the request of the company's attorney. This report constitutes a privileged, confidential communication between a client (Def Company) and its attorney. Therefore, production of the report will not be required. (A) is incorrect because the facts indicate that this particular business report is of a privileged nature. $(\mathrm{C})$ and (D) are wrong because the fact that a report contains hearsay or is self-serving does not prevent its discovery by the opponent.

\section{Answer to Question 18}

(B) Waite's invocation of the privilege meant that Davis could not cross-examine her on a critical issue in the case. If Waite actually was in Old Town, she could not have witnessed the murder, and her testimony would be impeached. Because she cannot be adequately cross-examined on this matter, her testimony should be stricken in its entirety. (A) is wrong because it is not necessary for a person to have been charged with a crime in order to claim a privilege against selfincrimination. (C) is wrong because a non-party's privileges are not outweighed by the rights of the accused. (D) is wrong because it is not necessary for one claiming a privilege against selfincrimination to establish that she would actually be self-incriminated by her testimony.

\section{Answer to Question 19}

(C) Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a witness cannot be compelled to testify against himself. A prosecutor may not comment on a defendant's silence after being arrested and receiving Miranda warnings. The warnings carry an implicit assurance that silence will carry no penalty. Thus, Sam's silence after Alex's incriminating statement is inadmissible against Sam and (C) is correct. It follows that (A) is incorrect. The self-incrimination privilege negates the "adoptive admission" doctrine, and failure to reply to an accusation or statement 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

made by police in a criminal case can almost never be used as an implied admission of a criminal act. (B) is wrong because the statement is overbroad, and because the issue of admissibility involves Sam's silence (which is protected by the Fifth Amendment) rather than Alex's confession. (D) is an incorrect statement of fact. Alex's statement relates to a time, person, or event in controversy, and thus is relevant and obviously has probative value. However, the issue of admissibility in this question involves Sam's silence and not Alex's statement. Thus, option (D) is unresponsive to the call of the question.

\section{Answer to Question 20}

(A) Evidence concerning the theft should be admitted because specific instances of conduct may be proved when character is directly in issue. Although character evidence, including evidence of specific acts, is generally inadmissible in a civil case, there is an exception where character is directly in issue. In defamation cases, character is always in issue, and evidence is admissible on the trait in question. Here, the issue is whether Pack is a thief. Evidence of acts of theft by Pack are admissible. (B) is wrong because whether the act is a felony is only important if it is offered as a prior conviction to attack the character for truthfulness of a testifying witness. Any act of theft, felony or misdemeanor, would be admissible here to show that Pack is a thief; it is not being offered for impeachment purposes. (C) is incorrect because, under the Federal Rules, any of the types of character evidence (reputation, opinion, or specific acts) may be used to prove character when character is directly in issue. (D) is wrong because the evidence is central to the ultimate issue in the case-the truth of Donlon's statement. Its relevance could not be greater and could not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

\section{Answer to Question 21}

(B) Harry's affidavit is inadmissible. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the affidavit is an out-of-court statement Plaintiff seeks to introduce to prove that Joe was incompetent when he conveyed the property. Hence, it is hearsay. The affidavit does not fall within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. Hence, (B) is correct. (A) is wrong because opinion testimony by lay witnesses is admissible when: (i) it is rationally based on the perception of the witness; and (ii) it is helpful to a clear understanding of testimony or to the determination of a fact in issue. Opinions of laypersons as to the general appearance or condition of a person are generally admissible. The problem here does not involve "opinion," but rather the fact that the affidavit is hearsay. (C) is wrong because the affidavit does not qualify as an official document. The official records exception to the hearsay rule covers records, reports, statements, or data compilations of public offices and agencies made by, and within the scope of duty of, the public employee. Harry and his affidavit have no such official standing. (D) is wrong because the affidavit is 15 years old, and the Federal Rules of Evidence require that a document be at least 20 years old to qualify as an "ancient document." (It should also be noted that statements affecting an interest in property are not subject to the 20 -year rule. However, the affidavit is not a deed, a will, or a document that otherwise disposes of property. Therefore, it does not qualify under the exception.)

\section{Answer to Question 22}

(D) White's testimony is inadmissible to show negligence. Evidence of character to prove the conduct of a person in the litigated event is generally not admissible in civil cases, because the slight probative value of character is outweighed by the danger of prejudice, the possible distraction of the jury from the main question in issue, and the possible waste of time required by examination of collateral issues. There is an exception to this general rule when a person's character itself is one of the issues in the case. Here, Dan's character is not in issue. Thus, the general rule applies, and (D) is correct. (A) is incorrect because habit describes one's regular response to a specific set of circumstances. Here, however, what is involved is character evidence rather than habit evidence. Character describes one's disposition in respect to general traits (i.e., Dan's reputation in the community as a reckless driver). (B) is wrong because reputation evidence in civil cases is admitted only for the purpose of proving character. Negligence of Dan on a particular occasion does not raise character issues. (C) is wrong because it applies the general rule for criminal cases, and the case in question is a civil one.

\section{Answer to Question 23}

(C) Under Federal Rule 801(d)(1), Witt's statement made in the earlier deposition is considered nonhearsay as a prior inconsistent statement made by a witness while testifying under oath at some prior proceeding, and thus is admissible as substantive proof. It can be admitted for impeachment purposes so long as a proper foundation is laid. Federal Rule 613 requires that the witness must be first examined "so as to give him an opportunity to explain or deny" the allegedly inconsistent statement unless "the interests of justice otherwise require." (A) is wrong because this was a former statement made under oath, is considered not to be hearsay, and is admissible as substantive proof. (B) is wrong because so long as a proper foundation is laid, it can be introduced for impeachment purposes as well. (D) is wrong because it is not hearsay.

\section{Answer to Question 24}

(D) Where a witness makes a statement not directly relevant to the issues in the case, the opponent is barred from proving the statement untrue either by extrinsic contradictory facts or by a prior inconsistent statement. The color of the sweater worn by Derrick is collateral to the issues in this case. Thus, allowing testimony contradicting Bystander's testimony on this matter would raise the possibility of unfair surprise, confusion of issues, and inefficient use of the court's time. For these reasons, Wilson's testimony is inadmissible. (A) is wrong because nothing in the facts indicates that the color of Derrick's sweater is of consequence to the action. (B) and (C) are wrong because even if the evidence has some bearing on the witness's credibility, it is excluded because of possible confusion of issues or waste of time.

\section{Answer to Question 25}

(B) The statement made by Derrick to Officer is an admission by a party-opponent (i.e., a statement that amounts to a prior acknowledgment by a party of one of the relevant facts). We are told that the rate of speed at which Derrick was traveling is in issue. Thus, Derrick's statement that he was driving 40 m.p.h. comes in as an admission. (D) is wrong because, under the Federal Rules, an admission is not hearsay. (A) is wrong because an admission is admissible whether or not it discredits later testimony. (C) is wrong because no foundation is necessary for the admission into evidence of an admission by a party-opponent.

\section{Answer to Question 26}

(B) Where an out-of-court statement is admitted into evidence under one of the exceptions to the sible if the declarant had testified. The testimony of Wall is admissible to show that Pitt made a statement that was inconsistent with the statement related by the police officer. (A) is incorrect because impeachment evidence is excluded from the hearsay rule. (C) refers to the traditional 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

rule prohibiting expert witnesses from expressing opinions on the ultimate issue in the case. This rule has been repudiated by the Federal Rules. Also, this case does not involve expert testimony. In addition, the testimony does not relate an opinion. For these reasons, (C) is incorrect. (D) is wrong because Pitt's credibility is crucial to Drew's culpability.

\section{Answer to Question 27}

(B) The Federal Rules allow for substantive admissibility of learned treatises, if such treatises are called to the attention of the expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by her during direct examination and they are established as reliable authority by the testimony or admission of the witness, or by other expert testimony, or by judicial notice. This is an exception to the hearsay rule. Here, the medical textbook was called to the attention of Dr. Cox on cross-examination, and she testified that it was authoritative. Thus, the passages from the textbook are admissible as substantive evidence. It logically follows that (A) and (C) are incorrect. (D) is incorrect because it is not Dr. Cox's job to determine the relevancy of proffered evidence.

\section{Answer to Question 28}

(D) Evidence of compromises or offers to compromise a claim disputed as to either liability or damages is inadmissible to prove liability for or invalidity of a claim. Also, any conduct or statement made in the course of negotiating a compromise is inadmissible. It follows that (A) and (B) are incorrect. (C) is incorrect because, were it not for the rule excluding offers of compromise, the statement would be an admission of a party-opponent. Such an admission can be in the form of an opinion.

\section{Answer to Question 29}

(D) Zee's graphs are demonstrative evidence, offered to illustrate the daily variations in water level at issue here. Because the graphs are reproductions of the data contained in Wells's log, Wells's testimony regarding the compilation of the log is necessary to determine whether the graphs are based on a foundation strong enough to justify their admission into evidence. It follows that (A) is incorrect. (B) is incorrect because this is not hearsay. Wells is going to testify to the manner in which he kept the log, not to an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. (C) is incorrect because, generally, credibility may not be bolstered until it has been impeached.

\section{Answer to Question 30}

(D) A letter shown to have been properly addressed, stamped, and mailed is presumed to have been delivered in the due course of mail. Under the Federal Rules, such a presumption is overcome when the party against whom it is directed produces sufficient evidence contradicting the presumed fact. Here, DeVore's testimony raises a presumption of due delivery of the notice letter. However, Polk, by his testimnny bas nradinen. anninh avi Amante the jury must determine questions of fact, such as whether Polk received the notice. $(B)$ is incorrect because, as explained above, there is no longer a presumption that Polk received the notice. (C) is incorrect because it goes even further than to call for a presumption. Rather, it calls for a "conclusive" presumption, which cannot be rebutted by contrary evidence. Such a presumption runs afoul of the Federal Rules, which permit a presumption to be rebutted. 

\section{Answer to Question 31}

(D) A witness's good reputation for truth and veracity may be shown after attack. However, only under certain circumstances will it be proper. (A) is not correct because selling speculative stocks does not need the response of good reputation for truth. (B) is not correct because good reputation for truth and veracity does not refute bias. (C) is not correct since attending a school for the mentally retarded does not go to credibility. (D) is a fundamental attack going to the credibility of Weston's entire testimony. It is thus the best answer.

\section{Answer to Question 32}

(A), (C) (A) and (C) were both given credit by the examiners. (B) is wrong because for past recollection recorded there must be a record made at or near the event by someone with firsthand knowledge who has no present recollection but who can say it was accurate when written. That is not present here. (D) is wrong because the best evidence rule requires the production of the original unless it is accounted for. Photocopies would be admissible, absent a genuine dispute about the authenticity of the original or other unfairness. Either (A) or (C) could be correct depending upon interpretation. This is a document affecting an interest in property. Statements in documents affecting an interest in property are admissible if they are "relevant to the purpose of the document." If one interprets the statement that the recipient of the deed of gift is related to the donor to be "relevant to the purpose of the document," then (A) would be correct. If not, then (C) would be correct.

\section{Answer to Question 33}

(A) Other crimes or wrongs are not generally admissible. They may be shown, however, to prove identity (among a few other relevant things). Other crimes are admissible on identity only when they are highly individual and amount to a "signature." Red paint on a gun is individual enough to qualify. Thus, (A) is right and (D) is wrong. (B) is an incorrect theory. Having a red gun does not show anything about the defendant's willingness to commit a crime. (C) is wrong, too. This is not character evidence.

\section{Answer to Question 34}

(A) The Federal Rules allow impeachment by: (i) any felony conviction, if the trial judge decides that the probative value of the conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect; and (ii) conviction of any other crime requiring proof or admission of an act of dishonesty or false statement. The prior conviction may be shown either by cross-examination of the witness or by introducing a record of the judgment. It follows that (D) is incorrect. (C) is incorrect because impeachment may be accomplished by showing any felony conviction (if the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect), not just by showing conviction of crimes involving dishonesty or false statement. (B) is incorrect because it fails to account for the need to find that the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect. 

\section{REAL PROPERTY QUESTIONS}

Questions 1-3 are based on the following fact situation:

Sue owned a five-acre tract of land, one acre of which had previously been owned by Opal, but to which Sue had acquired title by adverse possession. Sue contracted to convey the full five-acre tract to Peg, but the contract did not specify the quality of title Sue would convey.

1. Suppose Peg pays the purchase price and accepts a deed. Subsequently, Sue's title to the one acre proves inadequate and Opal ejects Peg from that acre. Peg sues Sue for damages. Which of the following statements applies most accurately to the determination of Peg's rights?
(A) Sue's deed was fraudulent.
(B) The terms of the deed control Sue's liability.
(C) The only remedy available for breach of warranty of title is rescission.
(D) Peg's rights are based on the implied covenants that the title conveyed shall be marketable.

2. Suppose Sue's contract had called for the conveyance of "a good and marketable title." Pursuant to that contract, Peg paid the purchase price and accepted a deed from Sue containing no covenants of title. Sue's title to the one acre subsequently proved defective and Peg was ejected by Opal. Peg sued Sue. Which of the following results is most likely?
(A) Peg will win, because Sue's deed was fraudulent.
(B) Peg will win, because the terms of the deed control Sue's liability.
(C) Sue will win, because the terms of the deed control her liability.
(D) Sue will win, because the deed incor- porates the terms of the contract.

3. Suppose that before closing, the house on the property had been totally destroyed by fire. In determining the rights of Sue and Peg, the court would most likely consider the doctrine of equitable:
(A) Marshaling.
(B) Sequestration.
(C) Subrogation.
(D) Conversion.

\section{Question 4}

Owens contracted to sell a tract of land, Overlea, to Painter by general warranty deed. However, at the closing Painter did not carefully examine the deed and accepted a quitclaim deed without covenants of title. Painter later attempted to sell Overlea to Thompson, who refused to perform because Owens had conveyed an easement for a highway across Overlea before Painter bought the property.

Painter sued Owens for damages. Which of the following arguments will most likely succeed in Owens's defense?
(A) The existence of the easement does not violate the contract.
(B) The mere existence of an easement that is not being used does not give rise to a cause of action.
(C) Painter's cause of action must be based on the deed and not on the contract.
(D) The proper remedy is rescission of the deed.

\section{Question 5}

Lord leased a warehouse building and the lot on which it stood to Taylor for a term of 10 years. The lease contained a clause prohibiting Taylor from subletting his interest.

Can Taylor assign his interest under the lease? 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}
(A) Yes, because restraints on alienation of land are strictly construed.
(B) Yes, because disabling restraints on alien- ation are invalid.
(C) No, because the term "subletting" includes "assignment" when the term is employed in a lease.
(D) No, because even in the absence of an express prohibition on assignment, a tenant may not assign without the landlord's permission.

\section{Question 6}

The following facts concern a tract of land in a state which follows general law. Each instrument is in proper form, recorded, marital property rights were waived when necessary, and each person named was adult and competent at the time of the named transaction.

1. In 1940, Oleg, the owner, conveyed his interest in fee simple "to my brothers Bob and Bill, their heirs and assigns as joint tenants with right of survivorship."

2. In 1950 Bob died, devising his interest to his only child, "Charles, for life, and then to Charles's son, Sam, for life, and then to Sam's children, their heirs and assigns."

3. In 1970 Bill died, devising his interest "to my friend, Frank, his heirs and assigns."

4. In 1972 Frank conveyed by quitclaim deed "to Paul, his heirs and assigns, whatever right, title, and interest I own."

Paul has never married. Paul has contracted to convey marketable record title in the land to Patrick. Can Paul do so?

(A) Yes, without joinder of any other person in the conveyance.

(B) Yes, if Charles, Sam, and Sam's only child (Gene, aged 25) will join in the conveyance. (C) No, regardless of who joins in the conveyance, because Sam may have additional children whose interests cannot be defeated.

(D) No, regardless of who joins in the conveyance, because a title acquired by quitclaim deed is impliedly unmarketable.

Questions 7-8 are based on the following fact situation:

Oscar, the owner in fee simple, laid out a subdivision of 325 lots on 150 acres of land. He obtained governmental approval (as required by applicable ordinances) and, between 1968 and 1970 , he sold 140 of the lots, inserting in each of the 140 deeds the following provision:

The Grantee, for himself and his heirs, assigns and successors, covenants and agrees that the premises conveyed herein shall have erected thereon one singlefamily dwelling and that no other structure (other than a detached garage, normally incident to a single-family dwelling) shall be erected or maintained; and, further, that no use shall ever be made or permitted to be made other than occupancy by a single family for residential purposes only.

Because of difficulty encountered in selling the remaining lots for single-family use, in January 1971, Oscar advertised the remaining lots with prominent emphasis: "These lots are not subject to any restrictions and purchasers will find them adaptable to a wide range of uses."

7. Payne had purchased one of the 140 lots and brought suit against Oscar to establish that the remaining 185 lots, as well as the 140 sold previously, can be used only for residential purposes by single families. Assuming that procedural requirements have been met, to permit adjudication of the issue Payne has tendered, which of the following is the most appropriate comment? (A) Oscar should win because the provision binds only the grantee.

(B) The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.

(C) The outcome turns on whether there are sufficient land areas devoted to multiple family uses within the municipality to afford reasonable opportunity for all economic classes to move into the area so as to satisfy the standards of equal protection of the law.

(D) Payne should win under an application of the doctrine, which requires construction of deeds, to resolve any doubt against the grantor.

8. Suppose that Oscar sold 50 lots during 1971 without inserting in the deeds any provisions relating to structures or uses. Doyle purchased one of the 50 lots and proposes to erect a service station and to conduct a retail business for the sale of gasoline, etc.

Pringle purchased a lot from Boyer. Boyer had purchased from Oscar in 1968 and the deed had the provision that is quoted in the fact situation.

Pringle brings suit to prevent Doyle from erecting the service station and from conducting a retail business.

In the litigation between Pringle and Doyle, which of the following constitutes the best defense for Doyle?

(A) Oscar's difficulty in selling with provisions relating to use establishes a change in circumstances which renders any restrictions which may once have existed unenforceable.

(B) Enforcement of the restriction, in view of the change of circumstances, would be an unreasonable restraint on alienation. (C) Since the proof (as stated) does not establish a danger of monetary loss to Pringle, Pringle has failed to establish one of the necessary elements in a cause of action to prevent Doyle from using his lot for business purposes.

(D) The facts do not establish a common building or development scheme for the entire subdivision.

\section{Question 9}

Odum owned Brightacre (a tract of land) in fee simple. He conveyed it "to Pike, his heirs and assigns; but if Farley shall be living 30 years from the date of this deed, then to Farley, his heirs and assigns."

The limitation "to Farley, his heirs and assigns" is:
(A) Valid, because Farley's interest is a rever- sion.
(B) Valid, because the interest will vest, if at all, within a life in being.
(C) Valid, because Farley's interest is vested subject to divestment.
(D) Invalid.

Questions 10-11 are based on the following fact situation:

Trease owned Hilltop in fee simple. By his will, he devised as follows: "Hilltop to such of my grandchildren who shall reach the age of 21 ; and by this provision I intend to include all grandchildren whenever born." At the time of his death, Trease had three children and two grandchildren.

10. Courts hold such a devise valid under the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. What is the best explanation of that determination?
(A) All of Trease's children would be measuring lives.
(B) The rule of convenience closes the class of beneficiaries when any grand- child reaches the age of 21 . 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

(C) There is a presumption that Trease intended to include only those grandchildren born prior to his death.

(D) There is a subsidiary rule of construction that dispositive instruments are to be interpreted so as to uphold interests rather than to invalidate them under the Rule Against Perpetuities.

11. Which of the following additions to or changes in the facts of the preceding question would produce a violation of the common law Rule Against Perpetuities?
(A) A posthumous child was born to Trease.
(B) Trease's will expressed the intention to include all afterborn grandchildren in the gift.
(C) The instrument was an inter vivos conveyance rather than a will.
(D) Trease had no grandchildren living at the time of his death.

\section{Question 12}

Assume for the purposes of this question that you are counsel to the state legislative committee that is responsible for real estate laws in your state. The committee wants you to draft a statute, governing the recording of deeds, that fixes priorities of title, as reflected on the public record, as definitely as possible.

Which of the following, divorced from other policy considerations, would best accomplish this particular result?
(A) Eliminate the requirement of witnesses to deeds.
(B) Make time of recording the controlling factor.
(C) Make irrebuttable the declarations in the deeds that valuable consideration was paid.
(D) Make the protection of bona fide purchas- ers the controlling factor.

Questions 13-15 are based on the following fact situation:

Owen held in fee simple Farmdale, a large tract of vacant land. The state wherein Farmdale is situated has a statute which provides, in substance, that unless the conveyance is recorded, every deed or other conveyance of an interest in land is void as to a subsequent purchaser who pays value without notice of such conveyance. The following transactions occurred in the order given.

First: Owen conveyed Farmdale, for a fair price, to Allred by general warranty deed. Allred did not immediately record.

Second: Owen executed a mortgage to secure repayment of a loan concurrently made to Owen by Leon. Leon had no notice of the prior conveyance to Allred and promptly recorded the mortgage.

Third: Owen, by general warranty deed, gratuitously conveyed to Niece, who promptly recorded the deed.

Fourth: Allred recorded his deed from Owen.

Fifth: $\quad$ Niece, by general warranty deed, conveyed Farmdale to Barrett. Barrett had no actual notice of any of the prior transactions, paid full value, and promptly recorded the deed.

13. Asserting that his title was held free of any claim by Barrett, Allred instituted suit against Barrett to quiet title to Farmdale. If Barrett prevails, it will be because:
(A) Allred's prior recorded deed is deemed to be outside Barrett's chain of title.
(B) Barrett's grantor, Niece, recorded before Allred.
(C) As between two warranty deeds, the later one controls.
(D) Barrett's grantor, Niece, had no notice of Allred's rights. 14. Asserting that his title was held free of any claim by Leon, Allred instituted suit against Leon to quiet title to Farmdale. Judgment should be for:

(A) Allred, because Leon is deemed not to have paid value.

(B) Allred, because a mortgagee is not a subsequent purchaser within the meaning of the statute mentioned.

(C) Leon, because he recorded before Allred.

(D) Leon, because he advanced money without notice of Allred's rights.

15. Assume for this question only that Niece had not conveyed to Barrett. After Allred recorded his deed from Owen, Allred, asserting that Allred's title was held free of any claim by Niece, instituted suit against Niece to recover title to Farmdale. Judgment should be for:

(A) Niece, because she had no notice of Allred's rights when she accepted the deed from Owen.

(B) Niece, because she recorded her deed before Allred recorded his.

(C) Allred, because Niece was not a bona fide purchaser who paid value.

(D) Allred, because he had paid value for Farmdale and had no actual or constructive notice of the deed to Niece.

Questions 16-17 are based on the following fact situation:

Ogden was the fee simple owner of three adjoining vacant lots fronting on a common street in a primarily residential section of a city which had no zoning laws. The lots were identified as Lots 1, 2, and 3. Ogden conveyed Lot 1 to Akers and Lot 2 to Bell. Ogden retained Lot 3, which consisted of three acres of woodland. Bell, whose lot was between the other two, built a house on his lot. Bell's house included a large window on the side facing Lot 3 . The window provided a beautiful view from Bell's living room, thereby adding value to Bell's house.

Akers erected a house on his lot. Ogden made no complaint to either Akers or Bell concerning the houses they built. After both Akers and Bell had completed their houses, the two of them agreed to and did build a common driveway running from the street to the rear of their respective lots. The driveway was built on the line between the two houses so that one-half of the way was located on each lot. Akers and Bell exchanged right-of-way deeds by which each of them conveyed to the other, his heirs and assigns, an easement to continue the right of way. Both deeds were properly recorded.

After Akers and Bell had lived in their respective houses for 30 years, a new public street was built bordering on the rear of Lots 1, 2, and 3 . Akers informed Bell that, since the new street removed the need for their common driveway, he considered the right-of-way terminated; therefore, he intended to discontinue its use and expected Bell to do the same. At about the same time, Ogden began the erection of a six-story apartment house on Lot 3 . If the apartment house is completed, it will block the view from Bell's window and will substantially reduce the value of Bell's lot.

16. In an action brought by Bell to enjoin Akers from interfering with Bell's continued use of the common driveway between the two lots, the decision should be for:

(A) Akers, because the termination of the necessity for the easement terminated the easement.

(B) Akers, because the continuation of the easement after the change of circumstances would adversely affect the marketability of both lots without adding any commensurate value to either. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

(C) Bell, because an incorporeal hereditament lies in grant and cannot be terminated without a writing.

(D) Bell, because the removal of the need for the easement created by express grant does not affect the right to the easement.

17. In an action brought by Bell to enjoin Ogden from erecting the apartment building in such a way as to obstruct the view from Bell's living room window, the decision should be for:

(A) Bell, because Ogden's proposed building would be an obstruction of Bell's natural right to an easement for light and air.

(B) Bell, because Bell was misled by Ogden's failure to complain when Bell was building his house.

(C) Ogden if, but only if, it can be shown that Ogden's intention to erect such a building was made known to Bell at or prior to the time of Ogden's conveyance to Bell.

(D) Ogden, because Bell has no easement for light, air, or view.

\section{Question 18}

Morgan conveyed Greenacre, her one-family residence, to "Perez for life, remainder to

Rowan, her heirs and assigns, subject, however, to First Bank's mortgage thereon." There was an unpaid balance on the mortgage of $\$ 10,000$, which is payable in $\$ 1,000$ annual installments plus interest at $6 \%$ on the unpaid balance, with the next payment due on July 1 . Perez is now occupying Greenacre. The reasonable rental value of the property exceeds the sum necessary to meet all current charges. There is no applicable statute.

Under the rules governing contributions between life tenants and remaindermen, how should the burden for payment be allocated? (A) Rowan must pay the principal payment, but Perez must pay the interest to First Bank.

(B) Rowan must pay both the principal and interest payments to First Bank.

(C) Perez must pay both the principal and interest payments to First Bank.

(D) Perez must pay the principal payment, but Rowan must pay the interest to First Bank.

\section{Question 19}

Anders conveyed her only parcel of land to Burton by a duly executed and delivered warranty deed, which provided:

To have and to hold the described tract of land in fee simple, subject to the understanding that within one year from the date of the instrument said grantee shall construct and thereafter maintain and operate on said premises a public health center.

The grantee, Burton, constructed a public health center on the tract within the time specified and operated it for five years. At the end of this period, Burton converted the structure into a senior citizens' recreational facility. It is considered by all parties in interest that a senior citizens' recreational facility is not a public health center.

In an appropriate action, Anders seeks a declaration that the change in the use of the facility has caused the land and structure to revert to her. In this action, Anders should:

(A) Win, because the language of the deed created a determinable fee, which leaves a possibility of reverter in the grantor.

(B) Win, because the language of the deed created a fee subject to condition subsequent, which leaves a right of entry or power of termination in the grantor. (C) Lose, because the language of the deed created only a contractual obligation and did not provide for retention of property interest by the grantor.

(D) Lose, because an equitable charge is enforceable only in equity.

\section{Question 20}

Homer conveyed his home to his wife Wanda, for life, remainder to his daughter, Dixie. There was a $\$ 20,000$ mortgage on the home, requiring monthly payment covering interest to date plus a portion of the principal.

Which of the following statements about the monthly payment is correct?

(A) Wanda must pay the full monthly payment.

(B) Wanda must pay a portion of the monthly payment based on an apportionment of the value between Wanda's life estate and Dixie's remainder.

(C) Wanda must pay the portion of the monthly payment that represents interest.

(D) Dixie must pay the full monthly payment.

Questions 21-22 are based on the following fact situation:

The owner of Newacre executed and delivered to a power company a right-of-way deed for the building and maintenance of an overhead power line across Newacre. The deed was properly recorded. Newacre then passed through several intermediate conveyances until it was conveyed to Sloan about 10 years after the date of the right-of-way deed. All the intermediate deeds were properly recorded, but none of them mentioned the right-of-way.

Sloan entered into a written contract to sell Newacre to Jones. By the terms of the contract, Sloan promised to furnish an abstract of title to Jones. Sloan contracted directly with Abstract Company to prepare and deliver an abstract to Jones, and Abstract Company did so. The abstract omitted the right-of-way deed. Jones delivered the abstract to his attorney and asked the attorney for an opinion as to title. The attorney signed and delivered to Jones a letter stating that, from the attorney's examination of the abstract, it was his "opinion that Sloan had a free and unencumbered marketable title to Newacre."

Sloan conveyed Newacre to Jones by a deed which included covenants of general warranty and against encumbrances. Jones paid the full purchase price. After Jones had been in possession of Newacre for more than a year, he learned about the right-of-way deed. Sloan, Jones, Abstract Company, and Jones's attorney were all without actual knowledge of the existence of the right-of-way prior to the conveyance from Sloan to Jones.

21. If Jones sues Abstract Company for damages caused to Jones by the presence of the right-of-way, the most likely result will be a decision for:

(A) Jones, because Jones was a thirdparty creditor beneficiary of the contract between Sloan and Abstract Company.

(B) Jones, because the abstract prepared by Abstract Company constitutes a guarantee of Jones's title to Newacre.

(C) Abstract Company, because Abstract Company had no knowledge of the existence of the right-of-way.

(D) Abstract Company, because there was no showing that any fraud was practiced upon Jones.

22. If Jones sues Sloan because of the presence of the right-of-way, the most likely result will be a decision for:

(A) Jones, because Sloan is liable for his negligent misrepresentation.

(B) Jones, because the covenants in Sloan's deed to Jones have been breached. (C) Sloan, because Jones relied upon Abstract Company, not Sloan, for information concerning title.

(D) Sloan, because Sloan was without knowledge of any defects in the title to Newacre.

\section{Question 23}

Testator devised his farm "to my son, Selden, for life, then to Selden's children and their heirs and assigns." Selden, a widower, had two unmarried adult children.

In an appropriate action to construe the will, the court will determine that the remainder to the children is:
(A) Indefeasibly vested.
(B) Contingent.
(C) Vested subject to partial defeasance.
(D) Vested subject to complete defeasance.

Questions 24-25 are based on the following fact situation:

Ohner holds title in fee simple to a tract of 1,500 acres. He desires to develop the entire tract as a golf course, country club, and residential subdivision. He contemplates forming a corporation to own and to operate the golf course and country club; the stock in the corporation will be distributed to the owners of lots in the residential portions of the subdivision, but no obligation to issue the stock is to ripen until all the residential lots are sold. The price of the lots is intended to return enough money to compensate Ohner for the raw land, development costs (including the building of the golf course and the country club facilities), and developer's profit, if all of the lots are sold.

Ohner's market analyses indicate that he must create a scheme of development that will offer prospective purchasers (and their lawyers) a very high order of assurance that several aspects will be clearly established:

1. Aside from the country club and golf course, there will be no land use other than for residential use and occupancy in the 1,500 acres.

2. The residents of the subdivision will have unambiguous right of access to the club and golf course facilities.

3. Each lot owner must have an unambiguous right to transfer his lot to a purchaser with all original benefits.

4. Each lot owner must be obligated to pay annual dues to a pro rata share (based on the number of lots) of the club's annual operating deficit (whether or not such owner desires to make use of club and course facilities).

24. In the context of all aspects of the scheme, which of the following will offer the best chance of implementing the requirement that each lot owner pay annual dues to support the club and golf course?
(A) Covenant.
(B) Easement.
(C) Mortgage.
(D) Personal contractual obligation by each purchaser.

25. Of the following, the greatest difficulty that will be encountered in establishing the scheme is that:

(A) Any judicial recognition will be construed as state action which, under current doctrines, raises a substantial question whether such action would be in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.

(B) The scheme, if effective, renders title unmarketable. (C) One or more of the essential aspects outlined by Ohner will result in a restraint on alienation.

(D) There is a judicial reluctance to recognize an affirmative burden to pay money in installments and over an indefinite period as a burden that can be affixed to bind future owners of land.

\section{Question 26}

Oaks, the owner of Blackacre, conveyed a right-of-way to United Utility "for the underground transportation of gas by pipeline, the location of right-of-way to be mutually agreed upon by Oaks and United Utility." United Utility then installed a six-inch pipeline at a location selected by it and not objected to by Oaks. Two years later, United Utility advised Oaks of its intention to install an additional six-inch pipeline parallel to and three feet laterally from the original pipeline. In an appropriate action, Oaks sought a declaration that United Utility has no right to install the second pipeline.

If Oaks prevails, it will be because:

(A) Any right implied to expand the original use of the right-of-way creates an interest that violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.

(B) The original installation by United Utility defined the scope of the easement.

(C) Oaks did not expressly agree to the location of the right-of-way.

(D) The assertion of the right to install an additional pipeline constitutes inverse condemnation.

\section{Question 27}

Martinez, a widower, owns in fee simple a ranch, Ranchacre. Martinez has one child, Enrique, who is married. Enrique has one child, Ana Maria, who is also married but has no children. In an effort to dispose of Ranchacre to his descendants and to honor a request by Ana Maria that she be skipped in any such disposition, Martinez conveys Ranchacre to his son, Enrique, for life with the remainder to Ana Maria's children in fee simple.

What interest, if any, is created in favor of Ana Maria's unborn children at the time of the conveyance?
(A) A contingent remainder.
(B) A vested remainder subject to divestment.
(C) A springing use.
(D) None.

\section{Question 28}

While hospitalized, Marsh requested her attorney to draw a deed conveying her home to her son, Simon. While Marsh remained in the hospital, the deed was drawn, properly executed, and promptly and properly recorded. On being informed of the existence of the deed, Simon told his mother, "I want no part of the property; take the deed right back." Marsh recovered and left the hospital, but shortly thereafter, before any other relevant event, Simon died intestate.

Marsh brought an appropriate action against Simon's heirs to determine title.

If Marsh wins, it will be because:
(A) The court will impose a constructive trust to carry out the intent of the deceased son.
(B) The presumption of delivery arising from the recording is not valid unless the grantee has knowledge at the time of the recording.
(C) Simon's declaration was a constructive reconveyance of the land.
(D) There was no effective acceptance of delivery of the deed. 

\section{Question 29}

Andres conveyed Applewood Farm "to Bogatz, her heirs and assigns, so long as the premises are used for residential and farm purposes, then to Cohen and his heirs."' The common law Rule Against Perpetuities, unmodified by statute, is part of the law of the jurisdiction in which Applewood Farm is located.

As a consequence of the conveyance, Cohen's interest in Applewood Farm is:
(A) Nothing.
(B) A valid executory interest.
(C) A possibility of reverter.
(D) A right of entry for condition broken.

\section{Question 30}

Metterly, the owner in fee simple of Brownacre, by quitclaim deed conveyed Brownacre to her daughter, Doris, who paid no consideration for the conveyance. The deed was never recorded. About a year after the delivery of the deed, Metterly decided that this gift had been ill-advised. She requested that Doris destroy the deed, which Doris dutifully and voluntarily did. Within the month following the destruction of the deed, Metterly and Doris were killed in a common disaster. Each of the successors in interest claimed title to Brownacre.

In an appropriate action to determine the title to Brownacre, the probable outcome will be that:

(A) Metterly was the owner of Brownacre, because Doris was a donee and therefore could not acquire title by quitclaim deed.

(B) Metterly was the owner of Brownacre, because title to Brownacre reverted to her upon the voluntary destruction of the deed by Doris. (C) Doris was the owner of Brownacre, because her destruction of the deed to Brownacre was under the undue influence of Metterly.

(D) Doris was the owner of Brownacre, because the deed was merely evidence of her title, and its destruction was insufficient to cause title to pass back to Metterly.

\section{Question 31}

By her validly executed will, Sallie devised a certain tract of land to her son, Ben, for his life with remainder to such of Ben's children as should be living at his death, "Provided, however, that no such child of Ben shall mortgage or sell, or attempt to mortgage or sell, his or her interest in the property prior to attaining 25 years of age; and, if any such child of Ben shall violate this provision, then upon such violation his or her interest shall pass to and become the property of the remaining children of Ben then living, share and share alike."

Sallie's will included an identical provision for each of her four other children concerning four other tracts of land. The residuary clause of the will gave the residuary estate to Sallie's five children equally. Sallie died and was survived by the five children named in her will and by 11 grandchildren. Several additional grandchildren have since been born.

In an action for a declaration of rights, it was claimed that the attempted gifts to Sallie's grandchildren were entirely void and that the interests following the life estates to Sallie's children passed to the children absolutely by the residuary clause.

Assuming that the action was properly brought with all necessary parties and with a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the interests of unborn and infant grandchildren, the decision should be that:

(A) The attempted gifts to grandchildren are void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.

(B) The attempted gifts to grandchildren are void as unlawful restraints on alienation. (C) The provisions concerning grandchildren are valid and will be upheld according to their terms.

(D) Even if the provisions against sale or mortgage by the grandchildren are void, the remainders to grandchildren are otherwise valid and will be given effect.

Questions 32-33 are based on the following fact situation:

Meadowview is a large tract of undeveloped land. Black, the owner of Meadowview, prepared a development plan creating 200 house lots in Meadowview with the necessary streets and public areas. The plan was fully approved by all necessary governmental agencies and duly recorded. However, construction of the streets, utilities, and other aspects of the development of Meadowview has not yet begun, and none of the streets can be opened as public ways until they are completed in accordance with the applicable ordinances of the municipality in which Meadowview is located.

College Avenue, one of the streets laid out as part of the Meadowview development, abuts Whiteacre, an adjacent one-acre parcel owned by White. Whiteacre has no access to any public way except an old, poorly developed road which is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. White sold Whiteacre to Breyer. The description used in the deed from White to Breyer was the same as that used in prior deeds except that the portion of the description which formerly said, "thence by land of Black, northeasterly a distance of 200 feet, more or less," was changed to "thence by College Avenue as laid out on the Plan of Meadowview North $16^{\circ}$ East $201.6$ feet," with full reference to the plan and as recording data.

Breyer now seeks a building permit which will show that Breyer intends to use College Avenue for access to Whiteacre. Black objects to the granting of a building permit on the grounds that he has never granted any rights to White or Breyer to use College Avenue. There are no governing statutes or ordinances relating to the problem. Black brings an appropriate action in which the right of Breyer to use College Avenue without an express grant from Black is at issue.

32. The best argument for Black in this action is that:

(A) Breyer's right must await the action of appropriate public authorities to open College Avenue as a public street, since no private easements arose by implication.

(B) The Statute of Frauds prevents the introduction of evidence which might prove the necessity for Breyer to use College Avenue.

(C) Breyer's right to use College Avenue is restricted to the assertion of a way by necessity and the facts preclude the success of such a claim.

(D) Breyer would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to use College Avenue.

33. The best argument for Breyer in this action is that:

(A) There is a way by necessity over Meadowview's lands to gain access to a public road.

(B) The deed from White to Breyer referred to the recorded plan and therefore created rights to use the streets delineated on the plan.

(C) Sale of lots in Meadowview by reference to its plan creates private easements in the streets shown on the plan.

(D) The recording of the plan is a dedication of the streets shown on the plan to public use. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

\section{Question 34}

Lester, the owner in fee simple of a small farm consisting of 30 acres of land improved with a house and several outbuildings, leased the same to Tanner for a 10 -year period. After two years had expired, the government condemned 20 acres of the property and allocated the compensation award to Lester and Tanner according to their respective interest so taken. It so happened, however, that the 20 acres taken embraced all of the farm's tillable land, leaving only the house, outbuildings, and a small woodlot. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction where the property is located nor any provision in the lease relating to condemnation. Tanner quit possession and Lester brought suit against him to recover rent.

Lester will: (A) Lose, because there has been a frustration of purpose which excuses Tanner from further performance of his contract to pay rent.

(B) Lose, because there has been a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment by Lester's inability to provide Tanner with possession of the whole of the property for the entire term.

(C) Win, because of the implied warranty on the part of the tenant to return the demised premises in the same condition at the end of the term as they were at the beginning.

(D) Win, because the relationship of landlord and tenant was unaffected by the condemnation, thus leaving Tanner still obligated to pay rent. 

\section{REAL PROPERTY ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(B) Every land sale contract (not deed) contains an implied warranty of marketable title. For bar examination purposes, title acquired by adverse possession is unmarketable. However, the buyer's acceptance of a deed discharges the seller's contractual obligation to furnish marketable title, and leaves the buyer with remedies only on the covenants in the deed. (D) is wrong because a deed contains no implied covenant of marketability. (A) is wrong because it is not supported by the facts, and (C) is an incorrect statement of law; a buyer can choose to rescind, sue for damages for breach, get specific performance with abatement of the purchase price, or, in some jurisdictions, require the seller to quiet title.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(C) Acceptance of a deed discharges the seller's liability on the contract. Since the deed here contained no covenants of title, it was a quitclaim deed. Conveyances under a quitclaim deed give the buyer only that which the seller owns. If Sue did not own the one acre she believed that she had acquired by adverse possession, then her quitclaim deed conveyed only the four remaining acres to Peg. Thus, Peg cannot prevail and (B) and (D) are wrong. (A) is not supported by the facts.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(D) Once a land sale contract is signed, the doctrine of equitable conversion applies, making the buyer the equitable owner of the property. Under the majority view, the risk of loss then rests on the buyer; Peg must pay the purchase price. Thus, (D) is correct and the other choices are incorrect. Note that if Sue had insured the house for loss by fire, most courts would require her to give Peg credit, in the amount of the insurance proceeds, against the purchase price.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(C) Painter's acceptance of the deed constituted a discharge of Owens's liability on the contract. A quitclaim deed contains no warranties and conveys only what the seller owns-here, property encumbered by an easement. Therefore, (C) is correct and (D) is inapplicable since there was no breach. (A) and (B) are not valid defenses, since existence of the easement was violative of the contract. The contract contained an implied warranty of marketable title, which generally means an unencumbered fee simple with good record title. An easement is an encumbrance. Note that if Owens had conveyed a general warranty deed to Painter, it would have contained a covenant against encumbrances.

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(A) Anti-transfer covenants are strictly construed; therefore, a prohibition against subleasing does not prevent assignment, and (C) is thus incorrect. (D) is wrong because an anti-assignment covenant must be express. Regarding (B), disabling restraints on a legal interest are always void. However, lease provisions restricting assignments and subleases are valid restraints. These are considered promissory restraints, breach of which will void an attempted assignment or transfer. Thus, (B) is wrong.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(A) Oleg expressly conveyed a fee simple to Bob and Bill as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Since the joint tenancy was not severed, Bill became the owner in fee simple at the instant 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

of Bob's death. Bob's will was not effective until his death, at which time he no longer had an interest in the property; the act of making a will containing a testamentary devise of the land is not sufficient to sever the joint tenancy. Hence, Bob's attempt to devise his interest was inoperative, and (B) and (C) are thus incorrect. (D) is wrong because conveyance by quitclaim deed does not render title unmarketable.

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(B) If Oscar had a scheme for an exclusively residential subdivision, the court could imply a reciprocal negative servitude limiting the remaining lots to the same use. Reciprocal negative servitudes are implied only when the sales begin. Since all 140 lots already sold contain the covenant restricting the land use to single-family residential dwellings, a common scheme will be implied. Any subsequent purchaser will be bound by the covenant if there was notice. The appearance of an area containing only single-family residences is sufficient to constitute inquiry notice. Hence, (A) is wrong. (C) is incorrect because covenants are a private land use control. (D) is wrong because the issue does not concern construction of the deeds.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(D) If Oscar had no uniform development scheme, there is no basis for implying a residential restriction in Doyle's deed. (A) is not the best defense because selling difficulties probably do not establish changes such as would render enforcement of the covenants inequitable. (B) is wrong because restraints upon use (as opposed to restraints upon alienation) of land are valid and enforceable. (C) is wrong because monetary loss is irrelevant in an action to establish an implied equitable servitude.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(B) Pike had a fee simple subject to a shifting executory interest in Farley. If Farley lives 30 more years, the fee simple will shift to him. Therefore, (B) is correct and (D) is wrong. The Rule Against Perpetuities requires that the interest vest, if at all, within 21 years after a life in being and, using Farley's life as the measuring life, it is clear that his interest will vest, if at all, within his lifetime. (A) is wrong because a reversion occurs by operation of law when a grantor conveys less than the entire estate. Here, Odum transferred a fee simple in Brightacre to either Pike or Farley; there was no interest left to revert to Odum. (C) is wrong because an executory interest is not vested.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(A) The class of Trease's grandchildren would close at the death of his last surviving child, who was necessarily a life in being at Trease's death (when the gift took effect); the gift would then vest (or fail) within 21 years thereafter. (C) is wrong because the express language of the will controls. The rule of convenience is used to determine when a class closes only absent an express intent to include all persons described no matter when born. Since Trease expressed such an intention, the rule is inapplicable and (B) is incorrect. (D) is wrong because the gift is valid without resort to preferential rules of construction.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(C) If Trease had made the gift by inter vivos conveyance, he might have had another child thereafter who would not have been a life in being at the creation of the interest (and whose children might have reached 21 after the permissible perpetuities period). (A) is wrong because the Rule Against Perpetuities allows for periods of gestation. (B) is wrong because it changes nothing; the will already expresses an intention to include afterborn grandchildren. Further, (B) and (D) are wrong because all of Trease's grandchildren would be born to his children, who were lives in being at his death.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(B) Priorities based on time of recording would protect most persons obtaining an interest in land that is timely recorded. Since the purpose of recordation is to give notice to others of a conveyance of title, prospective purchasers could easily determine the status of the title. Furthermore, priorities based on recording generally protect bona fide purchasers. (D) is wrong because simply protecting bona fide purchasers would not assure an accurate reflection of priority of title on the public record (e.g., "notice" statutes). (A) and (C) alone have no bearing on priority of title. Moreover, they are misstatements of law; witnesses to a deed are generally unnecessary and no recital of consideration is required for a valid deed.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(A) A subsequent grantee has constructive knowledge of all prior recorded deeds except those outside of his chain of title. (B) and (D) are wrong because Niece's recordation would be relevant only if she had been a bona fide purchaser who could "shelter" Barrett. Under the shelter rule, a person who takes from a bona fide purchaser will prevail against any interest that the bona fide purchaser would have prevailed against-even if the grantee knew of the prior unrecorded interest. However, donees are not bona fide purchasers and thus, are not protected. (C) is wrong because the state statute governs priority of title.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(D) Leon will prevail because he had no actual or constructive notice of the conveyance to Allred, since it was not recorded at the time of the mortgage. A mortgagee who gives a concurrent loan is considered a purchaser for value within state recording acts. Hence, (A) and (B) are incorrect. (C) is wrong because the statute is a pure notice statute, which does not require that the subsequent purchaser be the first to record to protect his rights against a prior purchaser.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(C) Judgment should be for Allred. Under the statute, unrecorded conveyances are void only as against bona fide purchasers. Since Niece took by a gratuitous conveyance, her prior recordation without notice is irrelevant. Thus, (A) and (B) are incorrect because Niece is not protected by the recording statute. (D) is incorrect because, absent a bona fide purchaser, priority is determined by the first-in-time rule.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(D) Because the easement was validly created and recorded, the removal of the need for the easement does not affect the continuing right to the easement. (A) is wrong because there is no such automatic termination. If the parties had failed validly to create the easement in this case, a court might still have found an easement by necessity. If that had been the case, the end of the necessity would result in the expiration of the easement. But that was not the case here. Because an easement was created and recorded, the fact that the easement is no longer necessary has no 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

bearing on its continued existence. The easement could be terminated by release or abandonment, but Bell does not wish to terminate the easement. (B) is wrong because an easement is a right that exists even if it adversely affects the marketability of land. (C) is wrong because easements can be terminated in ways other than by a writing. For example, Bell could abandon his easement by long nonuse accompanied by intent to abandon.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(D) Bell has no claim because he had no easement for light, air, or view. (A) is wrong because there is no "natural right" to an easement for light and air. (B) is wrong because Bell's building of his house has no relationship to whether an easement for light and air was created. (C) is wrong because even if Ogden had no plans, at the time of his conveyance to Bell, to erect such a building, no easement for light and air would automatically be created. Bell could have requested and could have been granted an easement for light, air, or view, but there is no evidence that he did so.

\section{Answer to Question 18}

(A) A life tenant is obligated to pay interest on any encumbrances to the extent of the income or profits from the land. He does not, however, have to pay anything on the principal. The remainderman, here Rowan, must pay off the principal in order to protect her own interests. (B) is wrong because Rowan is only liable for the principal. (C) is wrong because Perez is only liable for the interest payments. (D) is wrong because it reverses the duties of the life tenant and the remainderman.

\section{Answer to Question 19}

(C) Anders could have constructed a deed such that she would have retained a property interest in the parcel of land, but she did not do so. Rather, she only created a contractual obligation which was met in the first five years after the conveyance. Because she retained no property interest, she has no claim to the land. (A) is wrong because this could have been a determinable fee only if durational language, such as "for as long as," "while," "during," or "until," had been used in the deed. Because it was not, no possibility of reverter was created in Anders. (B) is wrong because the grantor did not reserve the right to terminate the grantee's estate on the happening of a specified condition subsequent, and thus reserved no right of entry for condition broken. (D) is wrong because it has been stated that Anders has instituted an appropriate action, so it is assumed that she is in the proper court. In any event, the contract or covenant obligation of Burton would probably be enforceable both at law (for damages) and in equity (for an injunction). In most jurisdictions today the same court could order either remedy.

\section{Answer to Question 20}

(C) The application of a basic allocation rule is involved here. A life tenant is obligated to pay interest on any encumbrances on the land to the extent of the income or profits from the land (or in their absence to the extent of the reasonable rental value of the land). However, she does not have to pay anything on the principal of the debt: reversioners or remaindermen must pay the principal in order to protect their interests. Thus, $(\mathrm{C})$ is correct because it applies the rule correctly. (A) is incorrect because Dixie must make the portion of the monthly payment allocated to principal. (B) is wrong because the allocation between life tenant and remainderman is a simple allocation between interest and principal and hence the actual value of the life estate and the remainder are not considered. (D) is wrong because Wanda must make the portion of the monthly payment allocated to interest.

\section{Answer to Question 21}

(A) Jones was the intended third-party creditor beneficiary of the contract between Sloan and the Abstract Company to prepare and deliver the abstract. Abstract Company is liable because it failed to uncover the existence of the right-of-way deed which was in the chain of title. Jones should recover because he was the intended beneficiary. (B) is wrong because Abstract Company is liable on breach of its contract to describe accurately the state of the record title. It gave no title guarantee. (C) is wrong because, while Abstract Company may have had no actual knowledge of the deed, it had a contractual duty to find any encumbrances in the record chain of title. (D) is wrong because fraud is not necessary for a showing of breach of contract.

\section{Answer to Question 22}

(B) Sloan conveyed a deed including covenants of general warranty and against encumbrances. Because an encumbrance exists in the form of the right-of-way, Sloan is in breach of the covenant against encumbrances. (A) is wrong because Sloan was diligent in his attempt to establish clear title through the Abstract Company. (C) is wrong because it was Sloan and not the Abstract Company which actually made the covenant against encumbrances. (D) is wrong because Sloan covenanted that there were no encumbrances at all. It makes no difference whether he had any actual knowledge of such encumbrances.

\section{Answer to Question 23}

(C) Because the remainder is created in a class of persons (i.e., Selden's children) that is certain to take on the termination of the preceding estate, but is subject to diminution by reason of other persons becoming entitled to share in the remainder (i.e., additional children that Selden could sire), the remainder is vested subject to partial defeasance (or divestment). This is also sometimes called a vested remainder subject to open. (A) is wrong because an indefeasibly vested remainder must not be subject to being diminished in size, which could be the case if Selden has more children. (B) is incorrect because the remainder here is not subject to a condition precedent or in favor of unborn or unascertained persons. Hence, it is not contingent. (D) is wrong because a vested remainder subject to complete defeasance arises when the remainderman is in existence and ascertained and his right to possession and enjoyment is subject to being defeated by the happening of some condition subsequent. Under the facts, Selden's children or their heirs under all circumstances will be entitled to a portion of the fee.

\section{Answer to Question 24}

(A) A covenant is the best choice because a real covenant, normally found in deeds, is a written promise to do something on the land or a promise not to do something on the land. Real covenants run with the land at law, which means that subsequent owners of the land may enforce or be burdened by the covenant. In cases where the covenant involves a promise to pay money, the majority rule is that if the money is to be used in a way connected with the land, the burden will run with the land. The most common example is a covenant to pay a homeowners' association an annual fee for maintenance of common ways, parks, etc., in a subdivision. Such a situation is analogous to the golf course and country club dues presented in the facts. (B) is incorrect because the holder of an easement has the right to use a tract of land (called the servient tenement) for a special purpose but has no right to possess and use the land. The annual dues requirement does 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

not constitute the right to use another's land for a special purpose. (C) is incorrect because a mortgage is a security interest in real estate (usually to secure a promise to repay a loan represented by a promissory note). The payment of dues does not result in a security interest in the golf course, and is thus inapplicable to the facts. (D) is wrong because a personal contractual obligation by each purchaser does not bind subsequent purchasers, who would, therefore, be under no obligation to pay the annual dues.

\section{Answer to Question 25}

(D) (D) is the correct answer by a process of elimination. (A) is incorrect because there is no racial discrimination or other constitutionally questionable activity presented in the facts. (B) is wrong because marketable title is title reasonably free from doubt. Generally, this involves either defects in the chain of title or encumbrances that might present an unreasonable risk of litigation. The dues scheme is not such an encumbrance. (C) is incorrect because the scheme does not impose a direct restraint on alienation of the fee. There are no disabling restraints, forfeiture restraints, or promissory restraints on transferability of property. Thus, by a process of elimination, (D) presents the greatest obstacle to establishing the scheme, even though a majority of courts today allow real covenants that require payment of an annual fee for maintenance of common ways, parks, etc.

\section{Answer to Question 26}

(B) If Oaks prevails, it will be because the original installation defined the scope of the easement. The scope of the easement depends on the intent of the parties. In determining the intent of the parties, the courts look at the subsequent conduct of the parties respecting the arrangement as well as the language of the instrument. Here, the instrument states the location is to be mutually agreed upon. Oaks and United agreed to the original pipeline and its location, but have not agreed upon the location of the second set of pipes. The parties' subsequent conduct could also lead to the conclusion that the first installation was the full extent of what the parties intended. (A) is incorrect because the Rule Against Perpetuities has absolutely no application to these facts. The easement was vested when it was created, and easements are presumed to be perpetual. (C) is incorrect because Oaks will be deemed to have acquiesced in the location of the original easement. (D) is wrong because inverse condemnation is the term for a landowner's lawsuit for damages to recover for a governmental taking without exercising its formal power of eminent domain (e.g., regulatory takings that deprive the owner of all economically viable uses of the property). Even if United were a government agency and this were a regulatory taking, inverse condemnation would not be correct since Oaks is seeking an injunction, not compensation.

\section{Answer to Question 27}

(A) A remainder is a future interest created in a transferee that is capable of becoming a present interest upon the natural termination of the preceding estates created in the same disposition. A contingent remainder is a remainder that is subject to a condition precedent, or a remainder that is created in favor of unborn or unascertained persons. Here, Ana Maria's unborn children will take a remainder, because their interest will become a present interest upon the natural termination of the preceding estate (upon Enrique's death). Because this remainder is created in favor of unborn and unascertained persons, it is contingent. A vested remainder subject to divestment arises when the remainderman is in existence and ascertained and his interest is not subject to any condition precedent, but his right to possession is subject to being defeated by some condition subsequent. (B) is incorrect because the remaindermen are neither in existence nor ascertained. A springing use is a form of executory interest (a future interest in a transferee that is not capable of taking on the natural termination of the preceding estate). (C) is incorrect because Ana Maria's children's interest will become a present interest upon the natural termination of the preceding estate. Finally, because (A) is correct, (D) is obviously incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 28}

(D) If Marsh wins, it will be because there was no effective acceptance of delivery of the deed. There must be acceptance by the grantee to complete a conveyance. Although acceptance is presumed, this presumption is rebutted by evidence of rejection. Here, Simon expressly rejected the conveyance, and therefore, title never passed to Simon. (A) is incorrect because a constructive trust presumes that Simon had legal title. As discussed above, title did not pass to Simon. Furthermore, even had title passed, a constructive trust would probably be inappropriate here. Constructive trust is the appropriate remedy for unjust enrichment, and there is no indication of any wrongdoing under these facts. (B) is an incorrect statement of law. If the grantor intends the recording of the deed to be the final act in vesting title in the grantee, such recording creates a presumption of delivery even though the grantee did not know of the recordation. (C) is wrong because there is no such thing as a constructive reconveyance. Had Simon accepted the deed and then changed his mind, he would have had to execute a new deed to reconvey the property back to Marsh.

\section{Answer to Question 29}

(A) Cohen's interest purports to be an executory limitation. However, Cohen cannot take the land until such time as the premises are no longer used for residential and farm purposes. This could happen more than 21 years after the death of Bogatz or Cohen, the relevant lives in being. Thus, this interest violates the Rule Against Perpetuities. It follows that (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect. Note also that, regarding (C) and (D), possibilities of reverter and rights of entry for condition broken are future interests left in a grantor. Cohen is not a grantor.

\section{Answer to Question 30}

(D) The deed, once it has been delivered, is merely evidence of its own existence, and its destruction does not cause any change in the title. Doris therefore continued to own the property. (A) is wrong because a title can be acquired by a quitclaim deed and that is true, even though the grantee has paid no consideration. (B) is wrong because destruction of the deed does not cause title to revert. (C) is wrong because there is no evidence of undue influence, and, in any event, destruction of the deed would cause no change in the status of the title.

\section{Answer to Question 31}

(D) The question is somewhat confusing, since there are really two gifts to grandchildren. The first is the vested remainder in the grandchildren that follows Ben's life estate. The second is the executory interest that is given to the other grandchildren if one of the grandchildren purports to mortgage or sell in violation of the condition. This latter gift is void both as a violation of the Rule Against Perpetuities and as an unlawful restraint on alienation. It violates the Rule because by its terms it could purport to vest possession in the "other" grandchildren more than 21 years after the termination of a life in being. However, these objections apply only to the second of the two gifts to the grandchildren. The first gift, that is, the remainder to them, is entirely valid. The 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

language dealing with the restraint on alienation would probably be stricken by the court, leaving the initial gift intact. (D) is the answer that best expresses this result.

\section{Answer to Question 32}

(A) The best argument is that Breyer's rights depend on the existence of a public street. (B) is wrong because no issue of the Statute of Frauds is present. There has been no purported conveyance to Breyer of rights in the street by anyone who owns such rights. (C) is wrong because, if a public street exists, Breyer need not assert a way of necessity. (D) is wrong because there is no legal objection to the enrichment that results if persons other than the dedicator are permitted to use a public street.

\section{Answer to Question 33}

(D) The dedication argument is Breyer's strongest, although even it is not likely to be successful unless and until the city bodies accept the dedication. (A) is wrong because Breyer does not need a way of necessity, since he has other access to his land. (B) is wrong because the deed from White to Breyer, while referring to the plan, used it only as a boundary reference and did not create any rights to the use of the streets. (C) is wrong because, while the sale of lots by reference to a plan does create private easements in the streets, the easements serve only the lots in the subdivision plan itself and not such land as Whiteacre that is outside the plan.

\section{Answer to Question 34}

(D) In a partial condemnation case, the landlord-tenant relationship continues, as does the tenant's obligation to pay the entire rent for the remaining lease term. (A) is wrong because the law of landlord and tenant traditionally refuses to recognize frustration of purpose as a ground for termination of a lease. $(\mathrm{B})$ is wrong because the covenant of quiet enjoyment can be breached only by actions of the landlord and not those of a third party, such as the government. (C) is wrong because, while the tenant generally is obligated to return the premises in the same condition as when received (except for ordinary wear and tear), that obligation would not be considered breached by the actions of a third party such as the government. 

\section{TORTS QUESTIONS}

Questions 1-2 are based on the following fact situation:

Innes worked as a secretary in an office in a building occupied partly by her employer and partly by Glass, a retail store. The two areas were separated by walls and were in no way connected, except that the air conditioning unit served both areas and there was a common return-air duct.

Glass began remodeling, and its employees did the work, which included affixing a plastic surfacing material to counters. To fasten the plastic to the counters, the employees purchased glue, with the brand name Stick, that was manufactured by Steel, packaged in a sealed container by Steel, and retailed by Paint Company.

In the course of the remodeling job, one of Glass's employees turned on the air conditioning and caused fumes from the glue to travel from Glass through the air conditioning unit and into Innes's office. The employees did not know that there was common ductwork for the air conditioners. Innes was permanently blinded by the fumes from the glue.

The label on the container of glue read, "DANGER. Do not smoke near this product. Extremely flammable. Contains Butanone, Toluol, and Hexane. Use with adequate ventilation. Keep out of the reach of children."

The three chemicals listed on the label are very toxic and harmful to human eyes. Steel had received no reports of eye injuries during the 10 years that the product had been manufactured and sold.

1. If Innes asserts a claim against Paint Company, the most likely result is that she will:

(A) Recover if she can recover against Steel.

(B) Recover, because Innes was an invitee of a tenant in the building. (C) Not recover, unless Paint Company was negligent.

(D) Not recover, because the glue came in a sealed package.

2. If Innes asserts a claim against Glass, the most likely result is that she will:

(A) Recover, because a user of a product is held to the same standard as the manufacturer.

(B) Recover, because the employees of Glass caused the fumes to enter her area of the building.

(C) Not recover, because Glass used the glue for its intended purpose.

(D) Not recover, because the employees of Glass had no reason to know that the fumes could injure Innes.

Questions 3-4 are based on the following fact situation:

When Denton heard that his neighbor, Prout, intended to sell his home to a minority purchaser, Denton told Prout that Prout and his wife and children would meet with "accidents" if he did so. Prout then called the prospective purchaser and told him that he was taking the house off the market.

3. If Prout asserts a claim against Denton for assault, Prout will:

(A) Recover if Denton intended to place Prout in fear of physical harm.

(B) Recover, because Denton's conduct was extreme and outrageous.

(C) Not recover if Denton took no action that threatened immediate physical harm to Prout.

(D) Not recover, because Prout's action removed any threat of harmful force. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

4. If Prout asserts a claim against Denton for intentional infliction of emotional distress, Prout will:

(A) Recover if Prout suffered severe emotional distress as a consequence of Denton's conduct.

(B) Recover, because Denton intended to frighten Prout.

(C) Not recover, because Denton made no threat of immediate physical harm to Prout or his family.

(D) Not recover if Prout suffered no physical harm as a consequence of Denton's conduct.

\section{Question 5}

Doctor, a licensed physician, resided in her own home. The street in front of the home had a gradual slope. Doctor's garage was on the street level, with a driveway entrance from the street.

At two in the morning, Doctor received an emergency call. She dressed and went to the garage to get her car and found a car parked in front of her driveway. That car was occupied by Parker, who, while intoxicated, had driven to that place and now was in a drunken stupor in the front seat. Unable to rouse Parker, Doctor pushed him into the passenger's side of the front seat and got in on the driver's side. Doctor released the brake and coasted the car down the street, planning to pull into a parking space that was open. When Doctor attempted to stop the car, the brakes failed to work, and the car crashed into the wall of Owner's home, damaging Owner's home and Parker's car and injuring Doctor and Parker. Subsequent examination of the car disclosed that the brake linings were badly worn. A state statute prohibits the operation of a motor vehicle unless the brakes are capable of stopping the vehicle within specified distances at specified speeds. The brakes on Parker's car were incapable of stopping the vehicle within the limits required by the statute. Another state statute makes it a criminal offense to be intoxicated while driving a motor vehicle. The state follows traditional contributory negligence rules.

If Parker asserts a claim against Doctor for his injuries, Parker will probably:

(A) Recover, because Doctor was negligent as a matter of law.

(B) Recover, because Doctor had no right to move the car.

(C) Not recover, because his brakes were defective.

(D) Not recover, because he was in a drunken stupor when injured.

\section{Question 6}

Construction Company contracted to build a laundry for Wash Company on the latter's vacant lot in a residential area. As a part of its work, Construction Company dug a trench from the partially completed laundry to the edge of a public sidewalk; waterlines were to be installed in the trench. Because of the contour of the land, the trench was dug to a depth ranging from seven to nine feet. Construction Company did not place any barriers around the trench and permitted it to lie open for almost a week while waiting for the delivery of water pipes. This was known to Wash Company, but it raised no objection.

During the time the trench was open, a series of heavy rains fell, causing five feet of surface water to gather in the bottom of the trench. While this condition existed, five-year-old Tommy, who was playing on the vacant lot with friends, stumbled and fell into the trench. Robert, an adult passerby, saw this and immediately lowered himself into the trench to rescue Tommy. However, his doing so caused the rain-soaked walls of the trench to collapse, killing both him and Tommy.

In a claim for wrongful death by Tommy's administrator against Construction Company, the most likely result is that plaintiff will: (A) Recover, because the defendant left the open trench unprotected.

(B) Recover, because construction companies are strictly liable for inherently dangerous conditions.

(C) Not recover, because Tommy was a trespasser.

(D) Not recover, because Tommy's death was a result of the collapse of the trench, an independent intervening cause.

\section{Question 7}

Philip was a 10-year-old boy. Macco was a company that sold new and used machinery. Macco stored discarded machinery, pending sale for scrap, on a large vacant area it owned. This area was unfenced and was one-quarter mile from the housing development where Philip lived. Macco knew that children frequently played in this area and on the machinery. Philip's parents had directed him not to play on the machinery because it was dangerous.

One day Philip was playing on a press in Macco's storage area. The press had several wheels, each geared to the other. Philip climbed on the largest wheel, which was about five feet in diameter. Philip's weight caused the wheel to rotate, his foot was caught between two wheels that were set into motion, and he was severely injured.

A claim for relief was asserted by Philip through a duly appointed guardian. Macco denied liability and pleaded Philip's contributory fault as a defense.

In determining whether Macco breached a duty to Philip, which of the following is the most significant?

(A) Whether the press on which Philip was injured was visible from a public way.

(B) Whether the maintenance of the area for the storage of discarded machinery was a private nuisance. (C) Whether the maintenance of the area of the storage of discarded machinery was a public nuisance.

(D) Whether Macco could have eliminated the risk of harm without unduly interfering with Macco's normal operations.

\section{Question 8}

Householder hired Contractor to remodel Householder's kitchen. She had learned of him through a classified advertisement he placed in the local newspaper. During the telephone conversation in which she hired him, he stated he was experienced and qualified to do all necessary work. Because of his low charge for his work, they agreed in writing that on acceptance of his job by Householder, he would have no further liability to her or to anyone else for any defects in materials or workmanship, and that she would bear all such costs.

Householder purchased a dishwasher manufactured by Elex Company from Dealer, who was in the retail electrical appliance business. The washer was sold by Dealer with only the manufacturer's warranty and with no warranty by Dealer; Elex Company restricted its warranty to 90 days on parts and labor. Contractor installed the dishwasher.

Two months after Householder accepted the entire job, she was conversing in her home with Accountant, an acquaintance who had agreed to prepare her income tax return gratuitously. As they talked, they noticed that the dishwasher was operating strangely, repeatedly stopping and starting. At Householder's request, Accountant gave it a cursory examination and, while inspecting it, received a violent electrical shock which did him extensive harm. The dishwasher had an internal wiring defect that allowed electrical current to be carried into the framework and caused the machine to malfunction. The machine had not been adequately grounded by Contractor during installation; if it had been, the current would have been led harmlessly away. The machine carried instructions for correct grounding, which Contractor had not followed. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

If Accountant asserts a claim based on strict liability against Elex Company for damages, the probable result is that Accountant will:

(A) Recover, because the dishwasher was defectively made.

(B) Recover, because Elex Company is vicariously liable for the improper installation.

(C) Not recover, because he assumed the risk by inspecting the machine.

(D) Not recover, because he was not the purchaser.

\section{Question 9}

Diner, a drive-in hamburger and ice cream stand, recently opened for business in the suburban town of Little City. Diner's business hours are from 9 a.m. to midnight. It is in an area that for 15 years has been zoned for small retail businesses, apartment buildings, and one- and two-family residences. The zoning code specifies that "small retail businesses" include "businesses where food and drink are dispensed for consumption on the premises." Diner was the first drive-in in Little City. For seven years Mr. and Mrs. Householder have owned and lived in their single-family residence, which is across the street from Diner.

On opening day a brass band played in the parking lot of Diner until midnight, and the noise of cars and the usual activity as a result of the new business prevented the Householders from getting to sleep until well after midnight, long after their usual time. Diner is heavily patronized during the day and night by high school students. The noise of cars, the lights of the cars, the lights illuminating the parking lot at Diner, and the noise from the loudspeaker of the ordering system prevented the Householders from sleeping before midnight. Paper cups, napkins, and other items from the drive-in are regularly blown into the Householders's front yard by the prevailing wind. The traffic to and from Diner is so heavy on the street in front of their house that the Householders are afraid to allow their small children to play in the front yard.

The Householders have asserted a claim against Diner based on private nuisance.

The most likely effect of the fact that the Householders were in the area before Diner is that it:

(A) Requires that the Householders' interest be given priority.

(B) Is irrelevant because of the zoning ordinance.

(C) Is irrelevant because conforming economic uses are given priority.

(D) Is some, but not controlling, evidence.

Questions 10-11 are based on the following fact situation:

In City of State Y, Maple Street is a local public thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for northbound traffic. Pine Street is a public thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for eastbound traffic. Maple and Pine Streets intersect at right angles. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. There are two sets of lights, one at the northeast corner and one at the northwest corner, for traffic on Maple Street. There are two sets of lights, one at the northeast corner and one at the southeast corner, for traffic on Pine Street.

Trucker was making a delivery to a market on the east side of Maple Street, just north of its intersection with Pine Street. There being insufficient space for his truck and enclosed trailer, he parked it with the rear of the trailer extending entirely across the crosswalk on the north side of the intersection. The height of the trailer was such that it entirely obscured the traffic light on the northeast corner from the view of traffic moving east on Pine Street. Unknown to Trucker, the traffic light at the southeast corner was not functioning, because a collision 72 hours earlier had knocked down the pole from which the light was suspended. Visitor, on his first trip to City, was driving east on Pine Street. Not seeing any traffic light or pole, he entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. Driver, proceeding north on Maple Street and seeing the green light, entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck Visitor's car. Driver received personal injuries, and Visitor's car was damaged severely as a result of the impact.

Statutes of State Y make it a misdemeanor (1) to park a motor vehicle so that any part projects into a crosswalk and (2) to enter an intersection contrary to a traffic signal.

10. If Driver asserts a claim against Trucker and establishes that Trucker was negligent, the likely result is that Trucker's negligence is:
(A) A legal but not an actual cause of Driver's injuries.
(B) An actual but not a legal cause of Driver's injuries.
(C) Both an actual and a legal cause of Driver's injuries.

(D) Neither an actual nor a legal cause of Driver's injuries.

11. If Driver asserts a claim against City, the theory on which he has the best chance of prevailing is that City:
(A) Is strictly liable for harm caused by a defective traffic signal.
(B) Was negligent in not replacing the broken pole within 72 hours.
(C) Had an absolute duty to maintain installed signals in good operating order.
(D) Created a dangerous trap by not promptly replacing the broken pole.

\section{Question 12}

Henry hated Wanda, his former wife, for divorcing him and marrying John a short time thereafter. About a month after Wanda married John, Henry secretly entered Wanda and John's rented apartment during their absence by using a master key. Henry placed a microphone behind the bookstand in the bedroom of the apartment and drilled a hole in the nearby wall, with the result that the microphone appeared to be connected with wires going into the adjoining apartment. Actually, the microphone was not connected to anything. Henry anticipated that Wanda would discover the microphone in a few days and would be upset by the thought that someone had been listening to her conversations with John in their bedroom.

Shortly thereafter, as he was putting a book on the stand, John noticed the wires behind the bookstand and discovered the hidden microphone. He then called Wanda and showed her the microphone and wires. Wanda fainted and, in falling, struck her head on the bookstand and suffered a mild concussion. The next day John telephoned Henry and accused him of planting the microphone. Henry laughingly admitted it. Because of his concern about Wanda and his anger at Henry, John is emotionally upset and unable to go to work. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

If Wanda asserts a claim against Henry based on infliction of mental distress, the fact that John was the person who showed her the microphone will:

(A) Relieve Henry of liability, because John was careless in so doing.

(B) Relieve Henry of liability, because John's conduct was the immediate cause of Wanda's harm.

(C) Not relieve Henry of liability, because Henry's goal was achieved.

(D) Not relieve Henry of liability, because the conduct of a third person is irrelevant in emotional distress cases.

Questions 13-14 are based on the following fact situation:

Peter was rowing a boat on a mountain lake when a storm suddenly arose. Fearful that the boat might sink, Peter rowed to a boat dock on shore and tied the boat to the dock. The shore property and dock were the private property of Owner.

While the boat was tied at the dock, Owner came down and ordered Peter to remove the boat because the action of the waves was causing the boat to rub against a bumper on the dock. When Peter refused, Owner untied the boat and cast it adrift. The boat sank.

Peter was wearing a pair of swimming trunks and nothing else. He had a pair of shoes and a parka in the boat, but they were lost when Owner set it adrift. Peter was staying at a cabin one mile from Owner's property. The only land routes back were a short rocky trail that was dangerous during the storm, and a 15-mile road around the lake. The storm continued with heavy rain and hail, and Peter, having informed Owner of the location of his cabin, asked Owner to take him back there in Owner's car. Owner said, "You got here by yourself and you'll have to get back home yourself." After one hour the storm stopped, and Peter walked home over the trail. 13. A necessary element in determining if Peter is liable for a trespass is whether:

(A) Owner had clearly posted his property with a sign indicating that it was private property.

(B) Peter knew that the property belonged to a private person.

(C) Peter had reasonable grounds to believe the property belonged to a private person.

(D) Peter had reasonable grounds to believe his boat might be swamped and might sink.

14. If Peter asserts a claim against Owner for loss of the boat, the most likely result is that Owner will:
(A) Have no defense under the circum- stances.
(B) Prevail, because Peter was a trespasser ab initio.
(C) Prevail, because the boat might have damaged the dock.
(D) Prevail, because Peter became a trespasser when he refused to remove the boat.

Questions 15-16 are based on the following fact situation:

Dave is a six-year-old boy who has a welldeserved reputation for bullying younger and smaller children. His parents have encouraged him to be aggressive and tough. Dave, for no reason, knocked down, kicked, and severely injured Pete, a four-year-old. A claim has been asserted by Pete's parents for their medical and hospital costs and for Pete's injuries.

15. If the claim is asserted against Dave's parents, the most likely result is they will be: (A) Liable, because parents are strictly liable for the torts of their children.

(B) Liable, because Dave's parents encouraged him to be aggressive and tough.

(C) Not liable, because a child under seven is not liable in tort.

(D) Not liable, because parents cannot be held liable for the tort of a child.

16. If the claim is asserted against Dave, the most likely result is Dave will be:
(A) Liable, because he intentionally harmed Pete.
(B) Liable, because, as a six-year-old, he should have known his conduct was wrongful.
(C) Not liable, because a child under seven is not liable in tort.
(D) Not liable, because he is presumed to be under his parents' control and they have the sole responsibility.

Questions 17-18 are based on the following fact situation:

Mrs. Ritter, a widow, recently purchased a new uncrated electric range for her kitchen from Local Retailer. The range has a wide oven with a large oven door. The crate in which Stove Company, the manufacturer, shipped the range carried a warning label that the stove would tip over with a weight of 25 pounds or more on the oven door. Mrs. Ritter has one child-Brenda, age three. Recently, at about 5:30 p.m., Brenda was playing on the floor of the kitchen while Mrs. Ritter was heating water in a pan on the stove. The telephone rang and Mrs. Ritter went into the living room to answer it. While she was gone Brenda decided to find out what was cooking. She opened the oven door and climbed on it to see what was in the pan. Brenda's weight ( 25 pounds) on the door caused the stove to tip over forward. Brenda fell to the floor and the hot water spilled over her, burning her severely. Brenda screamed. Mrs. Ritter ran to the kitchen and immediately gave her first aid treatment for burns. Brenda thereafter received medical treatment.

Brenda's burns were painful. They have now healed and do not bother her, but she has ugly scars on her legs and back. Brenda's claim is asserted on her behalf by the proper party.

17. If Brenda asserts a claim based on strict liability against Local Retailer, she must establish that:

(A) Local Retailer did not inform Mrs. Ritter of the warning on the crate.

(B) The stove was substantially in the same condition at the time it tipped over as when it was purchased from Local Retailer.

(C) Local Retailer made some change in the stove design or had improperly assembled it so that it tipped over more easily.

(D) Local Retailer knew or should have known that the stove was dangerous because of the ease with which it tipped over.

18. If Brenda asserts a claim based on strict liability against Stove Company, she must establish that:
(A) The defendant negligently designed the stove.
(B) Stoves made by other manufacturers do not turn over with a 25-pound weight on the oven door.
(C) The defendant failed to warn the Ritters that the stove would turn over easily.
(D) The stove was defective and unreason- ably dangerous to her. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

\section{Question 19}

Paulsen was eating in a restaurant when he began to choke on a piece of food that had lodged in his throat. Dow, a physician who was sitting at a nearby table, did not wish to become involved and did not render any assistance, although prompt medical attention would have been effective in removing the obstruction from Paulsen's throat. Because of the failure to obtain prompt medical attention, Paulsen suffered severe brain injury from lack of oxygen.

If Paulsen asserts a claim against Dow for his injuries, will Paulsen prevail?

(A) Yes, if the jurisdiction relieves physicians of malpractice liability for emergency first aid.

(B) Yes, if a reasonably prudent person with Dow's experience, training, and knowledge would have assisted Paulsen.

(C) No, because Dow was not responsible for Paulsen's condition.

(D) No, unless Dow knew that Paulsen was substantially certain to sustain serious injury.

Questions 20-21 are based on the following fact situation:

Parents purchased a new mobile home from Seller. The mobile home was manufactured by Mobilco and had a ventilating system designed by Mobilco with both a heating unit and an air conditioner. Mobilco installed a furnace manufactured by Heatco and an air conditioning unit manufactured by Coolco. Each was controlled by an independent thermostat installed by Mobilco. Because of the manner in which Mobilco designed the ventilating system, the first time the ventilating system was operated by Parents, cold air was vented into Parents' bedroom to keep the temperature at $68^{\circ}$ $\mathrm{F}\left(20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. The cold air then activated the heater thermostat, and hot air was pumped into the bedroom of Child, the six-month-old child of Parents. The temperature in Child's room reached more than $170^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(77^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ before Child's mother became aware of the condition and shut the system off manually. As a result, Child suffered permanent physical injury.

Claims have been asserted by Child, through a duly appointed guardian, against Mobilco, Seller, Heatco, and Coolco.

20. If Child's claim against Seller is based on negligence, the minimum proof necessary to establish Seller's liability is that the ventilating system:

(A) Was defective.

(B) Was defective and had not been inspected by Seller.

(C) Was defective and had been inspected by Seller, and the defect was not discovered.

(D) Was defective, and the defect would have been discovered if Seller had exercised reasonable care in inspecting the system.

21. If Child's claims against Mobilco, Heatco, and Coolco are based on strict liability in tort, Child will probably recover against:

(A) Mobilco only, because the ventilating system was defectively designed by Mobilco.

(B) Heatco only, because it was the excessive heat from the furnace that caused Child's injuries.

(C) Mobilco and Heatco only, because the combination of Mobilco's design and Heatco's furnace caused Child's injuries.

(D) Mobilco, Heatco, and Coolco, because the combination of Mobilco's design, Heatco's furnace, and Coolco's air conditioning unit caused Child's injuries. 

\section{Question 22}

Hank owned a secondhand goods store. He often placed merchandise on the sidewalk, sometimes for short intervals, sometimes from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. Pedestrians from time to time stopped and gathered to look at the merchandise. Fred had moved into an apartment that was situated immediately above Hank's store; a street-level stairway entrance was located about 20 feet to the east. On several occasions, Fred had complained to Hank about the situation because not only were his view and peace of mind affected, but also his travel on the sidewalk was made more difficult. Fred owned and managed a restaurant two blocks to the west of his apartment and made frequent trips back and forth. There was a back entrance to his apartment through a parking lot; this entrance was about 200 feet farther in walking distance from his restaurant. Once Fred complained to the police, whereupon Hank was arrested under a local ordinance which prohibited the placing of goods or merchandise on public sidewalks and imposed, as its sole sanction, a fine for its violation.

One day, the sidewalk in front of Hank's store was unusually cluttered because he was cleaning and mopping the floor of his shop. Fred and his 15-year-old son, Steve, saw a bus they wished to take, and they raced down the stairs and onto the cluttered sidewalk in front of Hank's store, Fred in the lead. While dodging merchandise and people, Fred fell. Steve tripped over him and suffered a broken arm. Fred also suffered broken bones and was unable to attend to his duties for six weeks.

If, prior to the day of his personal injuries, Fred had asserted a claim based on public nuisance for injunctive relief against Hank for his obstruction of the sidewalk in violation of the ordinance, the defense on which Hank would have most likely prevailed is that:

(A) Fred consented to the obstruction by continuing to rent his apartment.

(B) The violation of the ordinance was not unreasonable. (C) Remedy of abatement by self-help was adequate.

(D) There was no claim for special damage.

\section{Question 23}

The city of Metropolis has an ordinance that makes it an offense, punishable by fine, for the owner of a dog to permit the dog to run unleashed on a public way.

Smythe, a police officer, observed a small dog running loose in the street. As Smythe picked the dog up, Nelson, who was seated in her car lawfully parked at the curb, called out, "Oh, thank you, Officer, for returning Fido." Smythe asked Nelson whether the dog was hers, and when she acknowledged ownership, he asked to see her driver's license. Nelson gave her name and address, but she refused to produce a driver's license. Smythe then told her to produce her driver's license if she did not want to go to jail. Nelson responded by saying, "Isn't this ridiculous?" Smythe took her by the arm and said, "Let's go. You are under arrest."'

Nelson cried out that Smythe was hurting her but he refused to release her arm, and she struck him with her free hand. Smythe then dragged Nelson from her car, forced her into his squad car, and took her to the police station.

The incident took place on the street in front of the apartment where Nelson and her aged father, Joplin, lived. Smythe did not know that Joplin had observed what took place from a window in the apartment.

If Nelson's father, Joplin, asserts a claim against Smythe for the intentional infliction of emotional distress, will Joplin prevail?

(A) Yes, if Smythe's acts caused Joplin severe emotional distress.

(B) Yes, if it is found that Smythe's behavior was extreme and outrageous with respect to Nelson. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

(C) No, because Smythe did not know that Joplin was watching.

(D) No, because Joplin was not within the zone of physical danger.

Questions 24-25 are based on the following fact situation:

Gasco owns a storage facility where flammable gases are stored in liquefied form under high pressure in large spherical tanks. The facility was constructed for Gasco by Acme Company, a firm that specializes in the construction of such facilities. After the facility had been in use for five years, an explosion in the facility started a large fire that blanketed the surrounding countryside with a high concentration of oily smoke and soot.

Farber owns a large truck farm near the facility. His entire lettuce crop was destroyed by oily deposits left by the smoke.

24. If Farber asserts a claim against Gasco for the loss of his lettuce crop and is unable to show any negligence on the part of Gasco, will Farber prevail?

(A) Yes, because the operation of the storage facility was an abnormally dangerous activity.

(B) Yes, because the intrusion of the smoke onto Farber's farm amounted to a trespass.

(C) No, if the explosion was caused by internal corrosion that reasonable inspection procedures would not have disclosed.

(D) No, if the explosion was caused by negligent construction on Acme's part.

25. If Farber asserts a claim against Acme Company for the loss of his lettuce crop, will Farber prevail?

(A) No, if Acme did not design the storage facility. (B) No, because Acme was an independent contractor.

(C) Yes, because the operation of the storage facility was an abnormally dangerous activity.

(D) Yes, if the explosion resulted from a defect of which Acme was aware.

\section{Question 26}

Siddon worked as a private duty nurse and on occasion worked in Doctors' Hospital. The hospital called Registry, the private duty referral agency through which Siddon usually obtained employment, and asked that in the future she not be assigned to patients in Doctors' Hospital.

Registry asked the hospital why it had made the request. Doctors' Hospital sent a letter to Registry giving as the reason for its request that significant amounts of narcotics had disappeared during Siddon's shifts from the nursing stations at which she had worked.

If Siddon asserts a claim based on defamation against Doctors' Hospital, Siddon will:

(A) Recover, because the hospital accused Siddon of improper professional conduct.

(B) Recover if Siddon did not take the narcotics.

(C) Not recover if narcotics disappeared during Siddon's shifts.

(D) Not recover if the hospital reasonably believed that Siddon took the narcotics.

\section{Question 27}

When Mary Weld visited Dugan's Alleys to participate in the weekly bowling league competition held there she brought her two-year-old son, Bobby, along and left him in a nursery provided by Dugan for the convenience of his customers. The children in the nursery were normally supervised by three attendants, but at this particular time, as Mary Weld knew, there was only one attendant present to care for about 20 children of assorted ages. About 30 minutes later, while the attendant was looking the other way, Bobby suddenly started to cry. The attendant found him lying on his back, picked him up, and called his mother. It was later discovered that Bobby had suffered a skull fracture.

If a claim is asserted against Dugan on Bobby's behalf, will Bobby prevail?

(A) Yes, because Dugan owed the child the highest degree of care.

(B) Yes, because a two-year-old is incapable of contributory negligence.

(C) No, unless Dugan or his employees failed to exercise reasonable care to assure

Bobby's safety.

(D) No, if Mary Weld assumed the risk by leaving Bobby in the nursery.

\section{Question 28}

Dever drove his car into an intersection and collided with a fire engine that had entered the intersection from Dever's right. The accident was caused by negligence on Dever's part. As a result of the accident, the fire engine was delayed in reaching Peters's house, which was entirely consumed by fire. Peters's house was located about 10 blocks from the scene of the accident.

If Peters asserts a claim against Dever, Peters will recover:

(A) That part of his loss that would have been prevented if the collision had not occurred.

(B) The value of his house before the fire.

(C) Nothing if Dever had nothing to do with causing the fire.

(D) Nothing, because Dever's conduct did not create an apparent danger to Peters.

\section{Question 29}

Purvis purchased a used car from Daley, a used-car dealer. Knowing them to be false, Daley made the following statements to Purvis prior to the sale:

Statement 1. This car has never been involved in an accident.

Statement 2. This car gets 25 miles to the gallon on the open highway.

Statement 3. This is as smooth-riding a car as you can get.

If Purvis asserts a claim against Daley based on deceit, which of the false statements made by Daley would support Purvis's claim?
(A) Statement 1. only.
(B) Statement 2. only.
(C) Statements 1. and 2. only.
(D) Statements 2. and 3. only.

\section{Question 30}

Customer, age 20 , went into Store at approximately 6:45 p.m. to look at some suits that were on sale. The clerks were busy, and one of them told him that he should wait on himself. Customer selected three suits from a rack and went into the dressing room to try them on. Signs posted on the walls of the Store state that closing time is 9 p.m.; however, because of a special awards banquet for employees, Store was closed at 7 p.m. on this day. The employees, in a hurry to get to the banquet, did not check the dressing rooms or turn off the lights before leaving. When Customer emerged from the dressing room a few minutes after 7 p.m., he was alone and locked in. Customer tried the front door but it was secured on the outside by a bar and padlock, so he went to the rear door. Customer grabbed the doorknob and vigorously shook the door. It did not open, but the activity set off a mechanism that had been installed because of several recent thefts committed by persons who 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

had hidden in the store until after closing time. The mechanism sprayed a chemical mist in Customer's face, causing him to become temporarily blind. The mechanism also activated an alarm carried by Store's employee, Watchman, who was just coming to work. Watchman unlocked the front door, ran into the store, and grabbed Customer. Customer, who was still unable to see, struck out at this person and hit a metal rack, injuring his hand. Watchman then identified himself, and Customer did the same. After assuring himself that Customer was telling the truth, Watchman allowed him to leave.

If Customer is to prevail on a claim against Store based on battery from the use of the chemical spray, Customer must establish that:

(A) He suffered severe bodily harm.

(B) The spray mist was an offensive or harmful contact.

(C) He suffered severe emotional distress.

(D) His conduct was not a factual cause of the chemical's spraying him.

\section{Question 31}

Dock had been the unsuccessful suitor of Mary, who had recently announced her engagement to Paul. Angered by her engagement, Dock sent Mary the following letter: "I hope you know what you are doing. The man you think you love wears women's clothes when at home. A Friend."

The receipt of this letter caused Mary great emotional distress. She hysterically telephoned Paul, read him the letter, and told him that she was breaking their engagement. The contents of the letter were not revealed to others. Paul, who was a young attorney in the state attorney's office, suffered serious humiliation and emotional distress as a result of the broken engagement.

If Paul asserts a claim against Dock based on defamation and it is proved that Dock's statement was true, such proof will be:
(A) A defense by itself.
(B) A defense only if Dock was not actuated by malice.
(C) A defense only if Dock reasonably believed it to be true.
(D) No defense by itself.

\section{Question 32}

Auto Company, a corporation, was a small dealer in big new cars and operated a service department. Peter wanted to ask Mike, the service manager, whether Auto Company would check the muffler on his small foreign car. Peter parked on the street near the service department with the intention of entering that part of the building by walking through one of the three large entrances designed for use by automobiles. There was no street entrance to the service department for individuals, and customers as well as company employees often used one of the automobile entrances.

As Peter reached the building, he glanced behind him to be sure no vehicle was approaching that entrance. Seeing none, he walked through the entrance, but immediately he was struck on the back of the head and neck by the large overhead door which was descending. The blow knocked Peter unconscious and caused permanent damage.

Peter did not know how the door was raised and lowered; however, the overhead door was operated by the use of either of two switches in the building. One switch was located in the office of the service manager and the other was located near the door in the service work area for the convenience of the mechanics. On this occasion, no one was in the service work area except three Auto Company mechanics. Mike, who had been in his office, and the three mechanics denied having touched a switch that would have lowered the door. Subsequent investigation showed, however, that the switches were working properly and that all of the mechanisms for moving the door were in good working order. If Peter asserts a claim based on negligence against Auto Company, Peter probably will:

(A) Recover, because Auto Company is strictly liable under the circumstances.

(B) Recover, because an employee of Auto Company was negligent.

(C) Not recover, because Peter was a licensee.

(D) Not recover, because Peter assumed the risk.

Questions 33-34 are based on the following fact situation:

Si was in the act of siphoning gasoline from Neighbor's car, in Neighbor's garage and without his consent, when the gasoline exploded and a fire followed. Rescuer, seeing the fire, grabbed a fire extinguisher from his car and put out the fire, saving Si's life and Neighbor's car and garage. In doing so, Rescuer was badly burned.

33. If Rescuer asserts a claim against $\mathrm{Si}$ for personal injuries, Rescuer will:

(A) Prevail, because he saved Si's life.

(B) Prevail, because Si was at fault in causing the fire.

(C) Not prevail, because Rescuer knowingly assumed the risk.

(D) Not prevail, because Rescuer's action was not a foreseeable consequence of Si's conduct. 34. If Rescuer asserts a claim against Neighbor for personal injuries, Rescuer will:
(A) Prevail, because he saved Neighbor's property.
(B) Prevail, because he acted reasonably in an emergency.
(C) Not prevail, because Neighbor was not at fault.
(D) Not prevail, because Rescuer know- ingly assumed the risk. 

\section{TORTS ANSWERS}

\section{Answer to Question 1}

(A) Because Steel had no notice that the product would cause eye injuries, an action against Steel must be predicated on strict liability, not negligence. The strict duty in such cases extends to any supplier in the distributive chain. Thus, if Steel, the manufacturer of the glue, is liable, then Paint Company, the retailer, may also be subject to liability. Conversely, if there is a determination that Steel did not manufacture an unreasonably dangerous product, then there will be no basis for holding the retailer liable. (B) is incorrect. It addresses Innes's status as a foreseeable victim of the fumes. However, it fails to address the basic issue of liability. Innes could be a foreseeable victim, yet she still must establish the unreasonably dangerous character of the product. (C) is incorrect because negligence is irrelevant to a strict liability action, which Innes can pursue against Paint Company as a commercial supplier. (D) is incorrect because the dangerous character of the glue emanates from its properties during use, not its packaging. The fact that Paint Company had no opportunity to inspect the product is irrelevant to its liability.

\section{Answer to Question 2}

(D) Innes probably cannot recover against Glass. An action against Glass would have to be based on the actions of its employees. Because it was not functioning as a commercial supplier in this case, it cannot be held liable on a strict liability theory. A successful action against it must be based on negligence. The employees had no notice of the dangerous character of the glue, nor were they even aware of the common ductwork. Therefore, a cause of action for negligence will not lie against the employees, and obviously will not lie against Glass. (A) is an incorrect statement of the law. (B) is incorrect. The employees did cause the fumes to enter Innes's area of the building. However, as has been shown, they were unaware of the damage the fumes could cause, or that they were sending fumes into the other area. (C) is incorrect because use of a product for its intended purpose does not negate the possibility of liability. If Glass's employees acted negligently while using the product for its intended purpose, Glass could be held vicariously liable for their actions.

\section{Answer to Question 3}

(C) Prout will not recover if Denton's conduct did not threaten immediate physical harm. A prima facie case for tortious assault requires that the defendant create a reasonable apprehension in the plaintiff of immediate harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff's person. Threats of future harm do not give rise to an action for assault. (A) is incorrect because mere intent to place in fear of physical harm is not enough. There must be a creation of reasonable apprehension of immediate harm. (B) is incorrect; extreme and outrageous conduct is an element of intentional infliction of emotional distress, but not of assault. (D) is incorrect because it is irrelevant, and later actions would not vitiate any threat of immediate harm.

\section{Answer to Question 4}

(A) Prout will recover if he suffered severe emotional distress. The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress requires: (i) an act by defendant amounting to extreme and outrageous conduct; (ii) intent to cause severe emotional distress or recklessness as to the effect of the conduct; (iii) causation; and (iv) damages. If Prout suffered severe emotional distress resulting from Denton's conduct (which was extreme and outrageous and, at the very least, reckless), he can recover from Denton. (B) is incorrect because intent, without more, does not establish intentional infliction of emotional distress. (C) is incorrect because immediate threat of physical harm is an element of assault rather than intentional infliction of emotional distress. (D) is 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

incorrect because, even though actual damages are required to win a case grounded on intentional infliction of emotional distress, physical injuries are not required.

\section{Answer to Question 5}

(C) Parker will not prevail because at common law Parker's contributory negligence will completely bar his right to recover. Parker was contributorily negligent because he was operating a car with defective brakes in violation of the statute. (A) is wrong because Parker was not in the class intended to be protected by the statute. It was Parker's obligation to ensure that the brakes complied with the statute. (B) is incorrect because the existence of an emergency, presenting little time for reflection, may be considered as among the circumstances under which the defendant acted (i.e., he must act as the reasonable person would act in the same emergency). Applying this criterion, Doctor was justified in moving the car. (D) is incorrect because a person who is injured while intoxicated does not automatically lose a cause of action against the person causing the injury. In addition, the harm in this case was not the type of harm which the drunk driving statute was designed to prevent.

\section{Answer to Question 6}

(A) (A) is correct because leaving the trench uncovered was the proximate cause of Tommy's death. Generally, rescuers are viewed as foreseeable intervening forces, and the original tortfeasor will be liable for their negligence. (B) is wrong as a matter of law. Construction companies are subject to strict liability based on the same criteria applied to other companies and individuals. The activity must be deemed "ultrahazardous" or "abnormally dangerous" to subject the party performing the activity to strict liability. Leaving the trench uncovered was negligent, but it is not ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous. (C) is wrong because under the attractive nuisance doctrine, the defendant had a duty to exercise ordinary care to avoid reasonably foreseeable harm to children caused by artificial conditions on the property. The fact that children played on the vacant lot made it possible for the defendant to anticipate infant trespassers. The defendant also knew of the dangerous condition, and the expense of covering the trench would be slight in comparison with the magnitude of the risk. (D) is incorrect, because even if the collapse of the trench was unforeseeable, Construction Company's conduct still threatened to cause injury, and most courts find liability where there is a foreseeable result of an unforeseeable cause.

\section{Answer to Question 7}

(D) The most significant factor pertains to the burden on Macco to eliminate the danger. Under the attractive nuisance doctrine, most courts impose on a landowner the duty to exercise ordinary care to avoid reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to children caused by artificial conditions on the property. To assess this special duty on the landowner, the plaintiff must show, among other things, that the expense of remedying the situation is slight compared with the magnitude of the risk. Choice (D) most closely reflects that requirement. (A) is incorrect because most jurisdictions no longer require that the child plaintiff be lured onto the property by the dangerous condition. Thus, whether the press was visible from a public way would only be relevant to show that the trespass was foreseeable, and here the facts indicate that the landowner was already aware that children played on the machinery. (B) and (C) are incorrect because the doctrine of attractive nuisance is distinct from nuisance law. The landowner may be liable even if the danger is neither a public nor a private nuisance as to adjoining landowners.

\section{Answer to Question 8}

(A) Accountant will recover because the dishwasher was defective. A prima facie products liability action based on strict liability in tort requires: (i) strict duty owed by a commercial supplier; (ii) breach of that duty; (iii) actual and proximate cause; and (iv) damages. Accountant can make such a case because he need not prove that the defendant was at fault in selling or producing a defective product-only that the product in fact is so defective as to be "unreasonably dangerous." The product also must have reached the user without substantial change in the condition in which it is supplied. The fact that the dishwasher had an internal wiring defect causing the machine to malfunction is a sufficient basis to impose strict liability. Any negligence by Contractor as an intermediary does not void the manufacturer's liability. Suppliers must anticipate reasonably foreseeable uses even if they are misuses. (B) is wrong because Contractor was an independent contractor with no relationship to Elex Company that vicarious liability would support. (C) is wrong even though assumption of risk may sometimes be successfully raised in strict liability cases. Here, Accountant did not know of the risk and did not voluntarily assume it. (D) is incorrect because privity is not required to bring a strict liability action. A majority of courts extend protection not only to buyers, but also to members of the buyer's family, guests, friends, and employees of the buyer, as well as foreseeable bystanders.

\section{Answer to Question 9}

(D) Absent a valid defense, a defendant may not cause a substantial, unreasonable interference with a neighbor's use or enjoyment of his property. Whether the Householders were there before or after Diner opened does not control the result; plaintiffs' right to the reasonable use or enjoyment of their land is the test. (A) is wrong because the fact that one type of land use was entered into before another is relevant but not conclusive evidence as to reasonableness of use. (B) is wrong because a use permitted under a zoning ordinance may be shown to be unreasonable. (C) is a misstatement of law.

\section{Answer to Question 10}

(C) Driver's injuries were actually caused by Trucker since they would not have occurred "but for" Trucker's negligent parking. Trucker was also the legal (proximate) cause of Driver's injuries. It was foreseeable that an eastbound car might proceed into the intersection when the traffic signal was obstructed and possibly collide with another car possessing the right of way-a foreseeable result caused by a foreseeable intervening force. Therefore, (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 11}

(B) Nothing in the facts indicates that City was under an absolute duty to maintain its traffic poles. Hence, (A) and (C) are incorrect. (D) states no legal theory for Driver's claim and so is not as good an answer as (B). The best theory for Driver is that City was negligent in not replacing the broken pole within 72 hours.

\section{Answer to Question 12}

(C) Henry intended to cause Wanda the severe emotional distress that did, in fact, result from his outrageous conduct. Hence, his conduct satisfies the prima facie case and (C) is the correct response. John's conduct was a foreseeable response to Henry's act and hence did not break the chain of causation leading to the result intended by Henry. Thus, (B) is wrong. (A) is unsupported by the facts, and (D) is a misstatement of law; if the third person's conduct was unforeseeable, it may affect the defendant's liability.

\section{Answer to Question 13}

(D) Although Peter intended to go onto Owner's property, his entry was privileged if Peter believed it was necessary to protect himself and/or his boat. Note that this privilege is qualified in that Peter 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

must pay for any damage he caused to Owner's property. (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because knowledge that the land is privately owned is irrelevant to the privilege of necessity.

\section{Answer to Question 14}

(A) The privilege to invade land as a private necessity supersedes the occupant's right to protect the property from invasion; hence, the landowner is liable to the invader for any harm suffered if entry is denied. (C) is wrong because Owner could have recovered for injury to his dock, but had no right to resist Peter's entry. (B) and (D) are incorrect because Peter's entry was privileged.

\section{Answer to Question 15}

(B) Parents may be liable for negligence for failing to prevent the tortious conduct of their children. Further, if parents know of their child's propensity to harm, they have a duty to exercise due care to control the child's behavior. Here, they did just the opposite. Hence, (D) is wrong. (C) is wrong because children are considered capable of committing torts. (A) is wrong because parents' liability is based on negligence.

\section{Answer to Question 16}

(A) A child is liable for his intentional torts whether or not he knows of their "wrongfulness." Hence, (B) is incorrect. (C) is wrong because there is no minimum age for capacity to commit torts.

Children generally are deemed to have the capacity to form the intent to commit intentional torts. (D) is wrong because parents are not vicariously liable for their children's torts.

\section{Answer to Question 17}

(B) Brenda must establish the facts in (B) because to hold the commercial supplier strictly liable for a product defect, the product must be expected to, and must in fact, reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is supplied. (A) is wrong because warnings are only one consideration in determining whether a product is in a "defective condition unreasonably dangerous" as required for strict liability purposes. Strict liability can apply even if the customer is informed of the warnings. (C) is wrong because it goes to an issue of negligence on the retailer's part. It is unnecessary for a retailer to affirmatively contribute to the defectiveness of the product for strict liability to apply. (See the analysis of option (B), above.) (D) is incorrect because in a strict liability case it is unnecessary to prove that the defendant was at fault in selling or producing a dangerous product-only that the product is in fact so defective as to be unreasonably dangerous. Thus, plaintiff need not show that Local Retailer was aware or should have been aware of the danger. Options (A), (C), and (D) all deal with fault on Local Retailer's part, and are, therefore, wrong in a strict liability analysis.

\section{Answer to Question 18}

(D) Brenda must show that the stove had an unreasonably dangerous defect to establish a breach of duty by the manufacturer. To establish a prima facie case based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff must prove: (i) strict duty owed by a commercial supplier; (ii) breach of that duty; (iii) actual and proximate cause; and (iv) damages. To establish breach of duty for a strict liability action, the plaintiff need not prove that the defendant was at fault in selling or producing a dangerous product $-$ only that the product in fact is so defective as to be "unreasonably dangerous." (A) is wrong because negligence need not be proven in a strict liability case. (B) is wrong because the availability of safer product alternatives is only one factor to be considered by the courts in determining whether a product is defective. $(\mathrm{C})$ is incorrect because even though the warnings may well have been inadequate because they were placed on the crate rather than on the stove itself, the role of instructions and warnings is but one of many factors the courts will consider in determining the defective nature of a given product.

\section{Answer to Question 19}

(C) At issue is Dow's duty to Paulsen. Generally, the law imposes no duty to affirmatively act for the benefit of others. There are exceptions to this rule-e.g., one who places another in a position of peril must use reasonable care to aid that person; one who gratuitously acts for the benefit of another thereby assumes a duty to act like an ordinary reasonable person. None of the exceptions is applicable to the case at bar. Therefore, (B) and (D) are clearly incorrect. The "Good Samaritan" statute, described in (A), generally exempts from liability medical personnel who voluntarily and gratuitously render emergency treatment. However, it does not require them to provide such treatment. Thus, (A) is incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 20}

(D) Under a negligence analysis, the defendant's conduct must fall below the standard of care expected of a reasonable person under like circumstances. In the instant case, Seller had a duty, at the time of transfer of possession of the home to Parents, to disclose concealed, unreasonably dangerous conditions, of which he knew or had reason to know, and of which he knew Parents were ignorant and not likely to discover on reasonable inspection. Thus, if Seller did not know of a defect in the ventilating system, and could not have discovered the defect through reasonable care, a cause of action for negligence would not lie. (B) and (C) imply that Seller would be liable in negligence merely for failure to inspect or for failure to discover the defect upon inspection. However, there must also be a showing that a reasonable inspection would have disclosed the defect. Consequently, (B) and (C) are incorrect. (A) is more appropriate to a strict liability case, since it does not even mention the necessity for knowledge or discovery of the defect. Therefore, it is an incorrect alternative.

\section{Answer to Question 21}

(A) The issue is causation. But for Mobilco's defective design of the ventilating system, the injury to Child would not have occurred. Since Child can trace the injury to a defect in the ventilating system that existed when it left Mobilco's control, cause in fact is established. The same concepts of proximate cause which govern negligence actions are applicable to strict liability actions for defective products. Child's injury is the direct result of Mobilco's defective design, which is the cause in fact of the injury. Thus, proximate cause is established. Heatco's furnace and Coolco's air conditioning unit contained no defects and did not cause injury to Child. As the facts make clear, both units were controlled by a thermostat independent of the units themselves. Thus, (B), (C), and (D) are incorrect.

\section{Answer to Question 22}

(D) Hank would prevail in the absence of a claim for special damage. Public nuisance is an act that unreasonably interferes with the health, safety, or property rights of the community. Recovery is available for public nuisance only if a private party has suffered some unique damage not suffered by the public at large. Thus, without a claim of special damage by Fred, Hank would be able to defend against Fred's public nuisance suit. (A) is wrong because it is a form of the largely 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

discredited "coming to the nuisance" defense. Fred is entitled to the reasonable use and enjoyment of his leasehold. Remaining in the apartment does not constitute "consent." (B) is incorrect because the ordinance is enforceable against Hank even if his violation is "reasonable." This option is a "distractor," designed to lure you into wrongfully applying the "unreasonable interference" test from private nuisance cases. (C) is incorrect because only one who has suffered some unique damage has a privilege to abate a public nuisance by self-help. In the absence of such unique damage, a public nuisance may be abated or enjoined only by public authority.

\section{Answer to Question 23}

(C) Where the defendant intentionally causes severe physical harm to one person, and another person suffers severe emotional distress because of that person's relationship to the injured party, problems of intent and causation arise. To sustain a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress under such circumstances, the plaintiff generally must show: (i) he was present when the injury occurred to the other person; (ii) he is a close relation of the injured person; and (iii) the defendant knew that the plaintiff was present and a close relation to the injured person. In the case at bar, we do not know that Nelson suffered severe physical harm. However, we do know that Smythe was unaware that Joplin observed the incident. (A) and (B) are incorrect, because they ignore the issue of whether Smythe knew that Joplin was watching. (D) is incorrect, because the term "zone of physical danger" is more appropriate to an action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

\section{Answer to Question 24}

(A) An activity may be characterized as ultrahazardous if it (i) involves a substantial risk of serious harm to person or property; (ii) cannot be performed without risk of serious harm no matter how much care is taken; and (iii) is not a commonly engaged-in activity in the particular community. In such cases, the duty owed is an absolute duty to make safe the ultrahazardous condition. Liability will be imposed for any injuries to persons or property resulting from the condition. Pursuant to the foregoing criteria, Gasco's operation of the storage facility constitutes an abnormally dangerous activity, subjecting Gasco to liability for damage caused by the explosion, regardless of any negligence on the part of Gasco. Thus, (C) is incorrect. (D) is incorrect because any negligence on the part of Acme will not absolve Gasco of liability for maintenance of an ultrahazardous condition. (B) is incorrect because where, as here, no physical object enters the plaintiff's land, a court will generally treat the matter as a nuisance case or one involving strict liability if ultrahazardous activity is involved, rather than as a trespass case.

\section{Answer to Question 25}

(D) Acme, as the manufacturer of the facility, owed a duty of due care to any foreseeable plaintiff. Farber, whose farm is located near the facility, is a foreseeable plaintiff. Therefore, if the explosion resulted from a defect of which Acme was aware, Acme would be liable to Farber for the resultant loss of his lettuce crop. (B) is incorrect because Acme's status as an independent contractor relative to Gasco has no bearing on the duty owed by Acme to Farber. (A) is incorrect because Acme will be liable for manufacturing the facility with knowledge of a defect, regardless of the identity of the facility's designer. (C) is incorrect because Acme was the manufacturer, rather than the operator, of the facility.

\section{Answer to Question 26}

(D) In a defamation action, a defendant may assert a claim of qualified privilege for statements made in the interest of the publisher of the statement, the recipient of the statement, or both. The privilege will be lost only if the statement is not within the scope of the privilege or if it was made with malice (i.e., knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity). In this case, Hospital's response to Registry on a matter of common interest was within the scope of the privilege. Thus, (D) is correct because Hospital's reasonable belief would negate any malice on its part. (A) is incorrect, because the accusation alone does not establish defamation when a claim of qualified privilege is raised. (B) is incorrect, because the falsity of the statement does not dispose of the question of qualified privilege. $(\mathrm{C})$ is incorrect, because the disappearance of the narcotics does not, by itself, establish a reasonable belief on the part of the hospital that Siddon was responsible for the disappearance.

\section{Answer to Question 27}

(C) (A) is incorrect because Dugan owed the child the duty to act as an ordinary, prudent, reasonable person-not the "highest degree of care." (B) is incorrect because, even if a two-year-old were incapable of contributory negligence, the plaintiff could prevail only if the defendant or his employees were negligent-i.e., failed to exercise reasonable care to ensure the plaintiff's safety. Because (C) reflects this principle, it is the correct answer. (D) is incorrect because, even if Mary assumed the risk, the mother's assumption of risk will not be imputed to the plaintiff-child.

\section{Answer to Question 28}

(A) In negligently causing the collision with the fire engine, it was foreseeable that Dever's actions could cause injury to someone else (e.g., a local resident who the fire engine would be unable to reach because of the accident). Peters, whose house was located only 10 blocks from the scene of the accident, falls within the foreseeable zone of danger. It follows that (D) is incorrect. (C) is incorrect because, even if Dever was not involved in causing the fire, his negligence caused the delay in the arrival of the fire engine. In turn, this delay may well have caused all or part of the damage suffered by Peters. (B) is incorrect because it assumes, without a factual basis, that Dever's negligence caused the entire loss. (A) is correct because it recognizes that Dever breached a duty of due care owed to Peters, and that Dever will be liable for that part of Peters's damages that was actually and proximately caused by Dever's breach of duty.

\section{Answer to Question 29}

(C) A cause of action for deceit requires: (i) a false representation of a material past or present fact; (ii) scienter; (iii) intent to induce reliance; (iv) causation; (v) justifiable reliance; and (vi) damages. Generally, reliance upon false statements of opinion, value, or quality is unjustified. Here, Daley's statements regarding the car's not having been involved in an accident and the gasoline mileage constitute knowingly false representations of material fact that will form the basis of a cause of action for deceit. Thus, statements 1. and 2. are correct. Statement 3., regarding the smooth ride of the car, is an opinion, upon which Purvis would not be justified in relying. Consequently, statement 3 . would not support Purvis's claim for deceit. Therefore, (C) is correct, and (A), (B), and (D) are wrong.

\section{Answer to Question 30}

(B) In order to establish a prima facie case for battery, Customer must show (i) an act by the defendant Store that brings about harmful or offensive contact to Customer's person, (ii) intent by Store to bring about such contact, and (iii) causation. (B) is correct since this is one of the elements necessary to establish a battery. (A) is wrong because there need not be severe bodily harm for a battery to occur. The contact may be merely offensive without causing any bodily injury. 

\section{RELEASED QUESTIONS}

(C) is wrong because there need not be any emotional distress for a battery to occur. (D) is wrong because Customer's conduct of vigorously shaking the door was indeed the factual cause of the spray. However, there was causation on the Store's part in the sense of the Store having set in motion a force that would bring about a harmful or offensive contact to Customer's person where there was any attempt to open the door.

\section{Answer to Question 31}

(A) Truth is an absolute defense to a claim of defamation. (B) is wrong because it is irrelevant whether Dock made the statement out of malice as long as the statement was in fact true. (C) is wrong because it is equally irrelevant whether Dock reasonably believed the statement to be true. The fact that the statement is true is the only requirement for the defense to prevail. (D) is wrong for the reason that (A) is correct. Note that Paul's claim is based on defamation. Even though Dock can defend the defamation action by showing that the statement is true, Paul might nonetheless be able to successfully assert a cause of action based on intentional infliction of emotional distress.

\section{Answer to Question 32}

(B) (B) is correct because res ipsa loquitur applies. When the facts are such as to strongly indicate that the plaintiff's injuries resulted from the defendant's negligence, the trier of fact may be permitted to infer the defendant's liability. The circumstantial evidence doctrine of res ipsa loquitur requires the plaintiff to show: (i) the accident causing his injury is of the type that would not normally occur unless someone was negligent; (ii) the negligence was attributable to the defendant; and (iii) the plaintiff was free from negligence. All of these elements are satisfied from the facts of this case. Because the switches and the doors were found to be in good working order, the injury can reasonably be inferred to be attributable to one of Auto Company's employees, because they had access to the switches. (A) is wrong because strict liability applies to ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous activities that cannot be performed without risk of serious harm no matter how much care is taken. The operation of the door cannot be characterized as ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous. (C) is incorrect because the owner has a duty to exercise reasonable care in the conduct of "active operations" (such as opening and closing the door) for the protection of licensees known to be on the property. (D) is incorrect because to have assumed the risk, the plaintiff must have known of the risk and voluntarily assumed it. Peter had no reason to know of any risk involving the overhead door and consequently could not assume it.

\section{Answer to Question 33}

(B) It is foreseeable that where a defendant's wrongful conduct places him in a position of peril, a rescuer may suffer injuries while reasonably attempting to aid him, i.e., "danger invites rescue." Hence, $(B)$ is correct and $(D)$ is incorrect. (C) is wrong because a rescue is not a "voluntary" assumption of the risk. (A) is not a reason for imposing liability.

\section{Answer to Question 34}

(C) Since Neighbor's conduct did not endanger Si, Neighbor owed no duty to Si or his rescuer. Generally, there is no duty owed to an undiscovered trespasser such as $\mathrm{Si}$, whose conduct was unforeseeable. (A) and (B) are wrong because the facts that Rescuer acted reasonably or saved Neighbor's property are irrelevant to the issue of Neighbor's duty. (D) is wrong because an act of rescue is not an assumption of the risk.
