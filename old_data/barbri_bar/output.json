            "Problem Statement": "St. Minny, a town with a population of 30,000 , was located on the west bank of a small river. Immediately across the river, on the east bank, was Paulopolis, a city of 60,000 . Over the years, many civic improvement groups urged that the two municipalities be merged into \"Minnypaulos,\" a single city of 90,000 souls. The arguments in favor of merger stressed savings to taxpayers accruing from the elimination of duplicate services. Proposals to merge the two places had appeared as referenda on the ballot on two separate occasions. Although the voters of Paulopolis approved each proposal by heavy margins, the voters of St. Minny, fearing that control of the government would be in the hands of more populous Paulopolis, rejected the referendum proposals by more than two to one.\n\nTo avoid the failure of yet another such referendum, a new proposal was made for the governance of the proposed combined city. For a period of 20 years, beginning at the date of the merger, the city council of the merged city would consist of six persons. The former Paulopolis would be divided into three council districts, as would the former city of St. Minny. Thus, each St. Minny council representative would be elected from a district with a population of 10,000, while the Paulopolis districts would contain 20,000 persons each. A mayor would be elected at large. The proposal was placed on the ballot and was carried by large majorities in both St. Minny and Paulopolis. Representatives from Paulopolis and St. Minny carved each former city into three council electoral districts. Three Paulopolis taxpayers filed suit to enjoin the holding of an election with council districts of such disparate proportions.\n\nWhich of the following represents the plaintiffs' best constitutional argument?",

Therefore, it decreed in the legislation that all counseling would be free for single mothers with an income of less than $ 20,000$ per year. Others would have to pay fees for the counseling on a sliding scale depending upon income. The counseling services available at the State Family Counseling Centers included classes on parenting, anti-substance abuse programs, and financial counseling. The counseling centers were popular and other states considered copying the Margate model.\n\nPeter's wife had died recently of a drug overdose, and he was left to care for their two children (ages two and four) on an income of approximately $ 7,000$ per year.

He heard about the State Family Counseling Centers and went to the closest one for financial counseling. Peter was told that he would have to pay a $ 50$ fee for the counseling.

Peter became very angry when he learned that single mothers in his situation were entitled to free counseling while single fathers were not.

            "Problem Statement": "The state of Petrolia derived most of its income from extractive industries, especially its extensive oil and natural gas fields. However, a worldwide drop in the price of petroleum was severe enough to cause a depression in Petrolia, and the state's unemployment rate soared. To counter the effect the depression was having on Petrolia's citizens, the state legislature passed a law requiring all employers operating in the state's oil and natural gas fields to give preference in hiring to residents of Petrolia. The bill banned the hiring of nonresidents unless no other qualified person could be found to fill an oilfield or natural gas field position. Under prevailing economic conditions, the statute was tantamount to a total ban on hiring of nonresidents because so many unemployed oil and gas workers had been created by the depression and little new exploration was taking place.\n\n\"Roughnecks,\" as oilfield workers call themselves, tend to be an itinerant lot, moving from place to place as new fields are brought into production. Driller was a 48-year-old roughneck whose permanent residence was in Louisiana. He had worked on offshore rigs in the Gulf waters off his home state, but Driller had also worked in Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska, Kuwait, Indonesia, and Venezuela. Upon hearing that one of the few independent companies actively exploring in Petrolia had struck a new field in that state, Driller drove to the field office of Ewing Exploration Company in Petrolia and applied for a job. Looking at Driller's extensive experience as described on Driller's resume, Ewing's personnel officer sadly shook his head. He indicated that Driller's qualifications were better than anyone's working in the field, but that he had more applications from experienced Petrolia residents than he had jobs to offer.

Bob, decided that the state legislature would serve as an effective pulpit for his religious views by giving him a great deal of media exposure and direct mail resources. The state of Plains had no provision barring members of the clergy from serving as legislators. Bob entered a race that already had several other candidates and took advantage of the state's liberal voter registration laws by having many of his followers move into the district a month before the election. Bob's subsequent victory in the race shocked the political establishment and prompted a citizens' group to file a lawsuit in federal district court.

The moment occurred at a large outdoor barbecue celebrating Melissa's birthday. At the barbecue, Dorothy gave the gun to Melissa's 10-year-old nephew, Sammy. She told Sammy, \"Why don't you go up and point this gun at your Auntie Melissa. When you pull the trigger a sign will come out saying, 'BANG! and Happy Birthday,' just like in the circus.\" Sammy took the gun, pointed it at Melissa, and pulled the trigger. However, Sammy's aim was faulty, and when the gun discharged the bullet struck Hank, killing him. The police quickly linked Dorothy to the crime.\n\nWhich of the following best describes the crime or crimes of which Dorothy can be properly convicted?",

Dan was not asked to pay in this manner, but he did it as a matter of custom. Dan did this for four weeks, and then the opposing party suddenly made a generous settlement offer which Dan's client agreed to accept. On a Thursday morning, before checkout time for that day, Dan tendered the hotel cashier a check for $ 400$ plus additional charges incurred from Sunday through Wednesday nights. The cashier promptly took the check and then told Dan, \"You owe us $ 1,000$ plus taxes for 10 more days' lodging. We expect you to pay for the rest of this week as you customarily do, and then for an additional week because you didn't give us a week's notice that you planned to vacate.\" Dan refused to pay the additional charges. If the hotel sues Dan and the court determines that the parties created a tenancy, for how many additional days' lodging will he be required to pay?",

Seventeen years ago, Wallace purchased Woodlot, which is adjacent to Smoothacre and Roughacre. At the time Wallace purchased Woodlot, he asked Arnold, the owner of Smoothacre, if Arnold would grant Wallace an easement to use the paved way across Smoothacre to haul logs to the public road. Arnold was an affable person and he readily granted the easement to Wallace. Wallace paid nothing for the easement, and the deed granting the easement was properly recorded in the office of the county recorder of deeds. For six months Wallace hauled $\\operatorname{logs}$ across Smoothacre. However, Wallace decided it would be easier to haul the logs over Roughacre, because the distance to the public road was less using that route. Wallace negotiated with Brenda, the owner of Roughacre, and Brenda granted Wallace a license to haul logs on the gravel road across Roughacre to the public road. Wallace paid Brenda a modest annual fee for this privilege. In the intervening time period, Wallace never used the paved way across Smoothacre for any purpose. Six months ago, Arnold conveyed Smoothacre to Cyd, and two weeks ago, Cyd had a chain-link fence built around the perimeter of Smoothacre which, of course, blocked Wallace's access to the paved way crossing Smoothacre. One week ago, acting within her rights, Brenda revoked Wallace's license to use the gravel road crossing Roughacre. The next day, Wallace told Cyd, \"Open up that chainlink fence where Smoothacre abuts Woodlot, because I have an easement to haul my logs across your paved way.\" Cyd replied, \"Forget it, Buster. I never agreed to any easement, and I don't want you hauling logs across my property.\" Wallace seeks advice about his rights in the easement across Smoothacre.\n\nWhich of the following best represents Wallace's rights under the circumstances?",

Not wanting to lose control of the family property forever, Oiler inserted a provision in the deed to Astro binding \"Astro, his heirs, and assigns\" to offer \"Oiler, his heirs, and assigns\" the right of first refusal to purchase Cattlefork when it was offered for sale. Astro was not happy with the provision, but Oiler refused to sell the property without the covenant included. Astro reluctantly agreed. Cattlefork was conveyed to Astro, and the deed containing the right of first refusal was duly recorded.\n\nAstro lived on Cattlefork for 23 years. His dislike for Oiler was so great that he did not want Oiler to ever get the property back. Therefore, Astro devised a stratagem to get around the covenant. When informed that Cowboy was interested in buying the property, Astro decided to execute his plan. Astro's friend Ranger agreed to act as a \"straw man\" to avoid the consequences of the covenant.

Pansy was peacefully walking along a quiet residential street in Kirbyville. It happened to be the same street as that along which Dietz was walking. Pansy noticed that a person was walking up the street on the sidewalk towards her, but she did not know Dietz. When Dietz saw Pansy approaching him, he pulled a softdrink bottle from his shopping bag and hurled it at Pansy, striking her in the head and causing her injury. Afterwards Pansy filed a civil battery action against Dietz.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, provides the best defense for Dietz?",

She expected that strait-laced Paul would have a minor vision or two and act in a goofy and comical manner.

The emergency room physician, Pillpush, was very busy and negligently released Paul prematurely.

Be informed that we will be unable to ship the additional 60 suits you requested at this time or at any time during this year's beach season.\" Trendee took the 40 suits, put them on their salesracks, and began to sell them. Trendee immediately sought an alternate supplier of swimsuits. The best price it could obtain was $ 11$ per suit from Flying Fish Industries.

A week later, WidgeCo had sent no additional communication to Distrucorp.\n\nAssuming no additional facts, what is the relationship between the parties?\n\n(A) There is no contract between WidgeCo and Distrucorp, because Distrucorp made a material alteration.\n\n(B) There is a valid, enforceable contract between WidgeCo and Distrucorp, but it is limited to the terms of WidgeCo's offer.\n\n(C) There is a valid, enforceable contract between WidgeCo and Distrucorp, and it contains the additional term because WidgeCo raised no objection.\n\n(D) Distrucorp has sent a valid counteroffer to WidgeCo, which WidgeCo can accept or reject. \n\n\\section{CONTRACTS}\n\n\\section{Question 15}\n\nTekmart, a leading computer supply retailer, contacted Megabyte, a manufacturer of blank diskettes, on October 25 to supplement the supply of diskettes at Tekmart's area stores. In response, Megabyte offered to supply 50 cartons of boxed diskettes at $ 200$ a carton, for a total price of $ 10,000$, delivery one week after acceptance, and sent a letter containing those contractual terms to Tekmart on October 26 . The president of Tekmart signed the letter on October 27 without making any changes to it and sent it back to Megabyte by first class mail. The next day, having not heard from Tekmart, Megabyte's sales manager contacted the president of Tekmart and informed him that, if Tekmart accepted by the end of the month, it would receive a $1 \\%$ discount in the total price. When Tekmart's president responded that he had already sent the acceptance, the sales manager assured him that the discount would still apply. On October 31, Tekmart received a circular from Dataco offering comparable diskettes for $5 \\%$ less than Megabyte's price. The president of Tekmart immediately faxed a rejection to Megabyte. Megabyte received the rejection immediately but took no action on it. The next day, November 1, Megabyte received the signed contract from Tekmart. What is the status of the agreement between the parties?\n\n(A) An enforceable contract was formed for $ 9,900$ because Tekmart accepted before October 31 and needed no additional consideration for the oral modification.\n\n(B) An enforceable contract was formed for $ 10,000$ because the parol evidence rule precludes Tekmart from offering evidence of the telephone conversation.\n\n(C) An enforceable contract was formed for $ 10,000$ because, even though Tekmart accepted before October 31 , the Statute of Frauds makes the oral modification between the parties unenforceable.\n\n(D) An enforceable contract was not formed between the parties because Tekmart's rejection was received before its acceptance. \n\n\\section{Question 16}\n\nTommy was in his third year of college, and Tommy's father, Dad, often sent Tommy money to help Tommy pay for books and for living expenses. During the last winter break, Tommy brought his girlfriend Gidget home to meet his family. Dad took an instant dislike to Gidget, and has continually lectured Tommy about her, insisting that Tommy could find someone \"more refined\" to date.\n\nIn early March, Tommy telephoned Dad from College Village, where the university was located. Tommy asked Dad for $ 1,000$. Dad told Tommy, \"I'll send you the thousand bucks, but if you don't find a classier girlfriend than that Gidget person, this is the last subsidy you'll get from me, young man.\" Tommy thanked Dad, and promptly went to a jeweler with Gidget, where Tommy and Gidget selected an engagement ring priced at $ 5,000$. Tommy, who was 21 years of age, signed a contract to purchase the ring. The contract required Tommy to make a $1,000 down payment and then to make a series of installment payments. Tommy planned to use the $ 1,000$ check he was expecting from Dad for the down payment. Tommy and Gidget both worked at part-time, minimum wage jobs while they attended school. Through a friend who lived in College Village, Dad discovered Tommy's plan to buy Gidget an expensive engagement ring. Dad refused to send Tommy the $ 1,000$ check. The jeweler is now demanding that Tommy make the $ 1,000$ down payment on the ring and pay the first installment as well. Can Tommy legally enforce Dad's promise to send Tommy $ 1,000$ ?\n(A) Yes, because Tommy relied on Dad's promise and the doctrine of promissory estoppel applies.\n(B) Yes, because Tommy was an intended beneficiary.\n(C) No, because Dad's promise was a gift unsupported by consideration.\n(D) No, because Dad did not promise to send the money with the expectation of inducing Tommy to buy an engagement ring for Gidget. \n\n\\section{CONTRACTS}\n\n\\section{Question 17}\n\nEllen owns a high-style ladies' fashion store in Beverly Hills. Calvin is the designer and manufacturer of a world-famous line of original gowns.\n\nOn April 1, Ellen and Calvin signed a written agreement wherein Ellen was appointed the \"sole and exclusive\" retail distributor for Calvin's clothes in Beverly Hills. The contract provided that Calvin was to have the absolute right to cease doing business with Ellen \"at any time and for any reasons Calvin chooses.\"\n\nOn May 1, Ellen handed Calvin a written order for $ 50,000$ worth of his original gowns, to be delivered to Ellen on September 1. Calvin did not sign an acknowledgment of Ellen's order, but in her presence he set aside the originals designated in her order by putting her name on them.\n\nTo publicize her new line of merchandise, Ellen conducted a large advertising campaign announcing to the Beverly Hills public that she would have a wide selection of Calvin's originals on display on September 1. She also made substantial improvements to the store to display these clothes in lush and expensive settings.\n\nOn August 15 , Calvin wired Ellen, \"Sorry, darling, I have to invoke my right to terminate our arrangement. Your competitor in Beverly Hills, Shannon, has made an offer for the clothes you ordered that I simply couldn't pass up. I know you'll understand. Best wishes, Calvin.\"\n\nUpon receipt of the message, Ellen filed suit against Calvin. Calvin defends on the ground that his April 1 agreement with Ellen is unenforceable for lack of consideration because Ellen did not obligate herself under the contract in any way. How should the court rule on that issue?\n(A) Any want of consideration at the formation stage was cured by Ellen's actual tender of a large order.\n(B) The April agreement was, in effect, a \"firm offer\" between merchants and hence binding on both parties even though there was no consideration.\n(C) There was sufficient consideration in Ellen's implied promise to exercise her best efforts to promote the sale of Calvin's gowns.\n(D) Calvin set aside the gowns in Ellen's presence, and thereby apparently expressed his willingness to ship as per her order. \n\n\\section{(b)oror}\n\nBAR REVIEW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Criminal Law}\n\n\\section{Question 1}\n\nDorothy's very best friend was Melissa, and Dorothy shared all of her secrets with her. Dorothy and her husband, Hank, often brought Melissa, a divorcee, along on vacations and dining engagements. One day, however, after being tipped off by a mutual friend, Dorothy went through Hank's drawer and discovered steamy love letters to him from Melissa. The tone of the letters made it obvious that Hank and Melissa had been having an affair for at least three years. Dorothy became furious, but kept repeating to herself, \"Don't get mad, get even!\" She purchased a handgun and waited for the right moment to use it. The moment occurred at a large outdoor barbecue celebrating Melissa's birthday. At the barbecue, Dorothy gave the gun to Melissa's 10-year-old nephew, Sammy. She told Sammy, \"Why don't you go up and point this gun at your Auntie Melissa. When you pull the trigger a sign will come out saying, 'BANG! and Happy Birthday,' just like in the circus.\" Sammy took the gun, pointed it at Melissa, and pulled the trigger. However, Sammy's aim was faulty, and when the gun discharged the bullet struck Hank, killing him. The police quickly linked Dorothy to the crime.\n\nWhich of the following best describes the crime or crimes of which Dorothy can be properly convicted?\n\n(A) Murder of Hank and attempted murder of Melissa.\n\n(B) Murder of Hank, but not attempted murder of Melissa.\n\n(C) Attempted murder of Melissa, but not murder of Hank.\n\n(D) Attempted murder of Melissa or murder of Hank, but not both.\n\n\\section{Question 2}\n\nHoward was supposed to be out of town on a three-day business trip. Because he completed his business more quickly than expected, he flew home on Wednesday night instead of Thursday afternoon. Howard arrived home and let himself into the house. He heard noises from the bedroom and, upon investigation, Howard was shocked to find his wife, Chastity, in bed with Nick, a good friend of Howard, who lived four blocks away. Nick dressed quickly and took off out the back door. Howard screamed a number of epithets at Chastity and then told her, \"Nick's going to pay for this! Get me a drink! It will give me the steadiness to do what I have to do to avenge my honor.\" A frightened Chastity brought Howard a bourbon and water. Howard drank it quickly and demanded yet another drink. After consuming several more drinks, Howard unlocked the closet, pulled out a rifle, and loaded it. He then set off for Nick's house.\n\nHoward arrived at Nick's about 10 minutes later. Nick had neglected to lock his front door, so Howard walked in. He found a trembling Nick in the living room, and Howard pointed the gun at him. Nick immediately began apologizing, blaming the affair on Chastity, and pleading for his life. Howard stood silently listening to Nick, but he kept the gun trained on his erstwhile friend. Suddenly, Nick pulled a switchblade knife from his pocket. As the metal flashed, Howard fired a single shot at Nick. The bullet struck him in the middle of the forehead and Nick died instantly. Howard set the gun down, fell to his knees, and began crying. A neighbor who heard the shot reported it to the police. They arrived a few minutes later and found a distraught Howard muttering about losing a friend and a marriage in one night.\n\nHoward can be convicted of:\n(A) Murder.\n(B) Manslaughter, because Howard was still distraught over finding Nick in bed with Chastity.\n(C) Manslaughter, because his intoxication prevented Howard from having the requi- site intent for murder.\n(D) No homicide crime, because Nick was about to attack him with a knife. \n\n\\section{CRIMINAL LAW}\n\n\\section{Question 3}\n\nLarry was passing by a house under construction when he noticed that the ladder being used by workers on the roof had copper braces supporting the rungs. After making sure that the workers on the roof could not see him, Larry used a pliers that he had in his pocket to remove all of the copper braces that he could reach from the ground. A short time later, Vernon climbed down the ladder and it collapsed. He fell to the ground and severely injured his back. Larry was apprehended a few hours later trying to sell the copper for scrap.\n\nA statute in the jurisdiction makes it a felony for \"maliciously causing serious physical injury to another.\" Larry was charged with malicious injury under the statute and was also charged with larceny. After a jury trial in which the above facts were presented, he was convicted of both charges.\n\nIf Larry appeals the conviction for the malicious injury charge on grounds of insufficient evidence, how should the court rule?\n\n(A) Affirm the conviction, because Larry was engaged in criminal conduct at the time of the act that resulted in the injury.\n\n(B) Affirm the conviction, because the jury could have found that Larry acted with malice.\n\n(C) Reverse the conviction, because there was no evidence that Larry intended to injure anyone.\n\n(D) Reverse the conviction, because there was no evidence that Larry bore any malice towards Vernon or the other workers on the roof.\n\n\\section{Question 4}\n\nVictor was desperately ill with a particularly virulent and painful form of cancer. He was permanently hospitalized and quite helpless as the killer disease tore at his vitals. Victor's daughter, Dana, was devoted to her dad. She visited him every evening in the hospital and spent many hours with him on the weekends. For over two months, Victor pleaded with Dana, \"Please kill me and put me out of my misery. I'm in such terrible pain. The pangs of Hell couldn't be any worse than this!\" Every day or evening that Dana visited, Victor would renew his plea to be killed. The staff doctors and nurses had often heard Victor's plaint. One Saturday afternoon, Dana paid her usual visit to Victor. His pleading was as heartrending as ever. With a tender expression on her face, Dana pulled a small revolver from her purse. She fired a shot at Victor, killing him instantly. Dana immediately broke into tears and repeatedly kissed the face of her dead father. Hospital authorities called the police, and Dana was charged with Victor's death.\n\nWhat is the most serious offense of which Dana can be convicted?\n\n(A) First degree murder, defined by the jurisdiction as premeditated and deliberate killing of another human being.\n\n(B) Second degree murder, defined as any murder not classified as first degree murder.\n\n(C) Voluntary manslaughter.\n\n(D) No crime. \n\n\\section{Question 5}\n\nAndt lent his swim fins to his friend Gracehoper. Gracehoper promised to return the fins in a week, but two months had passed and, despite many reminders, Gracehoper still failed to return the fins. Andt decided to go to Gracehoper's cabin to retrieve them. Andt went to the cabin and knocked on the door, hoping to find Gracehoper at home. After knocking several times with no response, Andt tried the door and found it to be unlocked. Andt decided to look for the swim fins in Gracehoper's cabin and to retrieve them. Andt opened the door and entered Gracehoper's cabin. He looked around the cabin for $20 \\mathrm{~min}$ utes, but he could not locate the swim fins. He concluded that Gracehoper was probably using them and left the cabin, taking nothing from it and closing the door behind him.\n\nIf Andt is later charged and tried for burglary, Andt's best defense to the charge is which of the following?\n(A) Andt left the cabin without doing anything.\n(B) Andt took nothing from the cabin.\n(C) The swim fins belonged to Andt.\n(D) Gracehoper's door was unlocked.\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 6-7} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nKuegler, who had a long list of petty crimes to his credit, cased the Jaymart Department Store for a week. He noticed that a display case containing very expensive watches was near one of the store's exit doors. He planned to steal the watches by setting a diversionary fire in a trash basket, hoping that this would distract the store security personnel long enough for Kuegler to break the glass covering the watch case, grab the watches, and run out the nearby exit. Kuegler knew that the store had an automatic sprinkler system that would promptly douse the fire, but his purpose was merely to create a distraction rather than to cause any damage to the building. One afternoon at 2:30 p.m., Kuegler entered the Jaymart. He advanced to a trash barrel and poured some lighter fluid onto the trash. He threw the lighter fluid can into the barrel and tossed in a match after it. The lighter fluid immediately caused a long flame to rise. The flame quickly charred the wall next to the barrel and blistered the paint on the surrounding area. No serious damage was done to the structure, because the sprinklers operated as designed and quickly put out the fire before it could spread. Kuegler made a dash toward the case containing the watches, but just as he was breaking the glass case, one of the store's security guards apprehended Kuegler and called the police. Kuegler was read his Miranda rights and taken into police custody. A statute in the jurisdiction extends the crime of arson to buildings other than dwellings."

One afternoon Bulky was wandering rather aimlessly and became lost in an unfamiliar part of the city. He reached into his pocket and discovered he only had 35 cents. He wanted to take a bus back to the city center, but bus fare was $ 1$ per ride. Bulky was rather scruffily dressed and he had not had a haircut in several months. He approached Juan, a slightly built man who was standing alone at the bus stop. In a gruff voice, Bulky asked Juan, \"Do you have any money?\" When Juan replied, \"Yes,\"'Bulky said, \"Give me five dollars!\" Juan reached into his pocket and handed Bulky a five-dollar bill. Juan walked away from the bus and flagged down a passing patrol car. Juan told the police, \"I've been robbed,\" and pointed out Bulky, who was still standing at the bus stop. Bulky was arrested and charged with robbery.\n\nAt Bulky's trial, Bulky took the stand in his own defense. Bulky testified, \"I wasn't trying to rob anybody. I was just trying to beg some money to get myself back home.\"\n\nIf the jury believes Bulky's testimony, Bulky should be found:\n(A) Not guilty of robbery, because Bulky lacked the requisite criminal intent.\n(B) Guilty of robbery, because Bulky took Juan's money after intimidating him, and the effect of Bulky's size on Juan, rather than Bulky's intent, is controlling.\n(C) Not guilty of robbery, but guilty of assault, because Bulky placed Juan in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm.\n(D) Guilty of both robbery and assault, because assault is not a lesser included offense of robbery.\n\n\\section{Question 12}\n\nAlert police officers noticed that a late-model \"Belchfire 500\" automobile was being driven at an excessive rate of speed. The car, driven by Doofus, was pulled over to the curb. As Officer Smith issued a speeding citation to Doofus, her partner, Jones, fed the license plate numbers into the police computer. It turned out that the Belchfire had been very recently reported as stolen. Doofus was unable to produce satisfactory registration papers and was arrested for car theft. At the police station, Smith gave Doofus the standard Miranda warnings, and Doofus agreed to answer Smith's questions regarding a local \"chop-shop\" network, which arranged for the theft of expensive automobiles so that they could be cut up for parts. After a while, Jones suggested, \"Let's break for lunch.\" He and Smith escorted Doofus to a nearby cafeteria. During the course of their lunch, which lasted about an hour, Smith noticed that Doofus, who was otherwise rather shabbily dressed, was wearing an obviously expensive \"Xelor\" watch. Upon their return to the station, and without giving any new Miranda warnings, Smith resumed interrogation of Doofus. She asked Doofus about a recent home invasion in the swank \"Notting Hill\" neighborhood, where a quantity of valuable jewelry, including a \"Xelor\" watch, was taken. Doofus thereupon confessed to the home invasion, and was indicted on the home invasion charge, a felony under the jurisdiction's modern criminal code.\n\nIf Doofus files an appropriate motion to prevent the confession from being admitted at his trial, Doofus will probably:\n(A) Succeed, because the police did not repeat the Miranda warnings before questioning Doofus about another crime.\n(B) Succeed, because the police acted in a custodial setting.\n(C) Fail, because Doofus was not in custody on a home invasion charge.\n(D) Fail, because the original Miranda warn- ings given Doofus were sufficient under the circumstances. \n\n\\section{Question 13}\n\nDenise, a 12-year-old girl, entered a grocery store. When she believed that no one was looking, she grabbed two packages of \"Blinkies,\" a popular confectionery item, and concealed them under her coat. As she attempted to leave the store, Gordon, a security guard employed by the store, grabbed Denise by the arm. He told her, \"You're too young to be a thief!\"' Denise began crying and blurted out, \"I lost my lunch money on the way to school and I was really hungry!\"\n\nIf Denise is charged with shoplifting, what is the State's best argument that Denise's Miranda rights have not been violated by Gordon?\n\n(A) Gordon's statement was not interrogatory.\n\n(B) It is discretionary whether to give juveniles Miranda warnings.\n\n(C) Denise has not yet been arrested and formally charged with any crime.\n\n(D) Gordon was not a government agent.\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 14-15} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nSoar Airlines Flight 226 was a flight from Miami to Washington, D.C., with an hour stopover in Orlando.

The \"Huggums\" tires were manufactured by Kimbo Tire and Rubber Company, a reputable tire manufacturer. It was widely known in the tire industry that purchasers of tires would, on occasion, exceed posted speed limits, and therefore tires were designed to perform at speeds higher than the maximum speed of 65 m.p.h. allowable in most states. Sandra was a safe and careful driver who never exceeded the speed limit.\n\nWhen Sandra's car had 32,000 miles on it, she sold the car to Pedro. Pedro immediately took the car on a 500-mile trip to visit his sister. During the course of the journey, Pedro often drove his car 10 m.p.h. over the posted limit of 65 m.p.h. As Pedro approached his destination, he was driving 73 m.p.h. on smooth pavement. Suddenly his left front tire blew out for no apparent reason. The car went out of control, crashed into another vehicle, and Pedro was severely injured.\n\nIf Pedro sues Mac's for his injuries in a jurisdiction retaining traditional contributory negligence rules, Pedro should:\n\n(A) Recover, because the tire blew out for no apparent reason.\n\n(B) Recover, if the tire was defective when it left Kimbo's manufacturing plant.\n\n(C) Not recover, if Mac's had no reason to know or anticipate that there would be any defects in \"Huggums\" tires.\n\n(D) Not recover, because Pedro was contributorily negligent in exceeding the speed limit.\n\n\\section{Question 13}\n\nTen years ago Gasmask Chemicals, a leading chemical manufacturer, decided that it needed a safe place to store byproduct waste from its manufacturing processes. Many of these byproducts were highly toxic; thus, Gasmask took great care in selecting a dump site. A highly reputable engineering company was hired and an exhaustive survey was performed. Finally the Temblor Canyon site was selected and the chemicals were stored there underground, using state-of-the-art techniques. Although the survey and attendant geological soundings were performed with consummate skill, the surveyors failed to discover a crack in the rock of the storage area that was too small for their instruments to detect. Over a period of years the chemicals began to seep through the crack and into the water table below the surface. Scientists in nearby Canyon City discovered that the city's water supply, all of which came from local wells that tapped into the water table, contained unacceptably high levels of chemical contaminants. Canyon City was required to spend $ 5$ million on a complex filtration system to remove the dangerous chemicals from its water.\n\nCanyon City brought an action against Gasmask to recover the cost of building the filtration system. At the end of plaintiff's case establishing the above facts, Gasmask moved for a directed verdict.\n\nShould the court grant Gasmask's motion?\n\n(A) Yes, because Canyon City has not presented any evidence that Gasmask breached a duty owed to the city.\n\n(B) Yes, if the evidence also established that Canyon City's water wells were drilled after Gasmask stored the chemicals.\n\n(C) No, if the court determines as a matter of law that the chemicals could not be stored without risk of serious harm no matter how much care Gasmask took.\n\n(D) No, because the trier of fact could determine that the chemicals could not be stored without risk of serious harm no matter how much care Gasmask took. \n\n\\section{TORTS}\n\n\\section{Question 14}\n\nNeither the legislature nor the courts of State Yellow have abolished the common law tort defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. However, the State Yellow legislature decided it was time to take steps against all forms of drug abuse and passed the Omnibus Anti-Drug Act (\"OADA\"). One of the OADA provisions forbade the selling of airplane glue to anyone under the age of 18 except in small quantities in prepackaged model kits. Violation of the statute was penalized by fines or, in cases of multiple violations, possible imprisonment. OADA also required that all elementary and secondary schools licensed by the state provide comprehensive drug education programs.\n\nPrimrose was a 14-year-old resident of State Yellow. Primrose had experienced the drug education program in his school, as mandated by OADA. One of the units in the program covered the dangers of glue sniffing. Primrose understood the anti-drug instruction, but he enjoyed the \"high\" he got from sniffing glue when he constructed model airplanes, and he wanted to experience more of it. He went to Daffodil's Hobby \\& Craft Shop to purchase a large tube of airplane glue. Daffodil, sole proprietor of the hobby shop, sold the large tube of glue to Primrose. Primrose went home, hid in the garage, and sniffed the glue. His parents found Primrose in a coma on the garage floor. Although Primrose will survive, physicians have told his parents that he suffered permanent brain damage from sniffing the glue.\n\nOn Primrose's behalf, the parents filed suit against Daffodil, which should result in a verdict: (A) For Daffodil, because Primrose was aware of the danger when he sniffed the glue.\n\n(B) For Daffodil, because Primrose is not a member of the class of persons meant to be protected by OADA.\n\n(C) For Primrose, because Daffodil violated OADA when he sold the glue to Primrose.\n\n(D) For Primrose, unless Primrose could reasonably have been mistaken for an 18 year-old by Daffodil.\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 15-16} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nPluto, Donald, and Mickey were involved in a three-car accident.

After an article on the proposal in the Larchville Journal, the school board offices were swamped with calls and letters on the issue, most of them against the proposal. It was decided that the school board meeting scheduled for the next week would be held in the high school gymnasium and have an expanded public comment period. At the meeting, which was covered by a reporter from the Journal, Carla was one of numerous parents who spoke out against the proposal. One of the few speakers in favor of the proposal was Charlene, a director of a family planning group from a nearby large city, who described having to drop out of high school when she became pregnant as a teenager. When the Journal article on the school board meeting came out the next day, it identified Carla by her full name but described her as in favor of the proposal because she had to drop out of high school when she became pregnant. This statement was not true and caused great distress to Carla, whose religion considered premarital sex and artificial means of contraception sinful. If Carla brings a defamation action against the Larchville Journal, what will be the probable result?\n(A) The Journal will be liable because the statement in the article was false and defamatory.\n(B) The Journal will be liable if it was negli- gent as to the statement's truth or falsity.\n(C) The Journal will not be liable unless its reporter knew of the statement's falsity or acted with reckless disregard as to the statement's truth or falsity.\n(D) The Journal will not be liable because it was reporting on a public proceeding. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$$\n\\text { F. }\n$$\n\n\n\n\\section{CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ANSWERS}\n\n\\section{Answer to Question 1}\n\n(B) The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits state dilution of the right to vote by malapportionment of electoral districts. This rule applies to electoral districts for local governmental bodies as well as for the state legislature. When a local government establishes voting districts for the election of representatives, it must establish districts that do not have a significant variance in the number of persons in each district. Here, the Paulopolis districts have twice as many persons as the St. Minny districts, creating an unconstitutional dilution of the Paulopolis citizens' right to vote. (A) is incorrect. The clause in Article IV, Section 4 guaranteeing a \"republican form of government\" to the states has been judged by the Court to involve a political question. The Court will therefore decline to address that issue. (C) is incorrect because the Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause, which provides that citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states, only prohibits a state from discriminating in favor of its own citizens and against citizens of other states with regard to \"fundamental rights,\" i.e., those involving important commercial activities or civil liberties. Here, out-of-state citizens are not being discriminated against, so the clause is not applicable. (D) is incorrect because the Due Process Clause is usually used to review a law that limits the liberty of all persons to engage in some activity, whereas the Equal Protection Clause is implicated when a law limits the liberty or rights of some persons but not others. The option raising the equal protection argument is therefore the better choice.\n\n\\section{Answer to Question 2}\n\n(C) Dorit's strongest basis for challenging her denial of benefits by the federal government is the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Dorit's argument is that the regulations for determining who receives benefits create arbitrary and discriminatory classifications among similarly situated groups. Such classifications by a state government can be challenged under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but there is no counterpart to this clause applicable to the federal government. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has held that grossly unreasonable discrimination by the federal government violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and has applied the same standards that it uses in equal protection actions against a state. Hence, this clause constitutes Dorit's only plausible basis for a suit challenging the regulations. (A) is wrong because the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to states and not the federal government, and because it protects only certain privileges and immunities of national citizenship, none of which are implicated in this question. (B) is wrong because, as discussed above, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to the federal government. (D) is incorrect because a bill of attainder is a legislative act that inflicts punishment without a judicial trial on individuals who are designated either by name or in terms of past conduct. No aspect of the law here constitutes a bill of attainder.\n\n\\section{Answer to Question 3}\n\n(D) The federal statute will be upheld if Congress had a rational basis for making the classifications that it did. Governmental actions involving classifications of persons are examined under one of three standards, regardless of whether it is a federal government action scrutinized under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause or a state government action reviewed under the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. If a suspect classification or fundamental right is\n\n\\title{"

U-PumpIt's rules required drivers to park only in legally designated parking areas. After completing his deliveries for the day in Hooverville, Timmy stopped for a cup of coffee. He did not want to spend time trying to find a parking place on a side street, so he parked in front of Oswald's building, which was located on a through street. The area in front of Oswald's building was clearly marked, \"No Parking At Any Time.\" Timmy walked to the Emporium Restaurant, where he ordered coffee and the daily special.\n\nHooverville was located in an area subject to minor earthquake activity. Just as Timmy began his lunch, a quake jolted Hooverville. The quake was not strong enough to cause damage to structurally sound buildings, but was sufficient to cause the walls of Oswald's building to collapse. The building fell on top of the U-Pump-It truck, causing the truck to roll over on its side. Gasoline leaked from the truck and began streaming down the street. Elvira, a pedestrian walking two blocks away, lit a cigarette and casually tossed a match in the street. The stream of gasoline had just reached that street and the match caused the gasoline to ignite. The flames spread to a nearby commercial building.

Snoops, a reporter with The Daily Bleat, was assigned to write an obituary before the next day's edition went to press. Snoops talked briefly with Mary, Wally's widow, and then called State Medical School, from which Wally had always said he had graduated.

When asked about Wally, Nina replied, \"I don't think Wally ever graduated.\"\n\nIn Snoops's obituary, which appeared in the next morning's Daily Bleat, Snoops had written that Wally had never actually received a medical degree from State Medical School. Upon reading the obituary, Mary broke into tears and then became very angry, for she had worked hard to help put Wally through State Medical School, from which Wally had, in fact, graduated with high honors. Wally's executor, Eddie, was equally incensed. Both Eddie and Mary called The Daily Bleat, demanding a retraction.

They went to a local jeweler and looked at gold wedding bands, but saw nothing that appealed to them. When they discovered that the jeweler was himself a goldsmith and could make rings to order, they described what they were interested in and signed a purchase order for two rings; a woman's band for $ 500$ and a man's for $ 650$.\n\nThree weeks later, the jeweler called Shelley and informed her that the rings were ready. In the meantime, she and Herman had broken up and Herman had enlisted in the Marines and been sent to another state for training. The day after her 18th birthday, Shelley went to the jeweler and told him that they would not be needing the rings. When he protested that they were custom-made and would probably not sell to anyone else, Shelley said, \"All right, I've got $ 400$ in my savings account. I'll take my ring, but you'll have to find Herman about the other one.\" The jeweler had Shelley sign another purchase order for the woman's band at $ 400$, payment to be made by the end of the month.\n\nWhen the jeweler did not hear from Shelley after another month, he brought an action for breach of contract against her. Evidence produced at trial established that the market value of the rings was $ 500$ and $ 650$ for the woman's and man's, respectively, and that the age of majority in the jurisdiction was 18.\n\nIs the jeweler entitled to recover against Shelley?",

Muni-Power, an out-of-state supplier, brought suit against North Pacific challenging this statute.\n\nThe best constitutional argument Muni-Power could make is that the statute violates:\n\n(A) The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n(B) The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n(C) The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.\n\n(D) The Commerce Clause.\n\n\\section{Question 102}\n\nPaul sues Daniel for personal injuries that Paul suffered as a result of a battery committed on Paul by Daniel. Daniel's defense is that it is all a case of mistaken identity. Daniel admits that Paul was beaten up, but claims he had nothing to do with Paul's injuries. At trial, Daniel testified in his own behalf that on the date that Paul suffered his injuries, Daniel was on an extended vacation in England, 2,000 miles away from the place where the battery occurred. Paul's attorney did not cross-examine Daniel regarding that testimony. In rebuttal, Paul's attorney calls Walter, who is willing to testify that one week after Paul suffered his injuries, Daniel said to Walter, \"I haven't been out of the country in five years.\"\n\nWalter's testimony is:\n\n(A) Admissible as a statement against interest by Daniel.\n\n(B) Admissible as a prior inconsistent statement of Daniel.\n\n(C) Admissible as an admission by Daniel.\n\n(D) Inadmissible, because Daniel was not given an opportunity to comment on the statement prior to Walter's testimony.\n\n\\section{Question 103}\n\nIn which of the following circumstances would Defendant most likely be guilty of common law murder?\n\n(A) Defendant and Nate are having an argument, and Nate punches Defendant. Mistakenly believing that Nate intends to stab him, Defendant shoots him.\n\n(B) At a Fourth of July celebration, Defendant fires a pistol, and the ricocheting bullet hits and kills $\\mathrm{Al}$.\n\n(C) While hunting, Defendant sees a movement. Although he cannot see what moved, he believes it to be a deer and fires into the bush. In fact, the movement was caused by George, and George is killed by the bullet fired by Defendant.\n\n(D) During a robbery, Defendant accidentally drops a grenade. It goes off and a customer is killed. \n\n\\section{Questions 104-105} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nPitts purchased a new Stratton Spitfire sportscar manufactured by the Stratton Corporation from a local dealership. While Pitts was driving home from the dealership, she stopped at a red light. She was struck from behind by a truck driven by Drago, who had negligently failed to stop. On impact, the door on the driver's side of the car flew open because of a defective latch. Pitts fell out the open door and was injured. Pitts fell even though she was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the impact because the seatbelt buckle was also defective and failed to hold Pitts. Assume that a local ordinance requires all automobiles to be equipped with door latches that will not open on impact, and that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules."

Wyoming state law grants each county great autonomy in setting the health standards governing the preparation, packaging, transportation, and sale of foodstuffs. The Pecos County council recently enacted an ordinance, valid under the constitution and statutes of Wyoming, prohibiting the packaging and sale of any food item in any nonbiodegradable material; the ordinance defines nonbiodegradable and specifically lists as prohibited all forms of plastics, cellophane, or similar materials. The ordinance specifically exempts from its terms sales of food to public institutions such as hospitals, jails, and schools.\n\nSnak-Mart, a retail food seller in East Rabbit's Foot, files an appropriate court action attacking the Pecos County ordinance on the grounds that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

After extensive negotiations, it was orally agreed that TM would redesign the food production area of MacDougall's restaurants, including modification of cooking equipment, if necessary, so that, using existing MacDougall's food products, savings in labor costs through reduction in restaurant cooking staffs would result. Lawyers for MacDougall's subsequently drafted a written agreement, sent it to TM, whose lawyers modified the draft, and returned the modified draft to MacDougall's. This modified writing, signed by both parties, stated in its entirety:\n\nProvided that at least 2,000 work-hours per restaurant are eliminated, MacDougall Corporation will pay to TM within 90 days of installation of new food production systems at MacDougall's restaurants in Richmond a first installment of $1 million. Upon installation of new food processing systems nationwide, MacDougall Corporation will pay to TM a second and final installment of $ 1.5$ million. Nationwide installation must be completed by January 15,2005 . Any amendments to this agreement must be in writing signed by both parties.\n\nTM immediately began work on the restructuring of MacDougall's food processing methods. On September 5, 2004, a radical change in the layout of MacDougall's kitchen area and new personnel assignments had been designed, and TM demanded payment of the first installment payment of $ 1$ million.

Subsequent audits revealed that the new system enabled MacDougall Corporation to eliminate 1,500 work-hours per restaurant, saving the corporation $ 90,000$ in labor costs for all Richmond restaurants. The new system required that MacDougall's increase the length of the famous \"MacDougall Dog\" by three centimeters and that the \"Mother MacDougall Hot Apple Fritters\" be made in a rectangular shape rather than the traditional round form. Nationwide installation of the new system in all MacDougall's restaurants was completed on January 30, 2005. The 1,500 work-hours per restaurant savings to MacDougall Corporation was projected at $ 1.8$ million per year. TM sent a certified letter to the chief executive officer of MacDougall Corporation requesting his certification that the new food production system was in place and operating as promised, and demanding the $ 1.5 \\mathrm{mil}$ lion second installment. The CEO refused to so certify and refused to make any payment, noting in his reply letter that the system had not been installed by January 15,2005 , and that it did not use existing MacDougall's food products, as promised by TM.\n\n\n\n Was TM entitled to payment of the first installment when it completed design work on the new system on September 5, 2004?",

This modified writing, signed by both parties, stated in its entirety:\n\nProvided that at least 2,000 work-hours per restaurant are eliminated, MacDougall Corporation will pay to TM within 90 days of installation of new food production systems at MacDougall's restaurants in Richmond a first installment of $1 million. Upon installation of new food processing systems nationwide, MacDougall Corporation will pay to TM a second and final installment of $ 1.5$ million. Nationwide installation must be completed by January 15,2005 . Any amendments to this agreement must be in writing signed by both parties.\n\nTM immediately began work on the restructuring of MacDougall's food processing methods. On September 5, 2004, a radical change in the layout of MacDougall's kitchen area and new personnel assignments had been designed, and TM demanded payment of the first installment payment of $ 1$ million. MacDougall Corporation refused, but negotiations conducted between the parties resulted in an oral agreement that MacDougall's would pay $ 750,000$ immediately and then the $ 1.5$ million second \n\n\\section{MIXED SUBJECTS}\n\ninstallment as originally agreed, after nationwide installation of the new system.\n\nThe restructured food production system was installed and in operation in all Richmond MacDougall's restaurants on October 1, 2004. Subsequent audits revealed that the new system enabled MacDougall Corporation to eliminate 1,500 work-hours per restaurant, saving the corporation $ 90,000$ in labor costs for all Richmond restaurants. The new system required that MacDougall's increase the length of the famous \"MacDougall Dog\" by three centimeters and that the \"Mother MacDougall Hot Apple Fritters\" be made in a rectangular shape rather than the traditional round form. Nationwide installation of the new system in all MacDougall's restaurants was completed on January 30, 2005. The 1,500 work-hours per restaurant savings to MacDougall Corporation was projected at $ 1.8$ million per year. TM sent a certified letter to the chief executive officer of MacDougall Corporation requesting his certification that the new food production system was in place and operating as promised, and demanding the $ 1.5 \\mathrm{mil}$ lion second installment. The CEO refused to so certify and refused to make any payment, noting in his reply letter that the system had not been installed by January 15,2005 , and that it did not use existing MacDougall's food products, as promised by TM.\n\n\n\nAssume for the purposes of this question only that TM brings an action for breach of contract against MacDougall Corporation seeking as damages $ 1.5$ million. MacDougall's attempts to introduce the testimony of its chief negotiator describing the oral agreement with TM representatives that the new food processing system would use existing MacDougall's food products. TM objects, arguing that the parol evidence rule bars admission of this testimony. Which of the following is the best argument supporting admission of the testimony?",

Other persons and organizations conducted various American history tours through the city for somewhat less than Peterson, but Peterson's tour was generally rated the best by the leading tourist guidebooks because Peterson personally conducted the tours and shared his encyclopedic knowledge of American history and the city of Philadelphia.\n\nDavid had recently moved to Philadelphia, and all of his co-workers praised Professor Peterson's tour, but David was not inclined to pay $ 105$ for a tour of the historical sites of his new city. Therefore, David took a day off one Thursday and \"hung around\" the Liberty Bell monument, where Peterson's tour started. That day Peterson was conducting 27 persons on the tour. Most of the participants had paid in advance, but Peterson was holding up a sign with information about the tour and handing out brochures, one of which David took. Peterson accepted a few additional participants who signed up on the spot, but David was not among them. All day long, David hung around at the fringe of this group, paying the entrance fees separately but following the group through the different historical sites. However, he always positioned himself close enough to Peterson's group so that he could hear virtually every word of Peterson's lecture, although David did not ask Peterson any questions. David signed his name and address on the register at Independence Hall. Peterson noted this and took down the information.

At that time Silo was using bagged cement, which caused little or no dust. In 1970, Petrone bought a home approximately 1,800 feet from the Silo plant. One year ago, Silo stopped using bagged cement and began to receive cement in bulk shipments. Since then at least five truckloads of cement have passed Petrone's house daily. Cement blows off the trucks and into Petrone's house. When the cement arrives at the Silo plant, it is blown by forced air from the trucks into the storage bin. As a consequence, cement dust fills the air surrounding the plant to a distance of 2,000 feet. Petrone's house is the only residence within 2,000 feet of the plant.\n\nIf Petrone asserts a claim against Silo based on nuisance, will Petrone prevail?",

Both civil and criminal penalties are established for violation of the Act, and it permits private civil suits for injunctive relief or for damages to enforce its provisions.\n\nThe city of Davis, California also enacted a jobs opportunity ordinance effective the same year, requiring that any employer doing business with the city have a workforce consonant with the ethnic and gender composition of the population of the city. The local ordinance permits employers to apply for exemptions from its requirements if they can demonstrate that the pool of potential qualified employees has a different mix of ethnicity or gender than the general population. The population of Davis is approximately $55 \\%$ female and $45 \\%$ male, $75 \\%$ white, $10 \\%$ Asian, 7\\% black, 7\\% Hispanic, and $1 \\%$ other ethnic backgrounds.\n\nWatson Janitorial Service, a private employer located in the city of Davis, does contract cleaning and maintenance for both the local United States Department of Agriculture office and for the City Jail. Its workforce is $95 \\%$ male, $55 \\%$ black, $40 \\%$ Hispanic, and $5 \\%$ other ethnic backgrounds. The city of Davis notified the company that it would either have to bring its workforce into compliance with the local job opportunity ordinance or its contract with the City Jail would be terminated. The United States Department of Justice has notified Watson Janitorial that it meets the guidelines of the Fair Opportunity Act, and that the contract with the Department of Agriculture is not in jeopardy. 6. Watson Janitorial brings an action in state court to enjoin enforcement of the Davis ordinance. It argues that the local rule is invalid since it conflicts with the federal statute by creating more stringent standards. The trial court should rule:\n\n(A) There is no conflict, since Congress intended only that the Fair Opportunity Act apply to employers who dealt exclusively with the federal government.\n\n(B) There is no conflict, since Davis is permitted to impose more strict requirements to a local problem than those established by the federal government.\n\n(C) The federal act preempts the local ordinance and thus the latter cannot be enforced.\n\n(D) The federal act preempts the local ordinance only insofar as it attempts to regulate employers who do business with the federal government, so the ordinance may not be enforced only as to Watson Janitorial, but is otherwise valid.\n\n\n\n Assume for the purposes of this question only that the United States Department of Agriculture notifies Watson Janitorial that its workforce is in violation of the Fair Opportunity Act and that a referral will be made to the Department of Justice for prosecution unless the federal standards are met within six months. If Watson challenges the validity of the federal statute in court, what is the government's best response to the argument that Congress has exceeded its legitimate powers? I. The act is a valid enforcement of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nII. The act is a valid exercise of the commerce power.\n\nIII.

Defendant is charged with attempting to receive stolen property. \n\n\\section{Question 10}\n\nThe city of Newtown adopted an ordinance providing that street demonstrations involving more than 15 persons may not be held in commercial areas during \"rush\" hours. \"Exceptions\" may be made to the prohibition \"upon 24-hour advance application to and approval by the police department.\" The ordinance also imposes sanctions on any person \"who shall, without provocation, use to or of another, and in his presence, opprobrious words or abusive language tending to cause a breach of the peace.\" No court has of yet interpreted the ordinance.\n\nWhich of the following is the strongest argument for the unconstitutionality of both parts of the ordinance on their faces?\n\n(A) No type of prior restraint may be imposed on speech in public places.\n\n(B) Laws, regulating by their terms expressive conduct or speech, may not be overbroad or unduly vague.\n\n(C) The determination as to whether public gatherings may be lawfully held cannot be vested in the police.\n\n(D) The right of association in public places without interference is ensured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n\\section{Question 11}\n\nTruffle agreed in writing to lease a restaurant site in a newly constructed mall from Lentil, the owner of the property. The term of the tenancy was two years, and rent was payable in monthly installments at the beginning of each month. At the end of the second year, there had been no discussions between Truffle and Lentil regarding renewal or termination. Truffle did not vacate the premises at the end of the term; instead, she sent a check for the next month's rent to Lentil. Lentil cashed the check after the term had expired but informed Truffle that his acceptance of the check did not mean that he was going to renew the lease or let Truffle stay. At the end of that month, Lentil seeks advice on whether he can evict Truffle.\n\nHow should Lentil be advised to proceed?\n\n(A) Lentil must give Truffle a full 30 days' notice before beginning eviction proceedings because a month-to-month periodic tenancy has been created.\n\n(B) Lentil may begin eviction proceedings as soon as the additional month has expired.\n\n(C) Lentil may not evict Truffle for 11 months and must give six months' notice before beginning eviction proceedings because a year-to-year periodic tenancy has been created.\n\n(D) Lentil may not evict Truffle for 11 months but need not give any notice prior to eviction because a tenancy for years for a term of one year has been created. \n\n\\section{Question 12}\n\nDirk broke into Vera's house one night. As he started to stuff silverware into a sack, he was surprised by Vera, who had arrived home earlier than usual. Dirk struck Vera on the head with a candlestick and tied her up. He finished filling his sack and left.\n\nThe police discovered Vera several hours later and rushed her to the hospital. Dirk was apprehended by the police early the following morning with the loot still in his possession. He was taken to police headquarters, given Miranda warnings, and asked if he wished to make a statement about the prior evening's events. The police did not mention that Vera had been seriously injured and was in the hospital. Dirk said he understood his rights and was willing to talk. He then admitted that he committed the burglary of Vera's house. The following day, Vera died from injuries caused by the blow to her head.\n\nIf, at Dirk's trial for murder, Dirk moves to prevent introduction of the confession into evidence, his motion should most probably be:\n\n(A) Denied, because failure of the police to advise Dirk of Vera's condition was harmless error since felony murder does not require intent to kill or injure.\n\n(B) Denied, because Dirk's waiver of his rights did not depend upon the nature of the charges that were later filed against him.\n\n(C) Granted, because Dirk could not make a knowing and intelligent waiver unless he had information concerning Vera's condition.\n\n(D) Granted, because the use of a confession to burglary in a prosecution for murder violates due process where the police withheld information about the potential seriousness of the offense.\n\n\\section{Question 13}\n\nWest, a witness in a contract case, testified on direct examination that four people attended a meeting. When asked to identify them, she gave the names of three, but despite trying was unable to remember the name of the fourth person.\n\nThe attorney who called her as a witness seeks to show her his handwritten notes of the part of his pretrial interview with her in which she provided all four names.\n\nThe trial court is likely to consider the showing of the notes taken as:\n(A) A proper attempt to introduce recorded recollection.\n(B) A proper attempt to refresh West's recollec- tion.\n(C) An improper attempt to lead the witness.\n(D) An improper attempt to support West's credibility. \n\n\\section{Question 14}\n\nBuyer, a retail seller of lawn and garden equipment, entered into a written contract with Seller, a manufacturer of wheelbarrows. The terms of the contract call for Seller to deliver 100 fifteen-pound capacity, red wheelbarrows to Buyer by March 1. On February 28, Buyer received from Seller 90 fifteen-pound capacity, red wheelbarrows and 10 twenty-pound capacity, red wheelbarrows. A letter accompanying the shipment stated, \"We no longer make fifteen-pound capacity wheelbarrows. We are sending the last 90 we have in stock along with 10 twenty-pound capacity wheelbarrows. The twenty-pound capacity were sent as an accommodation to you.\" Which of the following correctly states the rights of Buyer?\n\nI. Buyer can reject the entire shipment.\n\nII. Buyer can accept the 90 conforming wheelbarrows, reject the 10 nonconforming wheelbarrows, and sue Seller for damages.\n\nIII. Buyer can accept the entire shipment and sue Seller for damages.\n\n(A) Only I. and II. are correct.\n\n(B) Only I. is correct.\n\n(C) I., II., and III. are correct.\n\n(D) Only II. is correct.\n\n\\section{Question 15}\n\nThe German-made Doppelpferd, featuring sleek styling and remarkable fuel efficiency, is the most popular automobile in the United States. Its United States sales are booming, and the average retail markup in such sales is $30 \\%$. Hardsell Motors, Inc., a franchised Doppelpferd dealer in the United States, contracted with Shift to sell him a new Doppelpferd for $ 9,000$ cash, the sale to be consummated after delivery to Hardsell of the car, which Hardsell ordered from the manufacturer specifically for Shift. The signed retail contractual document was a form drafted by Hardsell's lawyer, and Shift did not question or object to any of its terms, including the price inserted by Hardsell. When the car arrived from Germany, Shift repudiated the contract. Hardsell at once sold the car for $ 9,000$ cash to Karbuff, for whom Hardsell had also ordered from the manufacturer a Doppelpferd identical to Shift's.\n\nIn an action against Shift for breach of contract, Hardsell will probably recover:\n(A) $ 9,000$ minus what it cost Hardsell to purchase the car from the manufacturer.\n(B) $ 9,000$ minus the wholesale price of an identical Doppelpferd in the local whole- sale market among dealers.\n(C) Nominal damages only because Hardsell resold the car to Karbuff without lowering the retail price.\n(D) Nothing, because the parties' agreement was an adhesion contract and therefore unconscionable. \n\n\\section{Question 16}\n\nPike sued Digger, the contractor who constructed Pike's house, for breach of warranty of habitability. At trial, in cross-examination of Pike, Digger's attorney asked whether Pike had sued another contractor 30 years earlier, claiming similar defects in another house built for Pike. The question was not objected to and Pike answered that she had had some \"water problems\" with the first house she ever purchased, but no suit was filed.\n\nDigger then called Wirth, the contractor of 30 years earlier, to testify that Pike had brought suit against Wirth for defects in the earlier house, many of which were like those now claimed to be found in the home Digger built, but that the case was settled without trial.\n\nThe trial court should rule Wirth's offered testimony:\n\n(A) Admissible as proper impeachment since Pike will have an opportunity to deny or explain Wirth's statement.\n\n(B) Admissible, because Pike failed to object to Digger's questions on cross-examination relative to the prior suit.\n\n(C) Inadmissible, because the best evidence of the former suit is the court record.\n\n(D) Inadmissible, because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that it will confuse the issues and waste time.\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 17-18} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nHammond decided to kill his wife by poisoning her. He asked his friend, Jordan, a pharmacist, to obtain some curare, a deadly poison, and to give it to him without recording the transaction. Because Jordan suspected Hammond's motive, she supplied Hammond with a small quantity of Marvane, an antibiotic, instead of curare. Marvane is harmless if administered in small quantities, except for the less than $1 \\%$ of the population who are allergic to the drug. Hammond injected his wife with the Marvane while she slept. She was allergic to the drug and died from the injection. Jordan was distraught and confessed the entire affair to the police, explaining that she had failed to report Hammond's conduct to the authorities because she feared that it would end their friendship if she did."

            "Problem Statement": "In the recently enacted Fair Opportunity Act, the United States Congress provided, among other things, that an employer whose products are in any way used by or sold to the federal government must meet certain very specific standards for integration of its workforce and affirmative action programs. Both civil and criminal penalties are established for violation of the Act, and it permits private civil suits for injunctive relief or for damages to enforce its provisions.\n\nThe city of Davis, California also enacted a jobs opportunity ordinance effective the same year, requiring that any employer doing business with the city have a workforce consonant with the ethnic and gender composition of the population of the city. The local ordinance permits employers to apply for exemptions from its requirements if they can demonstrate that the pool of potential qualified employees has a different mix of ethnicity or gender than the general population. The population of Davis is approximately $55 \\%$ female and $45 \\%$ male, $75 \\%$ white, $10 \\%$ Asian, 7\\% black, 7\\% Hispanic, and $1 \\%$ other ethnic backgrounds.\n\nWatson Janitorial Service, a private employer located in the city of Davis, does contract cleaning and maintenance for both the local United States Department of Agriculture office and for the City Jail. Its workforce is $95 \\%$ male, $55 \\%$ black, $40 \\%$ Hispanic, and $5 \\%$ other ethnic backgrounds. The city of Davis notified the company that it would either have to bring its workforce into compliance with the local job opportunity ordinance or its contract with the City Jail would be terminated. The United States Department of Justice has notified Watson Janitorial that it meets the guidelines of the Fair Opportunity Act, and that the contract with the Department of Agriculture is not in jeopardy. 6. Watson Janitorial brings an action in state court to enjoin enforcement of the Davis ordinance. It argues that the local rule is invalid since it conflicts with the federal statute by creating more stringent standards. The trial court should rule:\n\n(A) There is no conflict, since Congress intended only that the Fair Opportunity Act apply to employers who dealt exclusively with the federal government.\n\n(B) There is no conflict, since Davis is permitted to impose more strict requirements to a local problem than those established by the federal government.\n\n(C) The federal act preempts the local ordinance and thus the latter cannot be enforced.\n\n(D) The federal act preempts the local ordinance only insofar as it attempts to regulate employers who do business with the federal government, so the ordinance may not be enforced only as to Watson Janitorial, but is otherwise valid.\n\n\n\nJordan is an accomplice to:",

            "Problem Statement": "Lightpost, Inc., the owner of a retail outlet mall, leased one of its retail units to Shirts by Sam (\"Shirts\"), a chain selling casual apparel, for a period of five years. The lease agreement provided that Shirts would pay to Lightpost, as additional rent, a share of maintenance costs for the construction and upkeep of the parking lots and other common areas in the mall, and Lightpost would be responsible for maintaining these areas. The maintenance fee was calculated based on total square footage of each unit and amounted to $ 1,000$ a month for the unit leased by Shirts. The agreement also permitted assignments and subleases. For four years, Shirts operated its apparel store and paid all rent and maintenance fees. At the end of the fourth year, Shirts properly assigned the lease to Shoes by Sheila (\"Shoes\"), a discount shoe outlet.\n\n\n\n Assume for purposes of this question only that, at the time it assigned the lease, Shirts owed $3,000 in maintenance fees for the last three months of its occupancy, and that Shoes paid its rent but did not pay any maintenance fees to Lightpost for the first six months. Shoes then abandoned the property. Lightpost made reasonable efforts during the last six months of the term to relet the unit but was unable to do so. After applying the security deposit to satisfy the balance of the rent, Lightpost wishes to collect the unpaid maintenance fees during the last 15 months of the lease, totaling $ 15,000$. Who is liable for those fees and in what amount?",

Assume for purposes of this question only that, shortly after Shirts assigned the lease to Shoes, Lightpost sold the mall to Lakeview, Ltd. Lakeview took subject to all of the leases, including Shoes's lease, but did not assume any of Lightpost's obligations under it. Five months after the sale, a contractor originally hired by Lightpost who was reconstructing the parking lot in front of Shoes's store walked off the job because he had not received any progress payments from either Lightpost or Lakeview during the past five months. After notifying Lightpost and Lakeview and receiving no response, Shoes agreed to pay the contractor $ 20,000$ up front to finish the job so that the store would have parking for the holiday shopping season. Shoes then withheld its rent payment of $ 2,000$ for that month and brought an action against Lightpost and Lakeview to recover the balance of the payment to the contractor. Shoes had paid its maintenance fees in advance for the rest of its term.\n\nAre either Lightpost or Lakeview liable to Shoes?\n\n(A) Neither Lakeview nor Lightpost is liable to Shoes because Shoes is in breach of its covenant to pay rent.\n\n(B) Lightpost is liable to Shoes, but Lakeview is not, because Lakeview did not assume Lightpost's obligations.\n\n(C) Lakeview is liable to Shoes, but Lightpost is not, because the sale by Lightpost to Lakeview severed any privity of estate between Lightpost and Shoes.\n\n(D) Both Lakeview and Lightpost are liable to Shoes because the maintenance duties constitute an independent covenant that is part of the lease and that runs with land.\n\n\\section{Question 22}\n\nTo secure an express lane on the information superhighway, the federal government contracted with a number of communications utilities to install fiberoptic communication lines between major federal offices across the country. The utilities, which maintained ownership of the lines, contracted with the federal government to install the lines on a \"cost plus fixed fee\" basis, whereby all installation costs would be reimbursed by the government. One such line was installed in State Yellow's capital city, Plains, where the Department of the Interior maintained its western regional office. State Yellow imposes a tax on the installation of all communication lines in the state, including fiberoptic cable lines. It seeks to impose the tax on the line running to the federal office.\n\nWill the state be permitted to impose the tax?\n(A) Yes, because the tax is indirect and nondis- criminatory.\n(B) Yes, because the tax is a valid exercise of state power under the Tenth Amendment.\n(C) No, because the tax burdens the activities of the federal government.\n(D) No, because the activity taxed involves interstate commerce. \n\n\\section{Question 23}\n\nIn an action by Patrick against David, one of the issues is whether David is a licensed psychotherapist. Normally, the names of all licensed psychotherapists are registered with the office of the State Department of Professional Registrations. Patrick wishes to introduce a certified document, signed by the chief registrar of the Department, stating that an examination of the Department's rolls does not disclose David's name.\n\nShould the document be admitted?\n(A) Yes, because a statement of absence from public record is admissible.\n(B) Yes, but only if the chief registrar is un- available.\n(C) No, because the document is hearsay not within an exception.\n(D) No, because the document is not self- authenticating.\n\n\\section{Question 24}\n\nWhile on a hiking trip during the late fall, Page arrived toward the end of the day at a clearing where several similar cabins were located, none of which was occupied. One of the cabins belonged to Levin, Page's friend, who had given Page permission to use it. Page entered one of the cabins, which she thought was Levin's, and prepared to spend the night. In fact the cabin was owned, not by Levin, but by Dwyer.\n\nWhen the night turned cold, Page started a fire in the stove. Unknown to Page, there was a defect in the stove that allowed carbon monoxide fumes to escape into the cabin. During the night the fumes caused serious injury to Page.\n\nIf Page asserts a claim against Dwyer for her injury, will Page recover?\n(A) Yes, if Dwyer knew that the stove was defective.\n(B) Yes, if Dwyer could have discovered the defect in the stove by a reasonable inspec- tion.\n(C) No, because Dwyer had no reason to anticipate Page's presence in the cabin.\n(D) No, unless Page needed to use the cabin for her own protection. \n\n\\section{Question 25}\n\nOn a wholly random basis, a state agency has given a few probationary employees who were not rehired at the end of their probationary period a statement of reasons and an opportunity for a hearing; but the agency has very rarely done so. No statute or rule of the agency required such a statement of reasons or a hearing.\n\nThe employment of Masters, a probationary employee, was terminated without a statement of reasons or an opportunity for a hearing. The agency did not even consider whether it should give him either.\n\nA suit by Masters requesting a statement of reasons and a hearing will probably be:\n\n(A) Successful, on the grounds that failure to give Masters reasons and an opportunity for a hearing constituted a bill of attainder.\n\n(B) Successful, on the grounds that an agency's inconsistent practices, even if unintentional, deny adversely affected persons the equal protection of the laws.\n\n(C) Unsuccessful, because Masters does not have a right to be rehired that is protected by procedural due process.\n\n(D) Unsuccessful, because the conditions of state employment are matters reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\n\n\\section{Question 26}\n\nMarvin Manufacturing Company was in the business of making copper tubing. Golde Industries telephoned Marvin's sales department and placed an order for 10,000 linear feet of copper tubing at a sale price of $ 2$ per foot. The tubing was to be used in the production of a custom order for one of Golde's customers. Marvin installed special equipment for the manufacture of the tubing to Golde's specifications and had completed a portion of the order when Golde again telephoned the sales department. This time, however, Golde canceled its order, saying it no longer had need of the tubing because its customer had been declared bankrupt, and refused to pay for the order.\n\nIf Marvin sues for breach, it will:\n\n(A) Win, because the contract is fully enforceable.\n\n(B) Win, because the contract is enforceable to the extent of the portion of the order completed.\n\n(C) Lose, because a contract for the sale of goods over $ 500$ must be in writing.\n\n(D) Lose, because the parol evidence rule would preclude testimony about the initial telephone call.\n\n\\section{Question 27}\n\nPolice investigating a homicide had probable cause to believe that Drake had committed it. They then learned from a reliable informant that, a short while ago, Drake had gone to Trent's house to obtain a false driver's license from Trent, a convicted forger. Believing that Drake might still be there, the police, without obtaining a warrant, went to Trent's house. They entered the house and found Drake hiding in the basement. He was arrested and given his Miranda warnings. At the police station, he confessed to the homicide.\n\nAt a preliminary hearing, Drake's attorney contends that the confession should be suppressed on Fourth Amendment grounds.\n\nIs the court likely to agree?\n\n(A) Yes, because the police did not have a search warrant to enter Trent's house and there were no exigent circumstances.\n\n(B) Yes, because the police did not have an arrest warrant for Drake and there were no exigent circumstances.\n\n(C) No, because a reliable informant told police that Drake was in Trent's house.\n\n(D) No, because the police had probable cause to arrest Drake. \n\n\\section{Question 28}\n\nAll of the deeds for the lots in the 5100 block of Elm Street contained a restrictive covenant requiring that all houses built on the lots be set back a minimum of 50 feet from the sidewalk. Local zoning regulations required that all homes in the area of the 5100 block of Elm Street be set back a minimum of 35 feet from the sidewalk. Dampier purchased a lot on the 5100 block of Elm Street on which it would be possible to build a home with a 50-foot setback. However, the lot was of an unusual shape, and Dampier applied to the city zoning commission asking for a variance allowing him to build a house set back 30 feet from the sidewalk. In his petition, Dampier cited the unusual shape of the lot and asserted that it would cause hardship for him to build in compliance with the 35-foot setback required by the zoning regulations. The zoning commission granted Dampier the variance. Nora, whose home was located at 5130 Elm Street, noticed surveyors putting up ropes 30 feet from the sidewalk on Dampier's lot, and she discovered that Dampier planned to build a home with only a 30 -foot setback.\n\nNora seeks to enforce the restrictive covenant and brings suit to enjoin Dampier from building a residence with a setback of less than 50 feet. Who will prevail?\n\n(A) Dampier, because zoning regulations take precedence over restrictive covenants as a matter of public policy.\n\n(B) Dampier, because equity will not impose a hardship.\n\n(C) Nora, because Dampier will be unjustly enriched if he is permitted to build a 30 foot setback.\n\n(D) Nora, because a zoning variance does not affect the enforcement of a restrictive covenant.\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 29-30} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nOn January 1, Awl and Howser agreed in writing that Awl would build a house on Howser's lot according to Howser's plans and specifications for $ 60,000$, the work to commence on April 1. Howser agreed to make an initial payment of $ 10,000$ on April 1, and to pay the balance upon completion of the work.\n\nOn February 1, Awl notified Howser that he (Awl) would lose money on the job at that price, and would not proceed with the work unless Howser would agree to increase the price to $ 90,000$. Howser thereupon, without notifying Awl, agreed in writing with Gutter for Gutter, commencing April 1, to build the house for $ 75,000$, which was the fair market cost of the work to be done.\n\nOn April 1, both Awl and Gutter showed up at the building site to begin work, Awl telling Howser that he had decided to \"take the loss\" and would build the house for $ 60,000$ as originally agreed.

Smith, the owner of Whiteacre, was not yet sure he wished to sell the property. He was waiting to see if his bid on another parcel was going to be accepted. Before Smith could make up his mind, Benjamin was assigned to cover an ethnic conflict in eastern Europe that was escalating into a war. Prior to his departure, Benjamin gave his attorney, Lenora, $ 100,000$ and his power of attorney. He instructed Lenora that, should Whiteacre be put up for sale, she was authorized to: offer up to $ 100,000$ for it, enter into a binding contract to purchase it on Benjamin's behalf, and if he did not return in time, she was authorized to close on the property. In early January, Smith put Whiteacre on the market. Lenora offered $ 75,000$ for it, which Smith readily accepted. On January 15, Lenora, on Benjamin's behalf, entered into a written contract to purchase Whiteacre for $ 75,000$. Closing was set for February 15 . During this time, Lenora heard nothing from Benjamin. When he had not returned by the date of closing, Lenora attended the closing and tendered the $ 75,000$. Smith tendered a deed made out to Benjamin as the grantee.\n\nOn February 20, news was received that Benjamin had been killed by a stray bullet on January 14. Benjamin's will left his entire estate to his niece, Nellie. In the meantime, Smith has had someone offer him $ 150,000$ for Whiteacre. Having heard of Benjamin's death, Smith believes the conveyance to Benjamin is invalid. Smith brings a suit to quiet title to Whiteacre.\n\nThe court will most likely find that the owner of Whiteacre is:\n(A) Nellie, because Lenora held the deed on constructive trust for Benjamin's estate.\n(B) Nellie, because of the operation of the doctrine of equitable conversion.\n(C) Smith, because a deed to a nonexistent person is void and conveys no title.\n(D) Smith, because the risk of loss is on the buyer. \n\n\\section{Question 32}\n\nPatricia sued Doris for injuries suffered when her car collided in an intersection with one driven by Doris. At trial, Patricia testified that she had had the right-of-way over Doris to enter the intersection. Doris did not cross-examine. Patricia then called Wendy to testify that, shortly after the collision, as she pulled Patricia from the car, Wendy heard Patricia say, \"I think I'm dying! Didn't the other driver see I had the right-of-way?\" Wendy's testimony was admitted over defense counsel's objections. On appeal from a verdict for Patricia, Doris challenges the admission of Wendy's testimony.\n\nShould the trial court's ruling be upheld?\n(A) Yes, because Patricia's statement was made under belief of impending death.\n(B) Yes, because Patricia's statement was an excited utterance.\n(C) No, because Patricia's credibility had not been attacked.\n(D) No, because Patricia's belief that she had the right-of-way had already been estab- lished without contradiction.\n\n\\section{Question 33}\n\nThere is high and persistent unemployment in the industrialized state of Green.

Bert, who had lived in Metropolis all of his 67 years, was out windowshopping with his wife, Ruth, also 67 , when he saw a friend across the street at a diner they both frequented. Telling Ruth that he would be right back, he saw that there were no cars nearby and so strode briskly across the street in the middle of the block. As he reached the other sidewalk, a police officer who had been checking parked cars for parking violations stepped up to Bert and said, \"Hold it buddy, let's see your driver's license,\" and then reached for her citation book. Bert, a city dweller from birth, had always walked or used public transportation, had never learned to drive, and did not have a driver's license.

She executed two instruments in the proper form of deeds. The first instrument purported to convey an undivided one-half interest in Greenacre to Henry and his wife, Audrey, as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The second instrument purported to convey an undivided one-half interest in Greenacre to Susan, the only child of Henry. Susan was 13 years old at the time. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. No actual consideration was paid for the deeds. Constance handed the two deeds to Henry. Henry promptly and properly recorded the deed to himself and Audrey and put the deed to his daughter, Susan, in a safe-deposit box without recording it.\n\nThe same year, Henry, Audrey, and Susan were on a vacation when the plane in which they were flying went down, and all three were killed simultaneously.

Constance, who is not an heir of any of the deceased, was a party to the action.\n\nThe court should determine that title to Greenacre is:\n(A) Entirely in Constance.\n(B) One-half in the heirs of Henry and one-half in the heirs of Audrey.\n(C) One-half in Constance, one-quarter in the heirs of Henry, and one-quarter in the heirs of Audrey.\n(D) One-half in the heirs of Susan, one-quarter in the heirs of Henry, and one-quarter in the heirs of Audrey. \n\n\\section{Question 42}\n\nArgus Corporation is privately owned and incorporated in the state of Kiowa.

Clinton's subpoena provided that any information concerning the matters handled for other clients be deleted or masked. Able moved to quash the subpoena on the ground of attorney-client privilege. The subpoena should be:\n\n(A) Upheld, because the information about hours billed is not within the privilege.\n\n(B) Upheld, because an attorney has no right to invoke his client's privilege without instructions from the client.\n\n(C) Quashed, because an attorney is entitled to a right of privacy for the work product in his files.\n\n(D) Quashed, because no permission was obtained from the other clients to divulge information from their files.\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 44-45} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nTorgeson, a prosperous widower, owned Fruitacre, a large tract of land located near Sunbelt City.

            "Problem Statement": "Torgeson, a prosperous widower, owned Fruitacre, a large tract of land located near Sunbelt City. Fruitacre was primarily used for extensive citrus orchards, but Torgeson was sure that rapidly growing Sunbelt City would expand toward Fruitacre, and that Fruitacre would be a prime tract for a residential subdivision within 20 years. Torgeson wanted to see his three grandchildren, Hubert (age 22), Dubert (age 17), and Luberta (age 15), benefit from the large price that he was sure Fruitacre would bring, but he was also concerned that the grandchildren be of sufficient maturity. Torgeson suggested to his only child, Diana, that he give her a life interest in Fruitacre, and that Diana's children take Fruitacre upon her death. Diana told Torgeson that she did not need the income from Fruitacre and would prefer that Torgeson give the land directly to Hubert, Dubert, and Luberta. Torgeson arrived at what he felt was a reasonable compromise, using his good friend, Fran (age 55), as the person to whom he conveyed the land. Torgeson's conveyance read, in pertinent part, as follows: \"I convey Fruitacre to Fran for life, remainder to all of my grandchildren who ever attain the age of 25 , and if none of them attains such age, to the Sisters of Charity.\" 44. The grandchildren's interest can best be described as:\n(A) A contingent remainder.\n(B) A vested remainder.\n(C) An executory interest.\n(D) Nothing.\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is the strongest argument in favor of the constitutionality of free distribution of textbooks to the students at Stone School?",

Edgewater had contracts with a number of large office and condominium buildings to provide emergency electrical services and repairs at any hour of the day or night. Edgewater also advertised in the telephone \"yellow pages\": \"If it's an electrical emergency, call Edgewater Electric Servicesnight or day.\"' Although Edgar usually worked from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Edgewater, the nature of Edgewater's emergency services required Edgar to be \"on call\" 24 hours a day. Therefore, Edgewater required Edgar to drive his company van to his home each night, so he would be in a position to speed off to an emergency with all of his tools and equipment at hand. One afternoon, Edgar left the Edgewater Electric offices at 4 p.m. as usual. However, when he left the main highway, he did not turn left toward his home but instead turned right toward the supermarket a few blocks away to pick up some items for dinner. While leaving the supermarket parking lot, Edgar drove negligently and struck Parka, a pedestrian. Parka suffered serious injuries and required several operations and a lengthy hospital stay. Parka filed suit against Edgewater for $ 100,000$.\n\nIs Parka likely to recover from Edgewater?\n\n(A) Yes, because Edgar's trip to the market was only a slight deviation from the direct route to his home.\n\n(B) Yes, but only if Edgewater knew that Edgar had proclivities to drive negligently.\n\n(C) No, because turning in the opposite direction from his home constituted a \"frolic\" by Edgar.\n\n(D) No, because an employer is not liable for the torts of an employee traveling to and from work.\n\n\\section{Question 49}\n\nSmythe was charged with the murder of his wife. In his defense, he testified that, at the time he killed her, he believed that his wife was planning to destroy the world by detonating a massive explosive device that she had developed and built in the basement of their home. He further testified that he had tried many times to dissuade his wife from her plan and had tried to destroy devices that she stored in the basement. She had, he testified, foiled his efforts by, on two occasions, signing papers for his hospitalization, which lasted for a brief period each time. He said that he had concluded that the only way to prevent her scheme was to kill her and that he had become so obsessed with the importance of doing so that he could think of nothing else. One day when he saw her open the door to the basement, he lunged at her and pushed her down the steps to her death.\n\nThe best defense raised by Smythe's testimony is:\n(A) Lack of the requisite mental element.\n(B) Lack of the requisite act element.\n(C) Insanity.\n(D) Belief that the situation justified his ac- tions. \n\n\\section{Question 50}\n\nScholastica, the Academic Dean at Woodbine College, was well liked and considered a competent scholar and a fine teacher. However, six months after her appointment as Dean, Scholastica received a certified letter from Rector, the Provost of Woodbine College, summarily dismissing her. No reasons were given in the letter for Scholastica's dismissal. Scholastica had her lawyer, Loretta, contact Rector to discover the basis of her dismissal, if possible. Two days later, Loretta received a letter from Rector stating, in relevant part, \"Scholastica was dismissed from her employment at Woodbine College because I received an anonymous telephone call informing me that Scholastica was involved in selling drugs to students. One can't be too careful about these things in this day and age.\" Rector had, in fact, received such a phone call, but the basis of the statement was untrue, because Scholastica had never even used illegal drugs, much less sold them.\n\nIf Scholastica files suit against Rector for libel:\n\n(A) Scholastica will win, if Rector should have verified the anonymous statement before repeating it to Loretta.\n\n(B) Scholastica will lose, because by having her attorney ask the reason for the dismissal, Scholastica impliedly consented to the statement in the letter.\n\n(C) Rector will win, because Rector was merely repeating the defamatory communication of another.\n\n(D) Rector will lose, because Scholastica was not dealing in drugs.\n\n\\section{Question 51}\n\nRose was convicted in federal court of possession of one kilogram of heroin with intent to distribute. She was sentenced to a prison term. Subsequently, Rose was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same kilogram of heroin. She moved to dismiss the indictment.\n\nHer motion should be:\n\n(A) Denied, because the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply when the second prosecution is for violation of a separate statute.\n\n(B) Denied, because each prosecution requires proof of an element that the other does not.\n\n(C) Granted, because the Double Jeopardy Clause protects her against a second prosecution for the same criminal conduct.\n\n(D) Granted, because the Due Process Clause protects her against double punishment for the same criminal conduct.\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 52-53} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nThree states, East Winnetka, Midland, and West Hampton, are located next to one another in that order.

The state of Midland has a state statute that provides, \"Possession of snipe traps is prohibited.

In the course of her trip back across Midland with the trap in her car, Prentis stopped in a Midland state park to camp for a few nights.

It owned its own garage for repairing and maintaining its fleet. Behind this garage was a large vacant lot in which Cantebury Trails stored old, discarded, and wrecked buses, which it salvaged for parts or sold for scrap. This area was fenced in by a five-foot high chain link fence, but Cantebury was aware that children from the neighborhood would climb the fence and play among the junked buses. Consequently, Cantebury Trails would have one of its employees walk through the storage area sometime during the day to chase away any children who may have scaled the fence.\n\nOne Saturday afternoon, when Cantebury Trails' garage had closed for the weekend, a group of children climbed over the storage area's fence to play army among the junked buses. One of the children, Donny (who had been chased away from the lot before and who also had been warned by his parents not to play in these buses), was trying to climb on the roof of one of the old buses, when he slipped on the front bumper of the bus and his arm broke through the front windshield. As a result of this accident, Donny severed the tendon and nerves in his right arm, leaving it permanently disabled.\n\nThrough an appropriate guardian, Donny brought suit against Cantebury Trails for his injury.\n\nWhich of the following, if established, would most aid Donny in showing that Cantebury Trails breached a duty owing to him?\n\n(A) It would have been economically feasible to remove the windows from all the abandoned buses. (B) This area would be classified more as a residential neighborhood than an industrial area.\n\n(C) Cantebury Trails could have eliminated the risk of injury without unduly interfering with its normal operations.\n\n(D) Cantebury Trails improperly maintained the fence that surrounded the lot with the discarded and abandoned buses.\n\n\\section{Question 60}\n\nCars driven by Pugh and Davidson collided, and Davidson was charged with driving while intoxicated in connection with the accident.

At trial, Pugh offers the properly authenticated record of Davidson's conviction.\n\nThe record should be:\n(A) Admitted as proof of Davidson's character.\n(B) Admitted as proof of Davidson's intoxica- tion.\n(C) Excluded, because the conviction was not the result of a trial.\n(D) Excluded, because it is hearsay not within any exception. \n\n\\section{Question 61}\n\nIn which of the following situations is Defendant least likely to be guilty of burglary in a jurisdiction that has extended burglary to buildings other than dwellings but otherwise retains the common law requirements?\n\n(A) Defendant posed as a member of a cleaning crew so that a security guard would give him access to a department store after it was closed for the night, and then hid in a storage closet until the cleaning crew left. He then stole a quantity of jewelry from several jewelry cases, and forced open a loading dock door to escape from the building.\n\n(B) Defendant, intending to steal money and valuables from a house he believed was unoccupied for the evening, pushed open a mail slot and reached his hand in to try to unlock the front door. The owners' dog bit Defendant's hand and he immediately pulled it out and fled.\n\n(C) Defendant was owed $ 500$ by Victor, his bookie. While Victor was out of town one night, Defendant went to Victor's house to get his money, because he knew that Victor had $ 500$ in cash in a desk drawer and the debt was long overdue. Defendant opened an unlocked window and entered the house. He could not find the cash, so he decided to take a painting that he knew was worth substantially more than $ 500$. He later sold it for $ 1,000$ and kept the proceeds.\n\n(D) Defendant, a security officer in a housing project, saw Von, who was wanted on a warrant for drug dealing, through a window of an apartment one evening. He fired his gun at Von from the sidewalk, intending to injure him, although Defendant knew that he was not legally authorized to use deadly force in that situation.

Dow claimed that the tree was on city property and thus was the responsibility of the city. At trial, Pitt offered testimony that, a week after the accident, Dow had cut the tree down with a chainsaw.\n\nThe offered evidence is:\n(A) Inadmissible, because there is a policy to encourage safety precautions.\n(B) Inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to the condition of the tree at the time of the accident.\n(C) Admissible to show the tree was on Dow's property.\n(D) Admissible to show the tree was in a rotted condition. \n\n\\section{Question 63}\n\nTalbot and Rogers, as lessees, signed a valid lease for a house. Lane, the landlord, duly executed the lease and delivered possession of the premises to the lessees.\n\nDuring the term of the lease, Rogers verbally invited Andrews to share the house with the lessees. Andrews agreed to pay part of the rent to Lane, who did not object to this arrangement, despite a provision in the lease that provided that \"any assignment, subletting or transfer of any rights under this lease without the express written consent of the landlord is strictly prohibited, null and void.\" Talbot objected to Andrews's moving in, even if Andrews were to pay a part of the rent.\n\nWhen Andrews moved in, Talbot brought an appropriate action against Lane, Rogers, and Andrews for a declaratory judgment that Rogers had no right to assign. Rogers's defense was that he and Talbot were tenants in common of a term for years, and that he, Rogers, had a right to assign a fractional interest in his undivided onehalf interest.\n\nIn this action, Talbot will:\n\n(A) Prevail, because a co-tenant has no right to assign all or any part of a leasehold without the consent of all interested parties.\n\n(B) Prevail, because the lease provision prohibits assignment.\n\n(C) Not prevail, because he is not the beneficiary of the nonassignment provision in the lease.\n\n(D) Not prevail, because his claim amounts to a void restraint on alienation.\n\n\\section{Question 64}\n\nJohn Smith has denied his purported signature on a letter that has become critical in a breach of contract suit between Smith and Miller. At trial, Miller's counsel calls Alice, a teacher, who testifies that she taught John Smith mathematics in school 10 years earlier, knows his signature, and proposes to testify that the signature to the letter is that of John Smith. Smith's counsel objects.\n\nThe trial judge should:\n\n(A) Sustain the objection on the ground that identification of handwriting requires expert testimony and the teacher does not, per se, qualify as an expert.\n\n(B) Sustain the objection on the ground that the best evidence of Smith's handwriting would be testimony by a person who had examined his writing more recently than 10 years ago.\n\n(C) Overrule the objection on the ground that a schoolteacher qualifies as an expert witness for the purpose of identifying handwriting.\n\n(D) Overrule the objection on the ground that a layman may identify handwriting if he has seen the person in question write, and has an opinion concerning the writing in question. \n\n\\section{Question 65}\n\nHarold and Wanda, once married to each other, had gone through a bitter divorce. The divorce decree awarded custody of the couple's four-year-old son Jake to Wanda, with Harold receiving visitation rights. On the first opportunity that Harold had to take Jake for the weekend, Harold disappeared with Jake. Wanda was greatly distressed and called Harold's parents, Grandmaw and Grandpaw, on a weekly basis, always asking if they knew anything about the whereabouts of Harold and Jake. Grandmaw and Grandpaw knew quite well where Harold and Jake were, and they often sent money to help support Harold while he was on the run. However, they always insisted that they knew nothing about the child. Four years after Jake was abducted, the police arrested Harold and returned Jake to his mother.\n\nWanda files an action against Grandmaw and Grandpaw alleging infliction of emotional distress. Will Wanda prevail?\n\n(A) Yes, because Grandmaw and Grandpaw acted in deliberate disregard of a high probability that their actions would cause Wanda to suffer emotional distress.\n\n(B) Yes, but only if Grandmaw and Grandpaw actually knew that their actions would cause Wanda to suffer emotional distress.\n\n(C) No, unless Wanda can prove that she suffered physical harm.\n\n(D) No, because Wanda never was in a zone of danger.\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 66-68} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nAs part of a comprehensive federal aid-toeducation program, Congress included the following provisions as conditions for state receipt of federal funds: (1) Whenever textbooks are provided to students without charge, they must include no religious instruction and must be made available on the same terms to students in all public and private schools accredited by the state educational authority. (2) Salary supplements can be paid to teachers in public and private schools, up to $10 \\%$ of existing salary schedules, where present compensation is less than the average salary for persons of comparable training and experience, provided that no such supplement is paid to any teacher who instructs in religious subjects. (3) Construction grants can be made toward the cost of physical plants at private colleges and universities, provided that no part of the grant is used for buildings in which instruction in religious subject matters is offered."

Included in the deed to each unit was a covenant under which the grantee and the grantee's \"heirs and assigns\" agreed to purchase electrical power only from a plant Fernwood promised to build and maintain within the development. Fernwood constructed the plant and the necessary power lines. The plant did not supply power outside the development. An appropriate and fair formula was used to determine price.\n\nAfter constructing and selling 12,500 of the units, Fernwood sold its interest in the development to Gaint Realty Investors. Gaint operated the power plant and constructed and sold the remaining 12,500 units. Each conveyance from Gaint contained the same covenant relating to electrical power that Fernwood had included in the 12,500 conveyances it had made.\n\nPage bought a dwelling unit from Olm, who had purchased it from Fernwood. Subsequently, Page, whose lot was along the boundary of the Fernwood development, ceased buying electrical power from Gaint and began purchasing power from General Power Company, which provided such service in the area surrounding the Fernwood development. Both General Power and Gaint have governmental authorization to provide electrical services to the area. Gaint instituted an appropriate action against Page to enjoin her from obtaining electrical power from General Power.\n\nIf judgment is for Page, it most likely will be because:\n(A) The covenant does not touch and concern the land.\n(B) The mixture of types of residential units is viewed as preventing one common devel- opment scheme.\n\n(C) The covenant is a restraint on alienation.\n\n(D) There is no privity of estate between Page and Gaint.\n\n\\section{Question 95}\n\nAmy Docent, a state college instructor, was discharged because of her refusal to comply with a state statute requiring public employees to swear or affirm that they will (1) \"uphold and defend\" the state and federal constitutions, and (2) \"oppose the overthrow\" of the state or federal governments \"by force, violence, or by any improper method.\" The statute had previously been held constitutional by the state supreme court. Docent filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the statute and seeking an injunction and damages.\n\nWhich of the following is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the statute?\n(A) Government employment is a privilege, not a right.\n(B) The oath as a whole is only a commitment to abide by constitutional processes.\n(C) The First and Fourteenth Amendments permit a state to fix the conditions of state employment.\n(D) The state has a compelling need to keep disloyal persons out of governmental positions of trust. \n\n\\section{Questions 96-97} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nOn January 2, Hugh Homey and Sue Structo entered into a written contract in which Structo agreed to build on Homey's lot a new house for Homey, according to plans and specifications furnished by Homey's architect, Barbara Bilevel, at a contract price of $ 200,000$.

Verner was drunk and believed Dietz had a gun and was trying to rob him, but was unaware of Atkins behind him. Verner reached into his back pocket to hand over his wallet and was cut by Atkins's knife as it was slicing through his pocket. The wallet dropped to the ground as Verner clutched his hand. Atkins picked it up and Dietz and Atkins fled while Verner knelt on the ground in pain. Dietz was apprehended shortly thereafter and charged with robbery.\n\nShould Dietz be found guilty?\n(A) Yes, because Atkins obtained the property by means of force.\n(B) Yes, because Verner believed that Dietz would shoot him if he did not give up his wallet.\n(C) No, because neither Dietz nor Atkins intended to use force against Verner to obtain the property.\n(D) No, because Verner's belief that Dietz was robbing him was unreasonable. \n\n\\section{Question 113}\n\nProfessor Peterson, an expert on American Colonial and Revolutionary History, conducted full-day tours through the historic sites of Philadelphia every Wednesday and Thursday through the summer months. Peterson's fee for his services was $ 105$, which did not include the entrance fees for several of the historical sites. Other persons and organizations conducted various American history tours through the city for somewhat less than Peterson, but Peterson's tour was generally rated the best by the leading tourist guidebooks because Peterson personally conducted the tours and shared his encyclopedic knowledge of American history and the city of Philadelphia.\n\nDavid had recently moved to Philadelphia, and all of his co-workers praised Professor Peterson's tour, but David was not inclined to pay $ 105$ for a tour of the historical sites of his new city. Therefore, David took a day off one Thursday and \"hung around\" the Liberty Bell monument, where Peterson's tour started. That day Peterson was conducting 27 persons on the tour. Most of the participants had paid in advance, but Peterson was holding up a sign with information about the tour and handing out brochures, one of which David took. Peterson accepted a few additional participants who signed up on the spot, but David was not among them. All day long, David hung around at the fringe of this group, paying the entrance fees separately but following the group through the different historical sites. However, he always positioned himself close enough to Peterson's group so that he could hear virtually every word of Peterson's lecture, although David did not ask Peterson any questions. David signed his name and address on the register at Independence Hall. Peterson noted this and took down the information. Two days after the tour concluded, David received a bill from Peterson in the amount of $ 105$.\n\nDavid will most likely be required to pay Peterson: (A) $ 105$, because that is the contract price for the tour.\n\n(B) $ 105$, because the amount of the contract was less than $ 500$, making the Statute of Frauds inapplicable.\n\n(C) $ 105$, if that is a reasonable fee for the lectures based on Peterson's expertise.\n\n(D) Nothing, because the historical sites were open to the public and David paid his own way.\n\n\\section{Question 114}\n\nIn compliance with a federal statute requiring buildings to be made accessible to persons with disabilities, Walter installed wheelchair ramps at both entrances to his office building located on Blackacre, which he had owned for many years. One year later, Walter entered into a contract with Barbara to sell Blackacre, including the office building. After having the property surveyed, Barbara notified Walter that she was not going to complete the sale because the wheelchair ramp on the south side of the building extended over the property line and into the adjoining parcel of Whiteacre, making the title unmarketable. Walter insisted that Barbara proceed with the sale, and brought an action to compel her performance.\n\nIf the court were to find that title is marketable, it will be because:\n(A) The wheelchair ramp is required by federal law.\n(B) Walter currently owns Whiteacre and acquired Whiteacre and Blackacre as part of a larger parcel.\n(C) The wheelchair ramp extends only 10 inches over the property line.\n(D) The contract between Walter and Barbara requires Walter to convey only a quitclaim deed. \n\n\\section{Question 115}\n\nAn ordinance of City makes it unlawful to park a motor vehicle on a City street within 10 feet of a fire hydrant. At 1:55 p.m., Parker, realizing he must be in Bank before it closed at 2 p.m. and finding no other space available, parked his automobile in front of a fire hydrant on a City street. Parker then hurried into the bank, leaving his aged neighbor, Ned, as a passenger in the rear seat of the car. About five minutes later, and while Parker was still in Bank, Driver was driving down the street. Driver swerved to avoid what he mistakenly thought was a hole in the street and sideswiped Parker's car. Parker's car was turned over on top of the hydrant, breaking the hydrant and causing a small flood of water. Parker's car was severely damaged and Ned was badly injured. There is no applicable guest statute and the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules.\n\nIf Ned asserts a claim against Parker, the most likely result is that Ned will:\n\n(A) Recover, because Parker's action was negligence per se.\n\n(B) Recover, because Parker's action was a continuing wrong that contributed to Ned's injuries.\n\n(C) Not recover, because a reasonably prudent person could not foresee injury to Ned as a result of Parker's action.\n\n(D) Not recover, because a violation of a city ordinance does not give rise to a civil cause of action.\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 116-118} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nOn May 1, Ohner telegraphed Byer, \"Will sell you any or all of the lots in Grove subdivision at $ 5,000$ each.

Susan died in 1980 and Hubert married Waverly in 1982. At his death in 1990 , Green was survived by his wife, Waverly, and three children, Allan, Beth, and Carter. Carter, who was born in 1984, was his child by Waverly.\n\nIn a jurisdiction that recognizes the common law Rule Against Perpetuities unmodified by statute, the result of the application of the Rule is that the:\n\n(A) Remainder to the children and to the grandchildren is void because Green could have subsequently married a person who was unborn at the time Green executed his will.\n\n(B) Remainder to the children is valid, but the substitutionary gift to the grandchildren is void because Green could have subsequently married a person who was unborn at the time Green executed his will.\n\n(C) Gift in remainder to Allan and Beth or their children is valid, but the gift to Carter or his children is void.\n\n(D) Remainder to the children and the substitutionary gift to the grandchildren are valid.\n\n\\section{Question 124}\n\nDowns was indicted in state court for bribing a public official. During the course of the investigation, police had demanded and received from Downs's bank the records of Downs's checking account for the preceding two years. The records contained incriminating evidence. On the basis of a claim of violation of his constitutional rights, Downs moves to prevent the introduction of the records in evidence.

Just as Plummer was about to sit down at the head table, Devon pushed Plummer's chair to one side. As a result, Plummer fell to the floor. Plummer was embarrassed at being made to look foolish before a large audience but suffered no physical harm.\n\nIf Plummer asserts a claim against Devon for damages because of his embarrassment, will Plummer prevail?\n(A) Yes, if Devon knew that Plummer was about to sit on the chair.\n(B) Yes, if Devon negligently failed to notice that Plummer was about to sit on the chair.\n(C) No, because Plummer suffered no physical harm along with his embarrassment.\n(D) No, if in moving the chair Devon intended only a good-natured practical joke on Plummer. \n\n\\section{Question 126}\n\nPaulsen sued Daly for nonpayment of a personal loan to Daly, as evidenced by Daly's promissory note to Paulsen.

On direct examination, to identify himself, Walters gave his name and address and testified that he had been employed by a roofing company for seven years.\n\nDuring presentation of Daly's case, Daly called Wilson to testify that she is the roofing company's personnel manager and that she had determined, by examining the company's employment records, that Walters had worked there only three years.\n\nThe trial judge should rule that Wilson's testimony is:\n(A) Inadmissible, because it is not the best evidence.\n(B) Inadmissible, because it is impeachment on a collateral question.\n(C) Admissible as evidence of a regularly conducted activity.\n(D) Admissible as tending to impeach Walters's credibility.\n\n\\section{Question 127}\n\nA federal statute set up a program of dental education. The statute provided that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \"shall, on a current basis, spend all of the money appropriated for this purpose\" and \"shall distribute the appropriated funds\" by a specified formula to state health departments that agree to participate in the program. In the current year Congress appropriated $100 million for expenditure on this program.\n\nTo ensure a budget surplus in the current fiscal year, the President issued an executive order directing the various Cabinet Secretaries to cut expenditures in this year by $10 \\%$ in all categories. He also ordered certain programs to be cut more drastically because he believed that \"they are not as important to the general welfare as other programs.\" The President identified the dental education program as such a program and ordered it to be cut by $50 \\%$. Assume that no other federal statutes are relevant.\n\nTo satisfy constitutional requirements, how much money must the Secretary of Health and Human Services distribute for the dental education program this year?\n(A) $50 million, because the President could reasonably determine that this program is not as important to the general welfare as other programs.\n(B) $50 million, because as chief executive the President has the constitutional authority to control the actions of all of his subordi- nates by executive order.\n(C) $ 90$ million, because any more drastic cut for the program would be a denial of equal protection to beneficiaries of this program as compared to beneficiaries of other programs.\n(D) $100 million, because the President may not unilaterally suspend the effect of a valid federal statute imposing a duty to spend appropriated monies. \n\n\\section{Question 128}\n\nFour years ago, Owen held Blackacre, a tract of land, in fee simple absolute. In that year he executed and delivered to Price a quitclaim deed which purported to release and quitclaim to Price all of the right, title, and interest of Owen in Blackacre. Price accepted the quitclaim and placed the deed in his safe deposit box.\n\nOwen was indebted to Crider in the amount of $ 35,000$. In September of the current year, Owen executed and delivered to Crider a warranty deed, purporting to convey the fee simple to Blackacre, in exchange for a full release of the debt he owed to Crider. Crider immediately recorded his deed.\n\nIn December, Price caused his quitclaim deed to Blackacre to be recorded and notified Crider that he (Price) claimed title.\n\nAssume that there is no evidence of occupancy of Blackacre and assume, further, that the jurisdiction where Blackacre is situated has a recording statute which required good faith and value as elements of the junior claimant's priority. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the conflicting claims of Price and Crider?\n\n(A) Price cannot succeed, because the quitclaim deed through which he claims prevents him from being bona fide (in good faith).\n\n(B) The outcome will turn on the view taken as to whether Crider paid value within the meaning of the statute requiring this element.\n\n(C) The outcome will turn on whether Price paid value (a fact not given in the statement).\n\n(D) Price's failure to record until December of the current year estops him from asserting title against Crider.\n\n\\section{Question 129}\n\nBrown contended that Green owed him $ 6,000$. Green denied that he owed Brown anything. Tired of the dispute, Green eventually signed a promissory note by which he promised to pay Brown $ 5,000$ in settlement of their dispute.\n\nIn an action by Brown against Green on the promissory note, which of the following, if true, would afford Green the best defense?\n\n(A) Although Brown honestly believed that $ 6,000$ was owed by Green, Green knew that it was not owed.\n\n(B) Although Brown knew that the debt was not owed, Green honestly was in doubt whether it was owed.\n\n(C) The original claim was based on an oral agreement, which the Statute of Frauds required to be in writing.\n\n(D) The original claim was an action on a contract, which was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n\n\\section{Question 130}\n\nEllis, an electrical engineer, designed an electronic game known as Zappo. Ellis entered into a licensing agreement with Toyco under which Toyco agreed to manufacture Zappo according to Ellis's specifications and to market it and pay a royalty to Ellis.\n\nCarla, whose parents had purchased a Zappo game for her, was injured while playing with the game. Carla recovered a judgment against Toyco on the basis of a finding that the Zappo game was defective because of Ellis's improper design.\n\nIn a claim for indemnity against Ellis, will Toyco prevail?\n\n(A) Yes, because as between Ellis and Toyco, Ellis was responsible for the design of Zappo.\n\n(B) Yes, because Toyco and Ellis were joint tortfeasors.\n\n(C) No, because Toyco, as the manufacturer, was strictly liable to Carla.\n\n(D) No, if Toyco, by a reasonable inspection, could have discovered the defect in the design of Zappo. \n\n\\section{Question 131}\n\nDefendant was charged with murder. His principal defense was that he had killed in hot blood and should be guilty only of manslaughter. The judge instructed the jury that the state must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, that the killing was presumed to be murder, and that the charge could be reduced to manslaughter, and Defendant accordingly found guilty of this lesser offense, if Defendant showed by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the killing was committed in the heat of passion on sudden provocation. Defendant was convicted of murder. On appeal, he seeks a new trial and claims error in the judge's instructions to the jury.\n\nDefendant's conviction will most probably be:\n\n(A) Affirmed, because the judge carefully advised the jury of the state's obligation to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n(B) Affirmed, because Defendant's burden to show hot blood was not one of ultimate persuasion but only one of producing evidence to rebut a legitimate presumption.\n\n(C) Reversed, because the instruction put a burden on Defendant that denied him due process of law.\n\n(D) Reversed, because presumptions have a highly prejudicial effect and thus cannot be used on behalf of the state in a criminal case.\n\n\\section{Question 132}\n\nWhile on walking patrol in a commercial district in the early evening, Officer Murdoch noticed that a light was on in Walker's Machine Shop. Curious about what was going on inside, the officer tried to look through the window of the shop, but it had been painted on the inside so that only a strip about three inches at the top, eight feet above street level, was still transparent. Officer Murdoch quietly brought two trash cans from a neighboring business over to the window, stood on them and saw, through the strip of unpainted window, that the shop owner's son Tommy was inside with a friend, sucking white powder into his nose through a rolled up tube of paper from off a small mirror. Recognizing from his experience and training that Tommy was snorting cocaine, Officer Murdoch knocked at the front door to the shop, and Tommy let him in. Murdoch immediately arrested Tommy and his friend. In the back room of the shop through whose window he had peered, Murdoch found and seized several grams of cocaine, a razor blade, and a mirror.\n\nIn Tommy's subsequent prosecution for possession of cocaine, Tommy seeks to bar introduction of the cocaine, mirror, and razor blade into evidence. His motion will probably be:\n(A) Granted, because Officer Murdoch could not have known that Tommy was snorting cocaine absent a chemical test of the substance being snorted.\n(B) Granted, because Officer Murdoch violated Tommy's reasonable expectation of priva- cy.\n(C) Denied, because the search was incident to a valid arrest.\n(D) Denied, because Tommy consented to Officer Murdoch's entry into the shop. \n\n\\section{Question 133}\n\nParmott sued Dexter in an automobile collision case. At trial, Parmott wishes to show by extrinsic evidence that Wade, Dexter's primary witness, is Dexter's partner in a gambling operation.\n\nThis evidence is:\n(A) Admissible as evidence of Wade's character.\n(B) Admissible as evidence of Wade's possible bias in favor of Dexter.\n(C) Inadmissible, because criminal conduct can be shown only by admission or record of conviction.\n(D) Inadmissible, because bias must be shown on cross-examination and not by extrinsic evidence.\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 134-136} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nFarquart had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son Junior and Junior's fiancee a house on their wedding day, planned for June 10 of the following year. Pursuant to that promise, Farquart telephoned his old contractor-friend Sawtooth and made the following oral agreement-each making full and accurate written notes thereof:\n\nSawtooth was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by Farquart, and Farquart was to pay therefor $ 20$ per tree. Sawtooth agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of $ 18,000$. Farquart agreed to make payments of $ 2,000$ on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1 upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders, Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met. Sawtooth delivered the cut logs to Farquart in July, when he also began building the house. Farquart made three $ 2,000$ payments for the work done in July, August, and September, without requiring a certificate. Sawtooth worked through October, but no work was done from November 1 to the end of February because of bad weather; and Farquart made no payments during that period. Sawtooth did not object. On March 1, Sawtooth demanded payment of $ 2,000$; but Farquart refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. Sawtooth thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement."

Because of Josephs's adverse comment on her qualifications, Norris was not employed by Hospital.\n\nIf Norris asserts a claim based on defamation against Josephs, will Norris prevail?\n\n(A) Yes, because Josephs was mistaken in the facts on which he based his opinion of Norris's competence.\n\n(B) Yes, because Josephs's statement reflected adversely on Norris's professional competence.\n\n(C) No, if Norris authorized Hospital to make inquiry of her former employer.\n\n(D) No, if Josephs had reasonable grounds for his belief that Norris was not competent.\n\n\\section{Question 150}\n\nA 10-lot subdivision was approved by the proper governmental authority. The authority's action was pursuant to a map filed by Diaz, which included an undesignated parcel in addition to the 10 numbered lots. The shape of the undesignated parcel is different and somewhat larger than any one of the numbered lots. Subdivision building restrictions were imposed on \"all the lots shown on said map.\"\n\nDiaz contracts to sell the unnumbered lot, described by metes and bounds, to Butts. Is title to the parcel marketable?\n\n(A) Yes, because the undesignated parcel is not a lot to which the subdivision building restrictions apply. (B) Yes, because the undesignated parcel is not part of the subdivision.\n\n(C) No, because the undesignated parcel has never been approved by the proper governmental authority.\n\n(D) No, because the map leaves it uncertain whether the unnumbered lot is subject to the building restrictions.\n\n\\section{Question 151}\n\nOn March 15, Venus Viniferous entered into a written agreement with Tipple Winery that provided that Venus would sell 1,600 tons of tokay grapes to Tipple for $ 750$ per ton, delivery to be no later than November 1 of the same year. By November 1, Venus had delivered only 700 tons of grapes, and had informed Tipple by telegram that she had used the remainder of her crop in the production of her own boutique winery's latest release, Tokay With Me wine cooler. Tipple purchased an additional 900 tons of tokay grapes from other growers at the thenprevailing market price of $ 800$ per ton. Venus has submitted an invoice to the marketing department of Tipple for $ 525,000$. The head of marketing has come to you, Tipple's legal officer, for advice on how to respond to this billing.\n\nIgnoring incidental costs of cover, you should advise her to:\n\n(A) Pay the $ 525,000$, since by accepting delivery of the 700 tons of grapes Tipple waived an objection to Venus's breach.\n\n(B) Pay Venus the market value of her 700 tons of grapes as of November 1, less the cost of cover for the remaining 900 tons.\n\n(C) Pay Venus $ 480,000$, representing the contract price for the grapes she delivered less the cost of cover for the remaining 900 tons.\n\n(D) Pay Venus nothing, since she will be unable to enforce any claim for payment in court. \n\n\\section{Question 152}\n\nDray was prosecuted for bank robbery.

When he became aware of a sudden demand for beeswax for use in the manufacture of candles and certain types of exotic soaps sold in specialty shops, he built a plant to manufacture these items. The candle and soap business developed so rapidly that Barnes found it profitable to sell his bee farm to Stevens for $ 50,000$. The sale contract provided that \"Barnes reserves the right to purchase all of the beeswax produced by Stevens during the next five years at the current market price at time of delivery, delivery and payment to be made at weekly intervals, and Stevens agrees to supply in any event a minimum of 100 pounds of beeswax per month during that period.\"' When the sale was closed, Barnes's lawyer handed Stevens's lawyer a letter stating: \"This is to notify you that I will take all of your beeswax production until further notice.\"' For one year, Stevens delivered to Barnes and Barnes paid for all of the beeswax produced by Stevens. During that year, Stevens, who was an expert beekeeper, increased his beeswax production by $100 \\%$ by increasing the number and productivity of the bees. Stevens then proposed to Barnes that, since he had doubled production, it would only be fair that he supply Barnes with half of his new total, but in any event a minimum of 100 pounds per month, leaving Stevens free to sell the remainder of the wax at higher prices for new uses being made of beeswax. Barnes, in a signed writing, agreed to the proposal by Stevens for the remaining period of the original contract. During the following year, Stevens delivered to Barnes, and Barnes paid for, one-half of all of the beeswax produced by Stevens.\n\nAs the first year of the new contract ended, Stevens was stung by a bee and, due to an allergy, became so seriously and permanently ill and impaired as to be unable to attend to the bees. From that time on he never made another delivery to Barnes."

After Keith's arrest for selling cocaine out of his home, a felony, the state instituted an action of forfeiture against Keith's house and property. After notice to Keith and a hearing, a judge granted the order and the state seized the property. Six months later, after the time for any appeals had expired, the property was sold at a public auction to a third party. It was only when the third party brought an action to quiet title that Northwest Bank, the holder of a properly recorded mortgage on Keith's property, learned of the forfeiture. Because the bank's mortgage payments were automatically deducted from an account Keith had under a different name, no one at the bank was aware that the property had been seized. The only notice provided to parties other than Keith was a public notice published for three weeks in a general circulation newspaper. The bank defends the quiet title action on the ground that it did not receive the notice required under the United States Constitution to protect its interest in the property. If the court rules that Northwest Bank's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated by the state's seizure of the property, it will be because:\n\n(A) In any judicial proceeding affecting rights to real property, a claimant is required to provide notice and an evidentiary hearing to all parties with a legal interest in the property before taking actions affecting their rights.\n\n(B) The government itself was the party that seized the property, rather than a private party using governmental processes.\n\n(C) The notice was not adequate under the circumstances to apprise a party with a properly recorded legal interest in the property.\n\n(D) The jurisdiction treats the mortgagee as having title to the property rather than merely a lien. \n\n\\section{Question 156}\n\nDarren's car was stopped by Officer Jones for a minor traffic violation. The officer recognized Darren as a suspect in a multimillion-dollar bank fraud scheme that had just been discovered by the authorities. She placed Darren under arrest and gave him Miranda warnings. She then asked for permission to search the trunk of the car. Darren nodded and unlocked the trunk. Officer Jones searched the trunk and discovered a bag containing what appeared to be cocaine in a compartment in the trunk. When later tests determined that it was cocaine, the authorities added a charge of transporting illegal narcotics to Darren's indictment. At a preliminary hearing, Darren moved to have evidence of the cocaine excluded as the result of a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nShould the court grant Darren's motion?\n\n(A) Yes, because one taken into custody cannot give valid consent to a search that would otherwise require a warrant.\n\n(B) Yes, because the search exceeded the scope of a permissible search incident to a lawful arrest.\n\n(C) No, if the court finds that Darren's consent was voluntary under the circumstances.\n\n(D) No, because persons have a lesser expectation of privacy in their vehicles for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\\section{Question 157}\n\nIn which of the following situations is Defendant most likely to be guilty of the crime charged?\n\n(A) Without the permission of Owner, Defendant takes Owner's car with the intention of driving it three miles to a grocery store and back. Defendant is charged with larceny.\n\n(B) Defendant gets permission to borrow Owner's car for the evening by falsely promising to return it, although he does not intend to do so. Two days later, he changes his mind and returns the car. Defendant is charged with larceny by trick.\n\n(C) Defendant gets permission to borrow Owner's car for the evening by misrepresenting his identity and falsely claiming he has a valid driver's license. He returns the car the next day. Defendant is charged with obtaining property by false pretenses.\n\n(D) With permission, Defendant, promising to return it by 9 p.m., borrows Owner's car. Later in the evening, Defendant decides to keep the car until the next morning and does so. Defendant is charged with embezzlement. \n\n\\section{Questions 158-159} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nIn a trial between Jones and Smith, an issue arose about Smith's ownership of a horse, which had caused damage to Jones's crops."

The amount of the discharge from either plant alone would not have been sufficient to cause any harm to Landesmann's cattle.\n\nIf Landesmann asserts a claim against Acorp and Beeco, what, if anything, will Landesmann recover?\n\n(A) Nothing, because neither company discharged enough pesticide to cause harm to Landesmann's cattle.\n\n(B) Nothing, unless Landesmann can establish how much pesticide each plant discharged.\n\n(C) One-half of Landesmann's damages from each company.\n\n(D) The entire amount of Landesmann's damages, jointly and severally, from the two companies. \n\n\\section{Question 182}\n\nFor a valuable consideration, Amato, the owner of Riveracre, signed and gave to Barton a duly executed instrument that provided as follows: \"The grantor may or may not sell Riveracre during her lifetime, but at her death, or if she earlier decides to sell, the property will be offered to Barton at $ 500$ per acre. Barton shall exercise this right, if at all, within 60 days of receipt of said offer to sell.\" Barton recorded the instrument. The instrument was not valid as a will.\n\nIs Barton's right under the instrument valid?\n\n(A) Yes, because the instrument is recorded.\n\n(B) Yes, because Barton's right to purchase will vest or fail within the period prescribed by the Rule Against Perpetuities.\n\n(C) No, because Barton's right to purchase is a restraint on the owner's power to make a testamentary disposition.\n\n(D) No, because Barton's right to purchase is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\n\n\\section{Question 183}\n\nIn a contract suit by Perez against Drake, each of the following is an accepted method of authenticating Drake's signature on a document offered by Perez except:\n\n(A) A nonexpert who, in preparation for trial, has familiarized himself with Drake's usual signature testifies that, in his opinion, the questioned signature is genuine.\n\n(B) The jury, without the assistance of an expert, compares the questioned signature with an admittedly authentic sample of Drake's handwriting.\n\n(C) A witness offers proof that the signature is on a document that has been in existence for at least 20 years, that was in a place where it would likely be if it was authentic, and that has no suspicious circumstances surrounding it.\n\n(D) A witness testifies that Drake admitted that the signature was his. \n\n\\section{Question 184}\n\nThe industrial city of Tunbridge suffered from battles over gang turf and a rash of drive-by shootings. Most street gangs were affiliated with one of the two loose gang confederations that fought for dominance, the Assassins and the Ghouls. To \"issue a warning\" to the Ghouls, a carload of Assassins, armed with Uzi submachine guns, sped into the Ghouls' neighborhood. It was late at night when the car passed a corner store, around which the Ghouls were known to congregate during daylight hours. The Assassins knew that the store closed at 6 p.m. and that the Ghouls went elsewhere after nightfall. As the Assassins drove by, they sprayed the store with submachine gunfire, smashing the windows and pocking the brick exteriors. One of the bullets struck and killed Jamie, a six-yearold girl who was asleep in an apartment located on the second floor, above the corner store. A few days later, the police arrested Dennison, who admitted to being a member of the Assassins and to having been in the car when the Assassins shot up the store. Dennison was placed on trial for the murder of Jamie.\n\nIf Dennison takes the stand in his own defense, and the jury believes Dennison's testimony, which of the following assertions by Dennison would be his best defense to the murder charge?\n(A) \"I was the driver of the car and did not actually shoot into the building.\"\n(B) \"I took a lot of drugs that night, and I was so high that I don't even remember the incident; I was certainly in no condition to form an intent to kill somebody.\"\n(C) \"Another member of my gang pointed a gun at me. I was really scared that if I didn't shoot into the building I would be seriously injured or killed myself.\"\n(D) \"I believed that the building was aban- doned and had no idea that there would be people inside it.\"\n\n\n\n\\section{Questions 185-186} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nOrris had title to Brownacre in fee simple. Without Orris's knowledge, Hull entered Brownacre in 1950 and constructed an earthen dam across a watercourse. The earthen dam trapped water that Hull used to water a herd of cattle he owned. After 12 years of possession of Brownacre, Hull gave possession of Brownacre to Burns. At the same time, Hull also purported to transfer his cattle and all his interests in the dam and water to Burns by a document that was sufficient as a bill of sale to transfer personal property but was insufficient as a deed to transfer real property.\n\nOne year later, Burns entered into a lease with Orris to lease Brownacre for a period of five years. After the end of the five-year term of the lease, Burns remained on Brownacre for an additional three years and then left Brownacre. At that time Orris conveyed Brownacre by a quitclaim deed to Powell. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years."

The statute provides that, in issuing those rules, the agency must follow procedures and substantive standards contained in the statute. In a severable provision, the statute also provides that otherwise valid rules issued by the agency under authority delegated to it by this statute may be set aside by a majority vote of a designated standing joint committee of Congress.\n\nThe provision of this statute relating to the power of the designated standing joint committee of Congress is:\n\n(A) Constitutional, because it is a necessary and proper means of ensuring that the rules issued by this agency are actually consistent with the will of Congress.\n\n(B) Constitutional, because discretionary money grants authorized by statute are privileges, not rights, and, therefore, Congress has greater freedom to intervene in their administration than it has to intervene in the administration of regulatory laws. (C) Unconstitutional, because it denies equal protection of the laws to members of Congress who are not appointed to the joint legislative committee authorized to set aside rules of this agency.\n\n(D) Unconstitutional, because it authorizes a congressional change of legal rights and obligations by means other than those specified in the Constitution for the enactment of laws.\n\n\\section{Question 188}\n\nJohnson and Tenniel owned Brownacre as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Johnson executed a mortgage on Brownacre to Lowden to secure a loan. Subsequently, but before the indebtedness was paid to Lowden, Johnson died intestate with Stokes as her only heir at law. The jurisdiction in which Brownacre is located recognizes the title theory of mortgages.\n\nIn an appropriate action, the court should determine that title to Brownacre is vested:\n\n(A) In Tenniel, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.\n\n(B) In Tenniel, free and clear of the mortgage.\n\n(C) Half in Tenniel, free of the mortgage, and half in Stokes subject to the mortgage.\n\n(D) Half in Tenniel and half in Stokes, with both subject to the mortgage. \n\n\\section{Question 189}\n\nIn 1980 Omar, the owner in fee simple absolute, conveyed Stoneacre, a five-acre tract of land. The relevant, operative words of the deed conveyed to \"Church [a duly organized religious body having power to hold property] for the life of my son, Carl, and from and after the death of my said son, Carl, to all of my grandchildren and their heirs and assigns in equal shares; provided that Church shall use the premises for church purposes only.\"\n\nIn an existing building on Stoneacre, Church immediately began to conduct religious services and other activities normally associated with a church.\n\nIn 1995, Church granted to Darin a right to remove sand and gravel from a one-half acre portion of Stoneacre upon the payment of royalty. Darin has regularly removed sand and gravel since 1995 and paid a royalty to Church. Church has continued to conduct religious services and other church activities on Stoneacre.\n\nAll four of the living grandchildren of Omar, joined by a guardian ad litem to represent unborn grandchildren, instituted suit against Church and Darin seeking damages for the removal of sand and gravel and an injunction preventing further acts of removal. There is no applicable statute.\n\nWhich of the following best describes the likely disposition of this lawsuit?\n\n(A) The plaintiffs should succeed, because the interest of Church terminated with the first removal of sand and gravel.\n\n(B) Church and Darin should be enjoined, and damages should be recovered but impounded for future distribution.\n\n(C) The injunction should be granted, but damages should be denied, because Omar and Carl are not parties to the action.\n\n(D) Damages should be awarded, but the injunction should be denied.\n\n\\section{Question 190}\n\nDefendant, a worker in a metal working shop, had long been teasing Vincent, a young colleague, by calling him insulting names and ridiculing him. One day Vincent responded to the teasing by picking up a metal bar and attacking Defendant. Defendant could have escaped from the shop. He parried the blow with his left arm, and with his right hand struck Vincent a blow on his jaw from which the young man died.\n\nWhat is the most serious offense of which Defendant could be properly convicted?\n(A) Involuntary manslaughter.\n(B) Voluntary manslaughter.\n(C) Murder.\n(D) None of the above.\n\n\\section{Question 191}\n\nDean, charged with murder, was present with her attorney at a preliminary examination when White, who was the defendant in a separate prosecution for concealing the body of the murder victim, testified for the prosecution against Dean. When called to testify at Dean's trial, White refused to testify, although ordered to do so.\n\nThe prosecution offers evidence of White's testimony at the preliminary examination. The evidence is:\n(A) Admissible as former testimony.\n(B) Admissible as past recollection recorded.\n(C) Inadmissible, because it would violate White's privilege against self-incrimina- tion.\n(D) Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any exception. \n\n\\section{Question 192}\n\nThe town of Hometown had a municipal auditorium that all groups were permitted to use. Lately, Bhagwan Bigbucks has begun to hold recruiting seminars for his religious cult at the auditorium. Sensing the displeasure of the voting public and fearing that the auditorium would become a mecca of fringe religious groups, the Hometown Town Council adopted the following ordinance: \"Effective immediately, no religious groups will be permitted to use the Municipal Auditorium for meetings, speeches, or other public gatherings.\"\n\nBigbucks, who was having great success recruiting followers in Hometown, challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance in federal court. His suit should:\n\n(A) Fail, because the ordinance treats all religions equally.\n\n(B) Fail, because continuing to allow religious groups to use the auditorium would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\n(C) Succeed, because \"religious groups\" is an unconstitutionally vague term.\n\n(D) Succeed, unless Hometown can show that the ordinance serves a compelling government interest.\n\n\\section{Question 193}\n\nLight Company is the sole distributor of electrical power in City. The company owns and maintains all of the electric poles and equipment in City. Light Company has complied with the National Electrical Safety Code, which establishes minimum requirements for the installation and maintenance of power poles. The Code has been approved by the federal and state governments.\n\nLight Company has had to replace insulators on its poles repeatedly because unknown persons repeatedly shoot at and destroy them. This causes the power lines to fall to the ground. On one of these occasions, Paul, Faber's five-yearold son, wandered out of Faber's yard, intentionally touched a downed wire, and was seriously burned.\n\nIf a claim on Paul's behalf is asserted against Light Company, the probable result is that Paul will:\n\n(A) Recover if Light Company could have taken reasonable steps to prevent the lines from falling when the insulators were destroyed.\n\n(B) Recover, because a supplier of electricity is strictly liable in tort.\n\n(C) Not recover unless Light Company failed to exercise reasonable care to stop the destruction of the insulators.\n\n(D) Not recover, because the destruction of the insulators was intentional. \n\n\\section{Question 194}\n\nSantos agreed to sell and Perrine agreed to buy a described lot on which a single-family residence had been built. Under the contract, Santos agreed to convey marketable title subject only to conditions, covenants, and restrictions of record and all applicable zoning laws and ordinances. The lot was subject to a 10 -foot side line setback originally set forth in the developer's duly recorded subdivision plot. The applicable zoning ordinance zones the property for single-family units and requires an 8.5-foot side line setback.\n\nPrior to closing, a survey of the property was made. It revealed that a portion of Santos's house was $8.4$ feet from the side line.\n\nPerrine refused to consummate the transaction on the ground that Santos's title is not marketable. In an appropriate action, Santos seeks specific performance.\n\nWho will prevail in such an action?\n(A) Santos, because any suit against Perrine concerning the setback would be frivolous.\n(B) Santos, because the setback violation falls within the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex.\n(C) Perrine, because any variation, however small, amounts to a breach of contract.\n(D) Perrine, because the fact that Perrine may be exposed to litigation is sufficient to make the title unmarketable.\n\n\\section{Question 195}\n\nAccording to a statute of the state of Kiowa, a candidate for state office may have his name placed on the official election ballot only if he files with the appropriate state official a petition containing a specified number of voter signatures. Roderick failed to get his name placed on the state ballot as an independent candidate for governor because he failed to file a petition with the number of voter signatures required by state statute. In a suit against the appropriate state officials in federal district court, Roderick sought an injunction against the petition signature requirement on the ground that it was unconstitutional.\n\nWhich of the following, if established, constitutes the strongest argument for Roderick?\n(A) Compliance with the petition signature requirement is burdensome.\n(B) The objectives of the statute could be satisfactorily achieved by less burdensome means.\n(C) Because of the petition signature require- ment, very few independent candidates have ever succeeded in getting on the ballot.\n(D) The motivation for the statute was a desire to keep candidates off the ballot if they did not have strong support among voters. \n\n\\section{Question 196}\n\nAlford was a suspect in a homicide committed during a robbery of a liquor store. Barber was a friend of Alford. Police telephoned Barber and asked if he would help locate Alford. Barber agreed and met the police officers at headquarters later that night.\n\nAfter a discussion during which police asked questions about Alford and the homicide, Barber said that he wanted to get something \"off his chest\" and advised the officers that he was in on the robbery but that Alford had shot the owner of the store without his permission or prior knowledge. The officers then for the first time gave Barber his Miranda warnings.\n\nBarber was indicted for felony murder. He moved to prevent the introduction of his statement into evidence. His motion should be:\n\n(A) Granted, because Barber was effectively in custody and entitled to receive Miranda warnings at the beginning of the discussion.\n\n(B) Granted, because Barber's right to counsel and due process were violated by the interrogation at police headquarters.\n\n(C) Denied, because his statement was freely and voluntarily given and he was not entitled to Miranda warnings.\n\n(D) Denied, because by visiting headquarters voluntarily, Barber waived his right to have Miranda warnings at the beginning of the discussion.\n\n\\section{Question 197}\n\nAstin left her car at Garrison's Garage to have repair work done. After completing the repairs, Garrison took the car out for a test drive and was involved in an accident that caused damages to Placek.\n\nA statute imposes liability on the owner of an automobile for injuries to a third party that are caused by the negligence of any person driving the automobile with the owner's consent. The statute applies to situations of this kind, even if the owner did not specifically authorize the mechanic to test-drive the car.\n\nPlacek sued Astin and Garrison jointly for damages arising from the accident. In that action, Astin cross-claims to recover from Garrison the amount of any payment Astin may be required to make to Placek. The trier of fact has determined that the accident was caused solely by negligent driving on Garrison's part, and that Placek's damages were $ 100,000$.\n\nIn this action, the proper outcome will be that:\n\n(A) Placek should have judgment for $ 50,000$ each against Astin and Garrison; Astin should recover nothing from Garrison.\n\n(B) Placek should have judgment for $ 100,000$ against Garrison only.\n\n(C) Placek should have judgment for $ 100,000$ against Astin and Garrison jointly, and Astin should have judgment against Garrison for $50 \\%$ of any amount collected from Astin by Placek.\n\n(D) Placek should have judgment for $ 100,000$ against Astin and Garrison jointly, and Astin should have judgment against Garrison for any amount collected from Astin by Placek. \n\n\\section{Questions 198-199} are based on the following fact situation:\n\nAlthough by all appearances Herb and Edna, an elderly couple, were destitute, they had, in fact, substantial cash in the bank.

However, construction of the streets, utilities, and other aspects of the development of Meadowview has not yet begun, and none of the streets can be opened as public ways until they are completed in accordance with the applicable ordinances of the municipality in which Meadowview is located.\n\nCollege Avenue, one of the streets laid out as part of the Meadowview development, abuts Whiteacre, an adjacent one-acre parcel owned by White. Whiteacre has no access to any public way except an old, poorly developed road which is inconvenient and cannot be used without great expense. White sold Whiteacre to Breyer. The description used in the deed from White to Breyer was the same as that used in prior deeds except that the portion of the description which formerly said, \"thence by land of Black, northeasterly a distance of 200 feet, more or less,\" was changed to \"thence by College Avenue as laid out on the Plan of Meadowview North $16^{\\circ}$ East $201.6$ feet,\" with full reference to the plan and as recording data.\n\nBreyer now seeks a building permit which will show that Breyer intends to use College Avenue for access to Whiteacre. Black objects to the granting of a building permit on the grounds that he has never granted any rights to White or Breyer to use College Avenue. There are no governing statutes or ordinances relating to the problem. Black brings an appropriate action in which the right of Breyer to use College Avenue without an express grant from Black is at issue.\n\n\n\nThe best argument for Breyer in this action is that:",

            "Problem Statement": "Auto Company, a corporation, was a small dealer in big new cars and operated a service department. Peter wanted to ask Mike, the service manager, whether Auto Company would check the muffler on his small foreign car. Peter parked on the street near the service department with the intention of entering that part of the building by walking through one of the three large entrances designed for use by automobiles. There was no street entrance to the service department for individuals, and customers as well as company employees often used one of the automobile entrances.\n\nAs Peter reached the building, he glanced behind him to be sure no vehicle was approaching that entrance. Seeing none, he walked through the entrance, but immediately he was struck on the back of the head and neck by the large overhead door which was descending. The blow knocked Peter unconscious and caused permanent damage.\n\nPeter did not know how the door was raised and lowered; however, the overhead door was operated by the use of either of two switches in the building. One switch was located in the office of the service manager and the other was located near the door in the service work area for the convenience of the mechanics. On this occasion, no one was in the service work area except three Auto Company mechanics. Mike, who had been in his office, and the three mechanics denied having touched a switch that would have lowered the door. Subsequent investigation showed, however, that the switches were working properly and that all of the mechanisms for moving the door were in good working order.

Because of the manner in which Mobilco designed the ventilating system, the first time the ventilating system was operated by Parents, cold air was vented into Parents' bedroom to keep the temperature at $68^{\\circ}$ $\\mathrm{F}\\left(20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$. The cold air then activated the heater thermostat, and hot air was pumped into the bedroom of Child, the six-month-old child of Parents. The temperature in Child's room reached more than $170^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}\\left(77^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$ before Child's mother became aware of the condition and shut the system off manually. As a result, Child suffered permanent physical injury.\n\nClaims have been asserted by Child, through a duly appointed guardian, against Mobilco, Seller, Heatco, and Coolco.\n\n\n\nIf Child's claims against Mobilco, Heatco, and Coolco are based on strict liability in tort, Child will probably recover against:",
