Questions 1-6 are based on the following passage.

Passage I

Leukemia is a term that describes a wide variety of blood cell cancers. Most leukemia cases involve elevated leukocyte counts. In acute cases of leukemia, immature leukocytes proliferate quickly, which leads to many abnormal immature cells in the bone marrow. This inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce healthy new leukocytes. This form of the cancer progresses rapidly, and the cells metastasize easily as they move into the bloodstream from the bone marrow. It can be fatal within weeks or months if not treated promptly. In contrast, chronic cases of leukemia typically involve the proliferation of abnormal mature leukocytes. This form of the disease progresses more slowly, and treatment need not always be immediate.

Once classified as acute or chronic, leukemia can be further subdivided into lymphocytic or myelogenous. This distinction depends on which type of leukocyte is abnormal in the patient. In lymphocytic leukemia, the lymphoid cells, such as the lymphocytes, are abnormal. In the myelogenous form, the myeloid cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils, are affected.

Chemotherapy drugs are often used in the management of leukemia cases. There are numerous categories of these drugs, and they have varied mechanisms of action. In treatment, several drugs are used in combination because some of the drugs are cell-cycle specific while others are not. Alkylating agents are capable of disrupting the function of DNA. Tubulin-binding agents are designed to interfere with microtubule formation. Other drugs are designed to interfere with DNA polymerase, DNA repair mechanisms, or protein synthesis, or to act as purine analogs. Many of these drugs cannot enter into the brain when injected or ingested, so if the cancer has spread to

Practice Test 1 this area, special methods must be used to introduce the drugs to the brain.

1. What would be the BEST explanation as to why people with chronic forms of leukemia can live longer untreated than those with acute cases of leukemia?

A. Chronic cases involve types of leukocytes that have less important functions in the body.

B. Chronic cases of leukemia involve abnormal cell division of mature cells, so there are still some immature cells that can proliferate into normal mature cells.

C. The immune system is less likely to recognize and destroy abnormal immature leukocytes than it would be to recognize and destroy abnormal mature leukocytes.

B. These drugs are so toxic that they are broken down before they reach the brain.

C. Most of these drugs target only cancerous cells that normally would not be in the brain.

D. The drugs that have been ingested have likely been denatured by the acids in the stomach.

3. A variety of risk factors exist for leukemia. Some of these factors include exposure to radiation, certain viral infections, and inherited tendencies. What do all of these factors have in common?

D. alkylating agents

6. It is not uncommon for leukemia patients to receive stem cell transplants. Why might this be a productive treatment option?
A. The stem cells are capable of differentiating into new blood cells, which include the leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets.
B. The stem cells can damage and replace the cancerous leukocytes.
C. The stem cells can act as immune system modulators, enhancing the function of the entire system.
D. The stem cells can temporarily replace the function of the cancerous cells and slow down the progression of the disease.

Questions 7-12 are based on the following passage.

Passage II

The kidneys are responsible for filtering certain components of blood and producing urine from them. In an adult, the kidneys are typically capable of processing about 1 to $1.5$ liters of water per hour depending on the individual and conditions within the body. In a condition known as water intoxication, a person ingests more water (usually 3 or more liters in a single sitting) in a shorter period of time than the kidneys can process. In a child, the amount of water required to induce water intoxication is much less.

As the excess water moves from the digestive system, it accumulates in the plasma and extracellular fluids. Electrolytes such as sodium are drawn out of the cells in an attempt to equilibrate the concentrations inside and outside of the cells. As more and more water enters the extracellular fluids, the plasma sodium concentration drops, leading to a condition called hyponatremia, defined as a plasma sodium concentration less than $130 \mathrm{mmol} /$ liter. Due to the effects of osmosis, water begins entering the cells. The cells will begin to swell and may eventually burst, if the condition is not reversed in a timely manner.

The situation becomes increasingly problematic as the cells and tissues of the central nervous system take in more water. Pressure builds in the brain that causes symptoms that resemble alcohol intoxication. Lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, and headaches are typical as well. Damage can also occur in the lungs and heart. If not treated promptly, seizures, coma, and death can occur within several hours. SECTION 1:

Passage III

Sperm count in human males is influenced by a variety of factors. One of the most important variables affecting sperm count is the number of Sertoli cells located in seminiferous tubules of the testes. The Sertoli cells' primary function is to nurture cells through the process of spermatogenesis by providing them with nutrients and an environment conducive to spermatogenesis. Each Sertoli cell has a set number of spermatozoa that it can support. Sertoli cells have an additional role in forming the blood-testis barrier that provides immune privilege for the seminiferous tubules. This forms a physical barricade that keeps the developing sperm from coming into contact with cells of the immune system.

While it is not clear as to all the factors involved in determining Sertoli cell number, it is apparent that their development is most critical during the first nine months of life and prior to puberty. Events that affect the development of Sertoli cells in young males can influence fertility later in life. There may also be genetic factors involved in determining the number of Sertoli cells formed in a particular male.

The following data were collected from two groups of men. The men in group 1 had a normal sperm count while the men in group 2 were seeking infertility treatment due to a low sperm count. Levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary were measured as were the testicular hormones inhibin-B and testosterone in an attempt to determine which hormones seem to be linked to reduced sperm count.

\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
\hline Sample Group & LH & FSH & Inhibin-B & Testosterone \\
\hline 1 & $5.3 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{L}$ & $5.0 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{L}$ & $190 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ & $18.0 \mathrm{nmol} / \mathrm{L}$ \\
2 & $3.1 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{L}$ & $17.6 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{L}$ & $51 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ & $17.8 \mathrm{nmol} / \mathrm{L}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

B. to prevent the developing sperm cells from leaving the reproductive system

C. to prevent blood from flowing into the testes

D. to keep the developing sperm cells from entering into the epididymis before they are mature

17. The hormones FSH and LH are also involved in oogenesis in women. When LH surges in the ovarian cycle, what event will result?
A. endometrium proliferation
B. ovulation
C. menstruation
D. corpus luteum degradation

18. Fully differentiated Sertoli cells lose the ability to proliferate to produce more Sertoli cells. This would mean that they cannot perform:
A. mitosis
B. meiosis
C. apoptosis
D. binary fission

Questions 19-24 are based on the following passage.

Passage IV

Osteomyelitis is a bone infection often caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, which spreads through the blood to the bones. The infection is quite common after surgeries when soft tissues become infected and the infection moves to the adjacent bones. The long bones of children are particularly susceptible as they have excellent circulation to them during the growth period. In adults, the best circulation is to the vertebrae, and these are the bones that are most likely to develop osteomyelitis.

Osteomyelitis is treated with various antibiotics, but some patients have chronic infections that are not eradicated by antibiotic therapy due to a unique feature of S. aureus. S. aureus can be internalized by osteoblasts where the bacteria can continue to survive in the intracellular environment. Inside the osteoblasts, bacteria can induce apoptosis, killing their host cell. Surgical debridement is often required to remove the damaged and dead bone tissue created by the infection.

A major research question deals with how an S. aureus infection induces apoptosis in the host osteoblasts. In order for apoptosis to initiate in osteoblasts, the enzyme capsase-8 must be activated. This enzyme serves as a protease that cleaves critical proteins in the cell, causing cell death. Capsase-8 is only expressed under certain circumstances. In the case of osteomyelitis, the S. aureus bacteria cause the induction of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in the osteoblasts. Then TRAIL activates capsase-8, which triggers a series of events leading to apoptosis and death of osteoblasts.

19. Which of the following potential drugs might be helpful in preventing the death of osteoblasts caused by S. aureus infection?
A. one that increases capsase-8 activity
B. one that increases TRAIL activity
C. one that is an antagonist to TRAIL
D. all of the above

20. Osteoblasts are unusual in that they actively engulf $S$. aureus, which survives in the osteoblast and eventually triggers apoptosis. In engulfing the bacteria, the osteoblasts resemble the normal activities of which type of leukocyte?
A. basophils
B. lymphocytes
C. eosinophils
D. macrophages

21. Osteomyelitis begins when S. aureus enters the bloodstream and moves to the bones. Under normal conditions, the nonspecific immune defense that would be activated as bacteria enter the blood would be:
A. antibody production by plasma cells
B. cytotoxic T-cell activation
C. the complement system
D. interleukin secretion

SECTION 1:

Practice Test 1 

22. Many strains of $S$. aureus that cause osteomyelitis are termed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These strains have developed resistance to the antibiotic methicillin as well as to other antibiotics. The mechanism by which this antibiotic resistance occurs is by:

A. the overuse of antibiotics, which causes patients to become resistant to the antibiotics

B. the overuse of antibiotics, which selects for bacteria that have mutations that allow them to survive in the presence of the antibiotics

C. mutations, which occur as the bacteria are exposed to antibiotics that can serve as mutagens

D. all of the above

23. The strains of $S$. aureus associated with osteomyelitis have a variety of cell adhesion molecules called adhesins that help them to attach to and be internalized by osteoblasts. These molecules are likely found in which of the following bacterial structures?
A. the nucleoid
B. the ribosomes
C. the capsule
D. spores

24. Osteoblasts are normally involved in building new bone matrix. Their activity is stimulated by the hormone made by the

B. parathyroid hormone; parathyroid glands
C. osteotonin; bone marrow
D. none of the above

Questions 25-30 are based on the following passage.

Passage V

Endothelin is a vasoactive peptide involved in a variety of processes, including the control of blood flow. Endothelin is capable of binding to two different receptors. There are receptors for endothelin located on smooth muscle (ETA) and receptors for endothelin located on vascular endothelium (ETB). When endothelin binds to ETA, it initiates vasoconstriction by narrowing blood vessels. However, when endothelin binds to ETB, vasodilation occurs due to the widening of blood vessels. The activity of the ETB receptor seems to counterregulate the ETA effects and prevents excessive vasoconstriction.

Drug $X$ is a selective receptor antagonist for endothelin. It is designed to bind preferentially to certain endothelin receptors. Drug $\mathrm{Y}$ is another selective receptor antagonist for endothelin. It is also designed to preferentially bind to one of the endothelin receptors. Researchers are hopeful that drugs $\mathrm{X}$ and $\mathrm{Y}$ will be of value in the treatment of conditions such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In PAH, excess endothelin is produced, which causes an increase in blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries. Normal pressure in the pulmonary arteries is expected to be about $14 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, and pressure at or above $25 \mathrm{~mm}$ Hg constitutes PAH. Both drugs have been tested in patients with PAH. There were five patients in each group. At the end of the study, the percent decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure was measured for each patient and reported in the table.

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hline Patient & Drug X & DrugY & Placebo \\
\hline 1 & $+10 \%$ & $-10 \%$ & $+5 \%$ \\
2 & $+3 \%$ & $-5 \%$ & $0 \%$ \\
3 & $-5 \%$ & $+2 \%$ & $+13 \%$ \\
4 & $+2 \%$ & $0 \%$ & $-4 \%$ \\
5 & $0 \%$ & $-7 \%$ & $-2 \%$ \\
Average decrease & $+2 \%$ & $-4 \%$ & $+2.4 \%$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

25. Based solely on the data provided, which conclusion should be drawn concerning the effectiveness of drugs $\mathrm{X}$ and $\mathrm{Y}$ ?
A. Drug X is a more effective treatment for PAH because most patients had a slight or no increase in pulmonary blood pressure while taking the drug.
B. The placebo is the best treatment for PAH because some patients taking the placebo had a decrease in pulmonary blood pressure.
C. Drugs $\mathrm{X}$ and $\mathrm{Y}$ should be used as combined therapy to maximize their effects.
D. Drug $\mathrm{Y}$ is a more effective treatment for $\mathrm{PAH}$ because the majority of patients taking the drug had a decrease in pulmonary blood pressure.

26. Which endothelin receptor is drug X selectively binding to?
A. ETA only
B. ETB only
C. both ETA and ETB
D. neither ETA nor ETB

A. It should remain the same as long as the ETA receptor is also expressed.

B. It should decrease due to elevated levels of vasodilation.

C. It should increase since overexpression of ETB will block available ETA receptors.

D. It should stay stable since other systems in the body will compensate.

29. Suppose a patient suffers from chronic systolic and diastolic hypertension due to an inherited defect in an endothelin receptor. How would the kidneys attempt to alleviate the hypertension?

A. by decreasing water absorption in the nephrons

B. by decreasing urine output thus increasing blood volume

C. by increasing the amount of aldosterone secreted from the adrenal glands

D. by increasing the amount of antidiuretic hormone secreted from the pituitary gland

30. In addition to regulation of vessel diameter, ETA is known to have other roles in the body. When activated by a specific type of endothelin, ETA can synergize with growth factors to cause rapid cell proliferation. Based on this information, it is MOST likely that ETA can be involved with:

A. an increase in metabolism

B. the development of cancer

C. immune system hypersensitivities

D. increased stress to the kidneys and liver

Questions 31-36 are based on the following passage.

Passage VI

An endocrinologist has been studying an enzyme that she suspects is the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cholesterol to estrogen. It is reported in the literature that female mice with a mutation in the gene coding for this enzyme reach sexual maturity earlier than mice without the mutation. Controlled experiments are completed using breeding pairs of wild-type mice and the mutant strain of mice. The plasma estrogen concentration is measured in female offspring at 3 weeks of age, prior to sexual maturity, which typically occurs by 6 weeks of age. The results, in estrogen $\mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ of plasma, are seen in the following table. 

\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline Trial & Wild Type* & Mutant Strain* \\

Questions 37-42 are based on the following passage.

Passage VII

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is known to infect T cells and macrophages possessing the CD4 receptor. In addition to the CD4 receptor, there are a variety of coreceptors that are also needed for certain strains of HIV to infect cells. One of these coreceptors is called CCR5 and is needed for the most common strains of HIV (called R5) to infect their host cells. The more CCR5 receptors a cell has, the greater the rate of infection for the cell. Some individuals have the delta-32 allele of CCR5 that leads to a decreased risk of HIV infection.

Women are at a much higher risk for contracting HIV from a male partner than a male is for contracting HIV from a female partner. Some of the increased risk for women is dependent on sex hormones. It has been hypothesized that women have different risks of contracting HIV at different points in their reproductive cycles. For example, women may be at a greater risk of contracting HIV following ovulation during the last 2 weeks of their cycle as opposed to the first 2 weeks of their cycle prior to ovulation. The difference between risk of infection before and after ovulation relates to sex hormones produced at various points in the reproductive cycle. It seems that the estrogen that is produced prior to ovulation provides a somewhat protective, although certainly not absolute, role against HIV infection. For women who do become infected with HIV, studies have shown that women in the first 3 to 5 years after HIV infection carry lower HIV viral loads than men, perhaps due to the influence of estrogen. This suggests a major role for sex hormones in the infection and progression of HIV.

37. According to the hypothesis presented concerning estrogen's role in HIV infection, which of these individuals would be at LEAST risk for HIV infection?
A. a female producing elevated levels of testosterone
B. a female with an ovarian tumor that causes increased secretion of estrogen
C. a female who has had her ovaries removed
D. a male with a reduced testosterone level

38. Women are at a higher risk of contracting HIV following ovulation. Based on the normal events of the female reproductive cycle, which hormone might account for the increased risk of HIV infection in women following ovulation?
A. increased levels of progesterone
B. increased levels of follicle-stimulating hormone
C. increased levels of estrogen
D. increased levels of luteinizing hormone

39. As a result of chronic infection with HIV, the CCR5 gene is generally up-regulated over time. This would MOST likely account for:
A. an increased number of host cells becoming infected as the result of prolonged infection
B. the elimination of HIV from the body in some individuals
C. increased protection in women as the result of estrogen
D. resistance of cells carrying the CCR5 receptor to infection

40. Some populations with the delta-32 CCR5 mutation seem to have close to $100 \%$ protection against HIV, while other populations with the delta-32 CCR5 mutation seem to have only partial protection. What could account for this difference?
A. There is an environmental influence on expression of the delta-32 CCR5 phenotype.
B. The delta-32 CCR5 allele exhibits incomplete dominance. Homozygotes have complete protection while heterozygotes have only partial protection.
C. The expression of the delta-32 CCR5 allele can be masked by epistasis.
D. Those that have only partial protection against HIV infection have been exposed to larger doses of HIV.

41. HIV belongs to a unique category of viruses termed retroviruses. Which of the following enzymes would be unique to retroviruses?

Questions 43-48 are based on the following passage.

Passage VIII

In the past, there has been a great deal of controversy over the existence of viable but nonculturable (VBNC) states in bacteria. While normal culturing methods cannot detect these VBNC cells, there are a variety of molecular assays that can be used to indicate metabolic activity in the cells. Additionally, these cells can be resuscitated from VBNC states to a culturable state under appropriate conditions. The VBNC state has been observed in numerous species of bacteria and most recently in yeasts.

Escherichia coli is one of many species of bacteria that are able to enter and resuscitate from VBNC states. Certain strains of $E$. coli cause a variety of infections in humans. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are frequently caused by $E$. coli that exist as harmless residents in the intestinal tract. These infections can be treated using antibiotics to kill the E. coli. However, about 30 percent of women treated for UTIs end up with a recurrence. For those who support the VBNC theory, it has been hypothesized that recurrent UTIs are caused by VBNC E. coli that resuscitate to initiate a new infection. These VBNC cells may not be killed using antibiotic therapies normally used to treat UTIs. Only culturable cells cause the symptoms of a UTI.

The following graph shows the number of E. coli bacteria present in a patient following antibiotic therapy for a UTI. Day 1 indicates the number of bacteria present at diagnosis. A urine sample was collected each day and cultured for the presence of E. coli as measured in colony-forming units per milliliter of urine (cfu/ml). An assay was also used to determine the number of metabolically active cells that were potentially alive but not culturable (VBNC). The data are as follows:

43. What can you conclude from the graph?

A. Antibiotic therapy is highly effective at eliminating all $E$. coli.

B. While the current infection has been effectively treated, this patient may be at risk for a recurrent UTI.

C. The antibiotic therapy used for this patient was not sufficient to eliminate the infection.

44. Which piece of information would be the BEST support for the existence of the VBNC state?
A. the presence of DNA in the alleged VBNC cells
B. the presence of an intact plasma membrane in the alleged VBNC cells
C. the presence of specific proteins in the alleged VBNC cells
D. the detection of transcription in the alleged VBNC cells

45. Why would women be more likely to contract a UTI caused by E. coli as compared to men?
A. It is likely that the intestinal tracts of women contain a higher number of the E. coli bacteria as compared to men.
B. The urethra of a female is closer to the intestinal tract than in a male, making it easier for the $E$. coli bacteria from the intestinal tract to gain access to the urinary tract.
C. The E. coli bacteria in women are more likely to be resistant to antibiotic treatments.
D. The immune system is less efficient in women, making infection more likely to occur.

46. If the antibiotic treatment used in the graph was continued for a period of 30 days, the MOST likely prediction would be that the:

A. Colony-forming units per milliliter of E. coli cell counts would begin to increase.

B. Metabolically active cell counts would eventually decrease.

C. Colony-forming units per milliliter of $E$. coli cell counts would remain low and the count of metabolically active cells would gradually decrease.

D. Colony-forming units per milliliter of $E$. coli cells would remain low and the count of metabolically active cells would remain about the same.

47. The primary concern with the extended use of antibiotics to treat infections is that:

A. People become immune to the antibiotics so that when they really need them, the drugs will be useless.

B. The selective pressures of continued antibiotic use will induce resistance in the bacteria.

C. The antibiotics routinely cause toxicity in the body that can damage the liver and kidneys.

D. The antibiotics encourage the overgrowth of resident bacteria in the body.

48. One theory concerning VBNC cells is that they are simply on their way to dying. A piece of evidence that would refute that theory would be:

A. if some of the VBNC cells did die

B. if the VBNC cells resuscitated

C. if apoptosis was observed in the cells

D. if no metabolic activity was observed

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.

\section{Passage I}

Many alkenes can be hydrated simply by treatment with a strong acid in the presence of water. The limitation of this method is that a carbocation is generated along the mechanistic pathway, opening the door to rearrangements, as shown in the sulfuric acid-catalyzed hydration of 3,3-dimethylbut-1-ene here:

7. Blood is pumped from the heart at a rate of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ into the aorta of typical radius $1.2 \mathrm{~cm}$. The velocity of blood as it enters the aorta is MOST nearly:
A. $9 \frac{\mathrm{cm}}{\mathrm{s}}$

A. $0.1 \mathrm{C}$
B. $0.6 \mathrm{C}$
C. $1.0 \mathrm{C}$
D. $1.2 \mathrm{C}$ The reaction between sodium metal and chlorine gas is spontaneous and releases energy. The energy that is released is the enthalpy of formation of solid sodium chloride, which is also called the heat of formation. The reaction takes place in five elementary steps:

1. Sodium is vaporized.
$\mathrm{Na}(s) \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}(g)$
$\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{\mathrm{O}}=92 \mathrm{~kJ}$

2. Chlorine decomposes into atoms. $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Cl}(\mathrm{g})$ $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{\mathrm{o}}=121 \mathrm{~kJ}$

3. Gaseous sodium atoms ionize.

$\mathrm{Na}(g) \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}^{+}(g)+\mathrm{e}^{-}$ $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=496 \mathrm{~kJ}$

This quantity is the first ionization energy of sodium vapor.

4. The electron adds to a chlorine atom.

$\mathrm{Cl}(g)+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(g)$ $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-349 \mathrm{~kJ}$

This quantity is the electron affinity of chlorine.

5. The chloride ion reacts with the sodium ion.

$\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(g)+\mathrm{Na}^{+}(g) \rightarrow \mathrm{NaCl}(s) \quad \Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-771 \mathrm{~kJ}$

Addition of the five elementary equations gives the sum equation for the formation of solid sodium chloride. Most of the energy that is given off is due to the formation of solid sodium chloride from the gaseous ions. In solid sodium chloride, each positive ion is surrounded by 6 negative ions, and each negative ion is surrounded by 6 positive ions in a cubic lattice array. The lattice energy of an ionic compound is a measure of the attractive forces between the ions. The higher the lattice energy, the stronger the attractions and the higher melting the solid. Lattice energies depend on the charge and on the size of the ions in the array. If the size is constant, increasing charge increases the lattice energy. If the charge is constant, increasing size lowers the lattice energy.

Some lattice energies are given in the table.

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\hline Compound & Lattice Energy in kJ/mole \\
\hline $\mathrm{LiCl}$ & 834 \\
$\mathrm{KCl}$ & 701 \\

D. $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} 3 d^{1}$

11. Why is the lattice energy of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ so much greater than that of $\mathrm{NaCl}$ ?
A. Two sodium ions are needed for every sulfide.
B. Sulfide has a greater charge than chloride and is about the same size.

Questions 23-27 are based on the following passage.

Passage IV

An important class of oxidation-reduction reactions is called single displacement. In single displacement reactions, one element takes the place of another in a compound. The reactivity series for metals is a summary of the results of many single displacement experiments. A metal that is above another is more reactive and will take the place of the lower, less reactive metal in a compound.

For instance, a student places a sample of zinc metal into a solution of nickel (II) nitrate. The zinc reacts to displace the nickel ions as follows:

$\mathrm{Zn}(s)+\mathrm{Ni}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2}(a q) \rightarrow \mathrm{Ni}(s)+\mathrm{Zn}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2}(a q)$

The reactivity series also predicts the reactivity of a metal with water. Only a few metals-the Group I metals and calcium, strontium, and barium from Group IIreact with water at room temperature. This reaction is similar to a single displacement because the metal displaces the hydrogen in water. It is often called a hydrogen displacement reaction.

Dilute acid, usually hydrochloric acid, can be used to compare the reactivity of metals that do not react with water.

\section{Experiment}

A student reacts samples of copper, cobalt, and iron metal with dilute hydrochloric acid with the following results:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_d0387ee1dfec4e017221g-027.jpg?height=355&width=1033&top_left_y=801&top_left_x=424)

A general rule for the main group metals is that the reactivity of metals within a group increases going down the column, and the reactivity decreases going from left to right across a row. For transition metals, the reactivity does not change in a regular manner across a row but does decrease going down a column.

23. Which of the following BEST represents the reaction of calcium with water?

C. $\mathrm{Ca}(s)+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \rightarrow \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(s)+\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)$
D. $\mathrm{Ca}^{+2}(a q)+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \rightarrow \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)$

Questions 31-35 are based on the following passage.

Passage $\mathrm{V}$

The $\mathrm{S}_{N} 2$ reaction is applicable to a wide variety of substrates, and it is impacted by many parameters. First, a good leaving group is required for $\mathrm{S}_{N} 2$ to take place. Second, nucleophilic displacement is dependent upon a strong nucleophile; however, most potential nucleophiles exhibit both basic and nucleophilic character. As nucleophiles become more basic, the competing pathway of bimolecular elimination (E2) begins to predominate.

Questions 36-42 are based on the following passage.

Passage VI

Cervical traction devices employ forces transmitted through a system of pulleys to correct deformities of the neck and spine by maintaining their proper alignment. The physics involved in these devices are based on Newton's second law of motion and Atwood's machine.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_d0387ee1dfec4e017221g-030.jpg?height=626&width=1219&top_left_y=1525&top_left_x=564)

Newton's second law of motion states that a net force, $F_{\text {net, }}$, acting in a given direction on an object of mass, $m$, will result in an acceleration, $a$, of the object in that same direction, i.e.:

$$
\sum F=m a
$$

or

$$
\sum F_{x}=m a_{x} \text { and } \sum F_{y}=m a_{y}
$$

Atwood's machine, illustrated in the following figure, uses a block-and-pulley system to determine the acceleration of the system as well as other variables such as the falling distance of either mass and the tension in the string connecting the masses.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_d0387ee1dfec4e017221g-031.jpg?height=629&width=1236&top_left_y=938&top_left_x=325)

In a typical experimental setup, the Atwood machine is assembled with a massless string around a pulley. Connected on either end of the string are two masses, $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, where $m_{1} \neq m_{2}$. The pulley is considered to be massless as well as frictionless. When the connected masses are released, both masses will accelerate at the same rate with the larger mass accelerating downward and the smaller mass accelerating upward.

Students were asked to conduct experiments using Atwood's machine with a constant total mass of $300 \mathrm{~g}$. They were given hanging weights in increments of $10 \mathrm{~g}$ and could place any number of weights on either side of Atwood's machine as long as the total mass equaled $300 \mathrm{~g}$.

\section{Passage VII}

The Jones oxidation is a classical methodology for the oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones. The conditions involve the combination of potassium dichromate $\left(\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}\right)$, a shelf-stable crystalline solid, and aqueous sulfuric acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)$. This is simply a way to produce chromic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CrO}_{4}\right)$ in situ:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_d0387ee1dfec4e017221g-033.jpg?height=135&width=593&top_left_y=1686&top_left_x=647)

Under the reaction conditions, chromic acid produces equilibrium concentrations of chromium trioxide $\left(\mathrm{CrO}_{3}\right)$, which is the key oxidizing agent in the Jones oxidation: SECTION 2:

With primary alcohols, however, the reaction does not stop at the aldehyde stage. In the presence of acid and water, the initially formed carbonyl compounds are in equilibrium with their hydrates:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_d0387ee1dfec4e017221g-034.jpg?height=122&width=350&top_left_y=828&top_left_x=996)

The hydrates can form chromate esters with one of the hydroxyl groups, just as the alcohol substrates do. When $\mathrm{R}^{\prime}=\mathrm{H}$, this proton is easily lost to provide the carboxylic acid. Therefore, under Jones conditions, secondary alcohols yield ketones, but primary alcohols give carboxylic acids:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_d0387ee1dfec4e017221g-034.jpg?height=133&width=575&top_left_y=1186&top_left_x=886)

If aldehydes are desired from primary alcohols, the oxidation can be carried out with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), a shelf-stable crystalline solid that also provides chromium trioxide:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_d0387ee1dfec4e017221g-034.jpg?height=217&width=658&top_left_y=1510&top_left_x=842)

43. Ketones are NOT oxidized to carboxylic acids under Jones conditions because:

A. They do not form hydrates with water.

B. Their hydrates cannot form chromate esters.

C. The chromate esters of their hydrates cannot decompose by proton loss.

D. The chromate ester decomposition is reversible.

44. Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is selective for the production of aldehydes from primary alcohols because:

B. It does not introduce water into the reaction.

C. The pyridine prevents overoxidation.

D. The environment is less acidic. 

45. Consider the Jones oxidation of heptane-1,6-diol:

The MOST likely product of this reaction would be a(n):
A. hydroxy ketone
B. hydroxy acid
C. oxo aldehyde
D. oxo acid

47. A tertiary alcohol is treated with the Jones reagent, and the reaction mixture is worked up and purified. The MOST likely compound isolated is a(n):
A. alcohol
B. ketone

D. carboxylic acid

Questions 48-52 are based on the following passage.

Passage VIII

$\alpha$-D-glucose and $\beta$-D-glucose are interconverted through a process known as mutarotation, which proceeds via a ring-opened intermediate, as shown:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_d0387ee1dfec4e017221g-035.jpg?height=209&width=854&top_left_y=1809&top_left_x=516)

In solution, $\alpha$-D-glucose and $\beta$-D-glucose exist in a 9:16 ratio at equilibrium, but this is not what would be predicted from sterics alone. The discrepancy is largely due to the anomeric effect, which involves the interaction of the lone pairs on the ring oxygen with the C-1 hydroxy group.

D. orthoester

50. Aside from the multiple alcohols, the functional group found in the ring-opened intermediate is a(n):
A. ketone
B. aldehyde
C. acid
D. ester

51. $\alpha$-D-glucose and $\beta$-D-glucose are BEST described as:
A. hexoses and furanoses
B. pentoses and furanoses
C. hexoses and pyranoses
D. pentoses and pyranoses

52. The BEST rationale for the impact of the anomeric effect on the equilibrium of $\alpha$-D-glucose and $\beta$-D-glucose is:
A. It stabilizes $\alpha$-D-glucose and destabilizes $\beta$-D-glucose.
B. It destabilizes $\alpha$-D-glucose and stabilizes $\beta$-D-glucose.
C. It stabilizes both $\alpha$-D-glucose and $\beta$-D-glucose.
D. It destabilizes both $\alpha$-D-glucose and $\beta$-D-glucose.

In the general chemistry laboratory, it is convenient to carry out most reactions in solution, usually aqueous solution. When solid ionic compounds are mixed together at room temperature, no reaction takes place. But if aqueous solutions of the solids are mixed, a reaction can take place. Common types of reactions in aqueous solution include acid-base reactions, precipitation reactions, and oxidation-reduction reactions. Compounds have different solubilities in water, as shown in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{lcc}

Ions in water solution are called electrolytes, and a solution of electrolytes will conduct electricity. The ability to conduct electricity is called conductivity, and it is directly related to the concentration of ions in solution. Ionic compounds that are very soluble in water are strong electrolytes. Ionic compounds that are sparingly soluble in water are weak electrolytes. Covalent compounds can be strong, weak, or even nonelectrolytes. It depends on whether the substance can form ions in solution, and if so, the concentration of the ions.

A general rule for predicting whether a reaction will take place when two electrolytic solutions are mixed is that a reaction will take place if one or both possible products are either insoluble, weak, or nonelectrolyte.

Experiment

A student determines if each of a series of compounds was soluble or insoluble in water. The results are as follows.

\begin{tabular}{lc}
\hline Compound & Soluble in Water \\
\hline $\mathrm{NaCl}$ & yes \\
$\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}$ & yes \\
$\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ & yes \\

Passage I

Described by the psychologist B. F. Skinner, operant conditioning posits that learning can be understood by the interaction between reinforcers and stimuli. Studies from both comparative and human psychology have supported Skinner's initial findings and expanded upon them.

The following figure shows a hypothetical example of various operant conditioning trials. During these trials, when a rat pressed a bar (as indicated by the hash mark on the graph), the behavior was reinforced by the presentation of a food pellet. The reinforcement schedule differs in each cell of the figure. Time is displayed on the $x$-axis and cumulative responses (bar presses) is displayed on the $y$-axis.

of Behavior In psychology, research examining moral development has typically focused on agerelated differences. One such approach is Lawrence Kohlberg's theory that individuals progress through three levels of morality: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional. Kohlberg identified these levels based on participants' reactions to stories that present moral dilemmas. For example, participants were asked to respond to a story in which a poor man named Heinz steals a drug for his wife who would die without the drug.

The following figure depicts the moral reasoning levels that Kohlberg found within each age group on his scale. In each graph, the proportion of responders tested who showed the indicated level of moral reasoning is shown on the $y$-axis and the age of the responders is shown on the $x$-axis.

Passage III

Researchers studying vision use various methods to investigate human perceptual experience. Research on spectral sensitivity of the rod receptors (scattered throughout the retina) and cone visual receptors (mainly concentrated in the fovea area of the retina) highlights the relationship between perception and physiology.

Signal detection methods have been used to measure the differences in how perception adjusts to low-light environments. Participant responses can be plotted based on sensitivity versus length of time in the dark. The dark adaptation curve can be plotted showing how rods and cones differ in their sensitivity to light over time.

Three dark adaptation curves. Both dashed lines indicate receptor-specific curves, while the solid line is a plot of human light sensitivity with both receptor types included.

15. The dark adaptation curve can be plotted by asking participants to fixate on a specific point and then using signal detection methods with a test light. What is the MOST likely way that researchers would be able to isolate the responses of each receptor type, based on the physiology of the eye?

A. by using colored versus white lights to differentially activate the rods and cones

B. by changing the location of the test light from the focal point to the periphery

C. by asking participants to cover one eye while performing the comparison tasks

D. by alternating the brightness using flashing lights in order to preferentially activate one receptor type rather than the other

16. Signal detection methods are used to plot the dark adaptation curve. Based on these methods, what would be the threshold used for correctly detecting the presence of the test light?

A. A participant is considered to have detected the light if he or she can identify the comparison light presence $50 \%$ of the time.

B. A participant is considered to have detected the light if he or she can identify the comparison light presence $25 \%$ of the time.

C. A participant is considered to have detected the light if he or she can identify the comparison light presence $75 \%$ of the time.

18. Which of the following statements is true?
A. Rods are responsible for color vision, which explains color sensitivity under low-light conditions.
B. Cones are responsible for color vision, which explains greater color sensitivity under low-light conditions.
C. Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.
D. Both rods and cones respond to specific colors in the light spectrum; loss of color vision in dark conditions is the result of fewer photons of light.

19. Based on the research described above and the physiology of the eye, what is the MOST likely explanation for increased rod sensitivity after the rod-cone break?
A. Cones are poorer at light adaptation because large groups of them are con- nected to one interneuron.
B. Cones are better at light adaptation because they respond to specific wave- lengths of light.
C. Rods are poorer at light adaptation because they are less prone to pigment bleaching.
D. Rods are better at light adaptation because large groups of them are connected to one interneuron.

Questions 50-54 are based on the following passage.

Passage $\mathbf{X}$

High levels of sustained stress have been studied by a number of researchers. Psychological stress can create escalations in the HPA axis that shift the body out of homeostasis.

An important theory describing the psychophysiological effects of stress was developed by the Austrian-Canadian endocrinologist Hans Selye. This theory posits a general adaptation syndrome (GAS) characterized by three stages: alarm reaction, resistance, and exhaustion.

Selye's model is shown in the following figure. The three phases are shown in order from left to right with stress plotted on the $y$-axis from low to high.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_d0387ee1dfec4e017221g-059.jpg?height=634&width=1209&top_left_y=987&top_left_x=339)

A person who is going through a divorce constantly complains about feeling tired, avoids family members who disapprove of the divorce, spends time with supportive friends, and engages in meditation in an effort to control feelings of irritation and anger. Which phase of GAS is the person MOST likely in, and how long might this condition last?

A. Shock; the reaction will only last for a few days.

B. Countershock; the reaction can persist for hours, days, or years.

C. Exhaustion; the reaction will last for only a few days.

D. Resistance; the reaction can persist for hours, days, or years.

52. Which of the following statements is true based on GAS theory?

A. Resistance reactions are not adaptive and should be avoided.

B. Resistance reactions are activities to reduce the impact of stress and avoid exhaustion.

C. Physiological exhaustion is a necessary stage for any stress response.

D. Physiological exhaustion results in increased stress.

53. An interpretation of the GAS theory posits that stressful life events occurring in combination can damage physical health. Extrapolating from the graph and integrating your knowledge of stress physiology, how would multiple simultaneous stressful events affect an individual?

A. Multiple stressors would allow a person to repeatedly restart the process in the alarm stage, which would help that person improve resistance to stress and avoid exhaustion.

B. Multiple simultaneous stressors may overwhelm an individual's stress resistance activities and push him or her into the exhaustion stage more quickly.

C. It would not matter because individuals rarely encounter multiple stressors simultaneously.

D. Stressful life events are difficult to classify or study, so we cannot begin to guess how multiple stressors would affect people.

\section{Passage XI}

Researchers have long studied human memory. In a classic series of studies, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus investigated the storage and recall of information in memory. Based on his findings, he developed the so-called forgetting curve, a way of illustrating the rate at which people forget the information they have learned. The forgetting curve has been studied in a variety of different environments and for a variety of different stimuli.

On day 1 of a memory research study, participants were asked to learn a list of items. Researchers then tracked the proportion of the list that the participants remembered as time passed. On day 2 , some participants were asked to relearn the list. Again, the proportion remembered was tracked over time. On day 3 , some participants were asked to relearn the list a second time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time. On day 4, some participants were asked to relearn the list a third time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time.

The data from this study produced the following set of forgetting curves. Each line represents the memory of the learned or relearned list. The proportion of the list remembered is shown on the $y$-axis (memory), and the time interval for forgetting is shown on the $x$-axis (time remembered in days).

Forgetting curves. Each curve represents the memory of a learned or relearned list.

55. Based on the graph, which of the following statements BEST characterizes forgetting?
A. Most forgetting occurs gradually over a long period of time.
B. Most forgetting occurs after only a few days.

If you retake the test every summer for the next few years, based on the graph, how would you expect to perform on the test?
A. Test performance would decline sharply at first but decline less and less in later years.
B. Test performance would decline gradually over the years and then stabilize.
C. Test performance would decline sharply at first and continue to decline rapidly until eventually you were unable to remember anything at all.
D. Test performance would decline only slightly from year to year until eventually you were unable to remember anything at all.

59. Suppose that you have been asked to remember a series of passwords for online sites. You are not permitted to write them down but can study a list of the passwords once a week for several months. Each week you are asked to enter the passwords with no errors prior to studying the list. Based on the graph, how would you expect to perform each week?

A. There would be a sharp decline in your memory each week regardless of the number of times you studied the list.

B. There would be a gradual decline in your memory each week until the number of remembered passwords stabilized.

C. There would be a gradual decline in your memory each week regardless of the number of times you studied the list.

D. There would be a significant decline in your memory in the first week, but the decline would become less abrupt each week after you studied the list.

STOP. This is the end of Section 3. 

\section{Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills}

Directions: This section includes eight reading passages. Each passage is followed by a group of questions. Read each passage, and then select the one best answer to each question based on what you have read.

Questions 1-6 are based on the following passage.

Passage I

According to Professor John MacKinnon, certain places are more likely than others to house new or rediscovered species. First, scientists should look in areas that are geologically stable. Areas with regular earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are less likely to contain species that go back thousands of years because, obviously, the frequent upheavals are not conducive to steady growth or a comfortable way of life. Second, scientists are most likely to find undiscovered or rediscovered species in remote, isolated areas. Cultivated areas are inhospitable to many animals. Often, cultivation eliminates the trees or shrubs that house and protect animal life. A stable climate is a third thing to look for. Stability of climate ensures that the animals that live in the region have had no reason to leave for warmer or wetter environments.

Although most of the recent discoveries and rediscoveries of animal species have taken place in tropical, humid regions, some have occurred in rarely explored mountain habitats. A fourth key thing scientists should look for, according to MacKinnon, is an area with a variety of unusual species that are specific to that area. Of course, this requirement refers back to requirement number two, isolation. An area that is very isolated or difficult to access will naturally have species that cannot be found anywhere else.

In 1994 American biologist Peter Zahler took his second trip to the isolated valleys of the Diamer region in northern Pakistan. He was searching for the woolly flying squirrel, a dog-sized squirrel last seen in 1924. As he describes it, he had narrowed down his search to two animals, using the criteria mammal, not too small, relatively unknown, and in need of conservation intervention. Because he did not wish to spend time in the steamy environment of the Congo basin, he eliminated the aquatic genet 
the squirrel. Many recalled hearing tales about the strange animal, but all insisted it was extinct.

Zahler continued to set traps, listen to squirrel legends, and ask questions. He dodged avalanches, skirted valleys patrolled by armed warlords, and crossed mountains on narrow goat paths. Policemen told him that the squirrels indeed existed in caves above the valley, and that they excreted a substance, salajit, that was used as an aphrodisiac. One day, two large, machine gun-toting men entered his camp. After some small talk, one asked whether he would be willing to pay for a live squirrel. The pair claimed to be salajit collectors. Zahler agreed to pay top dollar, never envisioning that 2 hours later, he would be presented with a woolly flying squirrel in a bag. Following that surprise, Zahler located evidence of live squirrels throughout the region. The squirrel certainly obeyed all of MacKinnon's regulations. Despite frequent avalanches, the Himalayas are a geologically stable area with a harsh but stable climate and a number of rare species. Not only were the squirrels' caves remote and isolated, it was often necessary to rappel down or climb up sheer cliffs to reach them.

Each rediscovery gives scientists a vital second chance to protect and preserve our rarest, most fragile species. With scientists and students from Pakistan, Zahler began work on a program to protect the squirrel's habitat. Only the advent of war in Afghanistan forced him to abandon the area, and he remains connected to scientists in Pakistan who are continuing the effort.

\section{Passage II}

Beaten down, the world against them, exhausted-such was the self-assessment of the Beat Generation, as defined by Jack Kerouac in a 1948 conversation that became part of a 1952 New York Times article. At that time, the Beats were in their infancy. In the early '40s, Kerouac attended Columbia University on a football scholarship, but a leg injury ended his football career and forced him to drop out of school. His brief sojourn with the Merchant Marine and the Navy ended badly, and Kerouac limped back to New York to rejoin friends at Columbia, where he met student Allen Ginsberg and the older William S. Burroughs. Most of Kerouac's friends had come of age during World War II, just as Ernest Hemingway and his friends had done during World War I. Just as Hemingway's generation was "Lost," the new generation was "Beat." They found SECTION 4:

Critical

Analysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT

Practice Test 1 it impossible to find a place in the new, postwar economy. They lived in toxic, brutal poverty and moved constantly, and many of them struggled to find publishers for their oddly constructed, turbulent writings.

Kerouac would be the first of his friends to find a publisher, for his first novel, the rather pedestrian the Town and the City published in 1950. The following year, he traveled cross-country with his friend Neal Cassady, a trip that would inspire his most famous work, On the Road. Perhaps as much as any Beat work, this frenetic work illustrated the Beat dislike of conformity and desire for movement and new experiences.

Kerouac would continue to write prolifically in the 7 years it took to get On the Road published. Meanwhile, Burroughs published Junkie, an autobiographical tome on addiction, and Ginsberg published his seminal work, the stream-of-consciousness poem "Howl." "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness ..." cried the poet, summing up again the powerlessness of the Beat Generation. Ginsberg used street vernacular and rhythms inspired by the jazz scene of the '50s.

The Beat scene was peripatetic, moving from New York to San Francisco (where "Howl" was published) and later to the left bank in Paris, where Hemingway's Lost scene had emigrated many years earlier. Ginsberg left San Francisco for Paris when his poem "Howl" became the subject of an obscenity trial for its use of colloquial speech and its openness about drugs and homosexuality. He traveled from Paris to Tangier, where Burroughs was living, and helped Burroughs assemble the manuscript of his most famous and infamous work, Naked Lunch. Burroughs's book would be published in Paris in 1959 and then in the United States in 1962; again, it would be the center of a long obscenity trial. Both "Howl" and Naked Lunch emerged from their trials unscathed; the obscenity charges were determined to be unfounded, and the trials loosened some of the definitions that had bound American literature. In addition, of course, the publicity put the Beats on the front pages of newspapers nationwide.

The Beats were of their time, and they transcended their time. The highway system that crisscrossed the United States in the 1950s gave them the power to move. Suburbia and the man in the gray flannel suit gave them something to despise. The cold war gave them angst and disillusionment. Jazz and the drug culture gave them a way out. Without the Beats to pave the way, sixties culture would have looked quite different, and the gay liberation movement of the 1970s might never have come to pass.

7. The author compares the Beat Generation to the Lost Generation in terms of their:
A. poverty
B. openness
C. prolific output
D. alienation

8. In the context of the passage, the word culture is used primarily to mean:
A. nation

Questions 13-18 are based on the following passage.

Passage III

Aluminum is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust, but it is never found naturally as an element. Instead, it always appears naturally in its oxidized form as a hydroxide we call bauxite.

Bauxite occurs in three main forms. The forms vary in the number of molecules of water it takes for hydration and in the crystalline structure of the molecule. Gibbsite is a trihydrate form $\left[\operatorname{AI}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}\right]$. Bohmite and diaspore are monohydrates $[\mathrm{AIO}(\mathrm{OH})]$. Of the three, the main form that is mined is gibbsite. Bauxite may be hard or soft, and it comes in a variety of colors that range from white to red.

Bauxite is formed due to the weathering of alumina-bearing rocks. It often appears as an extensive blanket of ore and is usually mined using surface-mining techniques. By far the largest consumers of aluminum are the United States, Japan, and Germany, but except for a little in Texas and Arkansas, bauxite is nearly nonexistent there. The major producers of bauxite are Australia, which produces around 40 percent of the SECTION 4:

Practice Test 1 world's supply, and Guinea, in West Africa. The United States gets much of its supply from Brazil and Jamaica.

The extraction of aluminum from bauxite requires three stages. First, the ore is mined. Then it is refined to recover alumina. Finally, the alumina is smelted to produce aluminum.

The mining is done via the open-cut method. Bulldozers remove the topsoil, and excavators or other types of power machinery are used to remove the underlying layer of bauxite. The bauxite may be washed to remove clay and other detritus.

Refining is done via the Bayer refining process, named after its inventor, Karl Bayer. Ground bauxite is fed into a digester, where it is mixed with a caustic soda. The aluminum oxide reacts with the soda to form a solution of sodium aluminate and a precipitate of sodium aluminum silicate. The solution is separated from the silicate through washing and pumping, and the alumina is precipitated from the solution, where it appears as crystals of alumina hydrate. The crystals are washed again to remove any remaining solution. Then they are heated to remove water, leaving the gritty alumina.

Smelting is done via the Hall-Heroult smelting process. An electric current is passed through a molten solution of alumina and cryolite, which is in a cell lined at the bottom and top with carbon. This forces the oxygen to combine with the carbon at the top of the cell, making carbon dioxide, while the molten metallic aluminum collects at the bottom of the cell, where it is siphoned off, cleaned up, and cast into bars, sheets, or whatever form is needed.

As with all mining of metals, bauxite mining presents certain hazards. Along with the usual mining issues of degraded soil and polluted runoff, chief among them is the omnipresent bauxite dust, which clogs machinery and lungs, sometimes for miles around the mining site. Jamaica and Brazil have seen widespread protests recently against the major bauxite mining companies, which continue to insist that no link between bauxite dust and pervasive lung problems has been proved.

13. In the context of the passage, the word refined means:
A. superior
B. polished
C. processed
D. restricted

14. The discussion of protests shows primarily that:
A. Bauxite mining takes place in the Third World.
B. Workers are starting to fight back against the dangers of mining.

D. The government of Brazil works with the mining companies.

15. The passage suggests that the author would MOST likely believe that:
A. Bauxite mining poses health problems.
B. The United States should use less aluminum.
C. Australian bauxite is the best quality.
D. Karl Bayer was something of a genius. 

16. All of these are produced by the Bayer process EXCEPT:

A. the building of steel bridges
B. the making of copper tubing
C. the manufacturing of glass
D. the mixing of cement

Questions 19-25 are based on the following passage.

Passage IV

"I acknowledge Shakespeare to be the world's greatest dramatic poet, but regret that no parent could place the uncorrected book in the hands of his daughter, and therefore I have prepared the Family Shakespeare."

Thus did Thomas Bowdler, a self-appointed editor trained as a physician, explain his creation of a children's edition of Shakespeare that omitted some characters completely, toned down language he considered objectionable, and euphemized such shocking situations as Ophelia's suicide-an accident in Bowdler's version.

Bowdler was hardly the first to tone down the Bard. Poet laureate Nahum Tate rewrote King Lear, banishing the Fool entirely and giving the play a happy ending. His version was staged regularly from the 1680 s through the 18 th century.

Thomas Bowdler was, from all the evidence, a less likely editor. He was born in 1754 near Bath, England, to a wealthy family. He studied medicine but never really practiced, preferring to exercise philanthropy and to play chess, at which he was a master. In his retirement, he decided to try his hand at editorial work. Shakespeare's dramas were his first project. He added nothing to the texts, but by cutting and paraphrasing strove to remove anything that "could give just offense to the religious and virtuous mind."

The result was a 10-volume expurgated version that was criticized widely, although hardly universally. The famed British poet Algernon Swinburne remarked that "no man ever did better service to Shakespeare than the man who made it possible to put him into the hands of intelligent and imaginative children."

There is some indication that Bowdler's sister Harriet did the actual editing of Shakespeare's text. She was a poet and editor in her own right, and clearly more qualified than her brother to lay hands on the Bard of Avon. She may have published the expurgated edition anonymously before allowing her brother to take over the rights. If SECTION 4:

Critical

Analysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT

Practice Test 1 this is so, it is unsurprising that Harriet would not have wanted her name on the book. If the original Shakespeare were truly objectionable, then it would have been doubly so for a well-bred, unmarried Englishwoman of the day.

Bowdler went on to create children's versions of the Old Testament and of Edward Gibbons's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, although neither achieved either the success or ridicule of his Shakespeare. Today, of course, we know Bowdler not for his good works, but instead for the eponym derived from his good name. To bowdlerize is to censor or amend a written work, often with a connotation of prudishness. The process for which Bowdler is known is one that continues to the present day, as texts deemed too difficult for today's high schoolers are "dumbed-down," library editions of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn have the "n-word" blacked out, and middle-school productions of popular Broadway plays have all expletives deleted. We would be hard-pressed to say that we live in a prudish era, but some of the same impulses that drove Thomas and Harriet Bowdler still exist today.

19. The main argument of the final paragraph is that:
A. Bowdler did a disservice to the readers of his works.
B. Bowdler's edited texts have long since vanished into history.
C. We continue to bowdlerize texts to the present day.
D. Today we look at Bowdler as a negative influence on writing.

20. The passage implies that Bowdler's sister was a more likely editor than he because:
A. She would have been truly offended by Shakespeare's plots.
B. Unlike her brother, she was a published writer and editor.
C. Bowdler was known for his misuse of the English language.
D. Women of the time were more likely to read Shakespeare.

21. The passage suggests that Bowdler was influenced by:
A. prudery
B. erudition
C. a poet laureate
D. a dream

22. The mention of Nahum Tate shows primarily that:
A. Few dared to change Shakespeare's works during his lifetime.
B. Actors and directors often changed Shakespeare's words to suit their talents.
C. Different versions of King Lear were used depending on the audience.
D. The Bowdlers were not the first to alter Shakespeare's texts.

23. Based on the information in this passage, which of these would NOT be bowdlerization?

I. translating a Japanese folktale into English

II. eliminating references to witches from a fairy tale

III. burning copies of The Satanic Verses
A. I only
B. II only
C. I and III only
D. II and III only 

24. The author's claim that Bowdler's Shakespeare was not unanimously criticized is supported by:
A. a quotation from Algernon Swinburne
B. reference to later children's works by Bowdler
C. the definition of the eponym formed from his name
D. the example of Ophelia's revised "suicide"

25. Given the information in the passage, if a bowdlerized version of Shakespeare were available to parents today, which of the following outcomes would MOST likely occur?
A. Some would ridicule it, and others would buy it.
B. No one would take it or its author seriously.
C. Most students would find it too difficult to read.
D. It would be a dismal failure and be taken off the market.

Questions 26-33 are based on the following passage.

\section{Passage $\mathrm{V}$}

The Nobel Peace Prize has often engendered controversy. The Red Cross, yes, but Henry Kissinger? Mother Teresa, perhaps, but Yasser Arafat? Surprisingly, a loud and ongoing controversy surrounds a choice that at first look seems most benign-that of the Guatemalan freedom fighter, Rigoberta Menchú Tum.

Rigoberta Menchú was born in 1959 to a poor Mayan family in Guatemala. At the time of her birth, General Ydígoras Fuentes had just seized power, following the assassination of Colonel Castillo Armas. The year she turned one, there was a failed coup by a military group, many of whom fled to the countryside and would return to lead the rebellion that would wax and wane for the next 36 years.

Guatemala was divided into factions for that entire period, as military governments controlled the nation and guerilla groups controlled the countryside. At the same time, right-wing vigilantes led a campaign of torture and assassination, eliminating students and peasants they deemed to be allied with the guerillas.

In the countryside where Rigoberta lived, the battles were largely over control of farmland. Rigoberta's father was taken into custody and tortured when the army believed he had assisted in the assassination of a plantation owner. Following a rout of the guerillas by the army, the guerillas regrouped and began to take their fight to the capital, beginning a long series of assassinations of government figures.

Rigoberta, her father, and some of her siblings joined the Committee of the Peasant Union (CUC). In rapid succession, Rigoberta lost her brother, father, and mother to the army's own assassination squads. Rigoberta, though only in her early 20s, became a key figure in the resistance, traveling from village to village to educate the Mayan peasants in overcoming oppression, and leading demonstrations in Guatemala City.

Soon Rigoberta was herself a target. She fled to Mexico and continued her life as an organizer, concentrating her focus on peasants' rights. She participated in the founding of the United Representation of the Guatemalan Opposition (RUOG). This period was the most violent of the entire Guatemalan civil war. Under the new president, General Efrain Ríos Montt, massacres of civilians became an everyday occurrence. SECTION 4:

Critical

Analysis and Reasoning Skills The controversy is all about the book. It began when anthropologist David Stoll began independent research on the same era about which Rigoberta dictated and discovered discrepancies in her recall of events. Massacres she described were not remembered by the locals; one of her brothers died by shooting rather than by fire, dates were incorrect, and so on. Stoll's discoveries were enough to roil up conservative historians and columnists, who declared Rigoberta's book the grossest propaganda and her career, therefore, unworthy of the Nobel Prize. Not surprisingly, this brought forth charges of racism, sexism, and cultural ignorance from the other side.

The Nobel Committee maintained a stiff upper lip throughout the political backand-forth and still insists that Rigoberta's prize had to do with her documented good works and not with her personal recorded history. Rigoberta's book is still widely taught, and her place in the history of Central American peasant revolutions seems assured.

\section{Passage VI}

If our knowledge of the world occurs through the weaving of narratives, as postmodernists would have us believe, then we must judge the truth of each narrative by comparing it with what we value and what we already accept as true. Any metanarrative, or overarching "big story," must be rejected because it attempts to explain away too many individual narratives. 
history through that metanarrative, postmodernists would argue, does not allow us to consider the contributions of other groups to the country we live in today. So constructing a metanarrative can often be exclusionary.

Of course, constructing a series of smaller narratives is just as exclusionary because it frames experience in a limited way. It is easy to see this occurring if you look at any university course list today. How is it possible for American History 4111, "Imperialism and Amerindians, 1600-1840" to coexist alongside American History 4546, "American Military History and Policy"? Does English 340X, "Survey of Women's Literature," subsume or incorporate elements of English 342X, "American Indian Women Writers"? Perhaps we should pity the undergraduate student today. Lacking any overarching metanarrative to provide perspective, how can the poor student wade through the often contradictory mininarratives being thrown his or her way?

There is no question that the old way was wrongheaded and elitist. Survey courses that emphasized the white male perspective were removed from the curriculum in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, and for good reason. But replacing them with a smorgasbord of mininarratives risks eliminating any sense of a big picture. Can students connect the dots to define a coherent reality, or must their reality be a series of frames with no links among them?

Revising the canon was about ridding our perspective of those racist, sexist, or classist notions that insisted on a single Truth with a capital $T$. Of course there is no overriding Truth that applies to everyone. For everyone who believes that Thomas Jefferson was a brilliant reformer, there is someone who thinks he was a two-faced slaveholder. Yet, where does it leave us if everyone we know is approaching history, science, literature, or what have you from a slightly different angle? It's bad enough when partisan politics divides us into red states and blue states. How much worse is it to imagine ourselves clad in thousands upon thousands of shades of purple?

The clearest sign that we are not ready to abandon our metanarratives comes in the current and ongoing clash between those who accept evolutionary theory and those who accept the Bible as the written word of God. The latter grant the Earth 6000 years of life, the former give it several million more, and never the twain shall meet. Each of these viewpoints is a metanarrative, a big story that governs people's understanding of the world. Like many metanarratives, each of these completely negates the other.

So on the one hand, metanarratives don't work well because they are too exclusionary. And on the other hand, mininarratives don't work well because they are too narrow. It will be fascinating to watch the canon evolve over the next few decades and to see whether this dichotomy can ever be resolved. 34. The main argument of the passage is that:
A. Metanarratives provide the best way to view the world.
B. Metanarratives are usually more restrictive than mininarratives.
C. Mininarratives are racist, sexist, and classist.
D. Neither metanarratives nor mininarratives offer a flawless perspective.

35. The passage suggests that the author would MOST likely believe that:
A. Colleges should offer more courses in American history.
B. Revising the canon in the late 20th century was a bad idea.
C. Students today need a more global perspective than their coursework provides.
D. Divisiveness in politics is preferable to conformity or unilateralism.

Passage VII

What began as an online personal diary of sorts about a decade ago has become a multimillion-dollar-a-year business that is reshaping the nature of the media, publishing, and marketing. It has the power to catapult unknowns into celebrities, affect political careers, and even influence language. They were known first as "web logs," which evolved into "weblogs" and finally "blogs." In 2004, Merriam-Webster declared blog its Word of the Year.

It is estimated that more than 50 million people are blogging, and every second two new blogs are created. Most bloggers use the tool for its original purpose: periodically posting their thoughts on subjects of their choosing for others to read and comment on. But what sounds on the surface to be merely a public display of ideas is in effect changing the nature of media. Print newspapers and magazines have a staff of writers, researchers, and editors who find what they deem to be appropriate (often defined as "nonoffense") material, shape it, and present it to an audience of passive consumers. When those passive consumers use simple websites to disseminate facts and ideas of their choosing, they evolve from passive consumers to active participants, effectively blurring the line between the media and its audience.

Many bloggers choose to focus on news stories that receive little attention from traditional media outlets. They research, report, and comment on information that the public might otherwise not have easy access to. Traditional media companies have stockholders to answer to, and sometimes edit content to eliminate or reduce possible controversial material. Blogs, in comparison, thrive on controversy. Indeed, that is where they most often make their mark. Talking Points Memo, which debuted in 2000, is a left-wing political site whose staff has grown to include eight employees, including five research interns. In December 2002, the blog focused on Senator Trent Lott's comments at a political function that many deemed bigoted, a story that was virtually ignored by print, radio, and television media sources. In less than two weeks, the public outcry grew, and Lott resigned from his post as Senate majority leader.

In addition to their influence, popular bloggers are able to turn their sleuthing and private rants into dollars. Marketers looking for new and more effective ways to reach consumers are increasingly spending money on online advertising. By 2005 , it was estimated that $\$ 100$ million dollars' worth of blogs ads were sold. One blogger in Kentucky uses his site, fark.com, to spread his brand of humor and is earning millions of dollars in ad revenue this year, thanks to the support of theme parks, shampoos, and nutrition bars. But this is predicted to be just the tip of the blogs profitability iceberg. Overall web advertising is expected to grow by 50 percent to $\$ 23.6$ billion in 2010 ; much of that will make its way on to blogs.

41. The central thesis of the passage is that:
A. Blogging was once a solitary activity, but popular blogs now have readerships in the millions.
B. Advertisers are spending more money on blogs and less on traditional print and broadcasting outlets.
C. Blogs are not only becoming profitable, but they are also influencing the media and the business of publishing and advertising.
D. Some bloggers have become millionaires as their popular websites are replete with advertising.

42. The passage implies that bloggers who want to receive, or increase current levels of, advertising revenue must:
A. strive to be more controversial
B. build their readership
C. include more content concerning celebrities and politicians
D. appeal directly to marketers

43. Suppose evidence was presented to show that traditional media sources were becoming successful in their attempts to compete for blogs' advertising revenue. This new information would MOST challenge the implication that:
A. Advertisers are spending money on blogs because they present a more effective way to reach consumers.
B. People choose to read blogs because they don't have to appeal to stockholders.
C. Popular blogs are better at disseminating information than traditional media sources.
D. Active participants blur the line between the media and its audience.

Passage VIII

It is perhaps too easy to think of mathematical truths as objective entities existing in the universe, simply waiting to be "discovered" by brilliant minds such as Pythagoras, Newton, and Descartes. Indeed, such a mentality may be cemented in Western minds raised in the Platonic tradition of a world of ideals that exists outside of the material world we reside in.

But new research in the fields of cognitive science and developmental psychology may be challenging this long-held belief in mathematics as a truth outside of human experience, and recasting mathematics as a product of the brain, an entity that is not discovered by man but rather created by him.

Such a radical paradigm shift has predictably met with stiff resistance, but the evidence in favor of a created mathematics rather than a discovered mathematics is compelling. Study after study has shown that all people possess an innate arithmetic. Babies as young as three or four days old can differentiate between groups of two and three items. And by the age of four months or so, an infant can see that one plus one is two and two minus one is one. Researchers discovered this startling fact by means of a simple experiment, following what is known as the violation of expectation model in developmental psychology. An infant was presented with a scenario in which a researcher held a puppet before the baby's eyes. Then a screen was moved in front of the puppet and another researcher placed a second puppet behind it. The screen was removed and if there were two puppets now visible, the infant registered no surprise (as measured by both the direction of the child's gaze and the duration of her stare). But if the screen was removed and only one puppet appeared, the infant registered perplexity at the situation. This experiment and others like it strongly suggest that all individuals are born with certain mathematical concepts hardwired into their brains. The ability to quickly and accurately count a small number of items, called subitizing by psychologists, is also found in animals. Researchers using experiments similar to the violation of expectation setup described previously have found an innate mathematical ability not just in primates, our closest evolutionary cousins, but in raccoons, rats, parrots, and pigeons. These findings are consistent with the belief that mathematical thinking is a function of the structures in the brain and not a product of the outside world.

Anomalous cases involving brain injuries and disorders also support the idea that mathematical thinking arises from the organization of the brain. There is a documented case of a subject with a $\mathrm{PhD}$ in chemistry who suffers from acalculia, the inability to perform basic arithmetic functions. Strangely, this patient is unable to perform simple calculations such as five plus three or eight minus two, but has no problem manipulating abstract algebraic operations. This curious fact has led psychologists to conclude that the part of the brain that handles abstract algebraic operations must be different from the part of the brain that works with more concrete arithmetic functions.

47. The author probably mentions the "Platonic tradition" in order to:
A. explain why some people may be less accepting of certain conclusions
B. demonstrate the philosophical and historical underpinnings of mathematical studies
C. highlight another influential Western figure in mathematical thought

\section{ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS}

\section{Section 1. Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems}

1. The correct answer is B. The passage explains that in acute cases of leukemia, Passage I immature leukocytes are involved. This implies that these immature cells are abnormal and may not proliferate into normal mature leukocytes. The passage also indicates that in chronic cases of leukemia, mature leukocytes are affected so that it is possible that some unaffected immature cells may proliferate into functional mature cells. If there are some functional leukocytes, the person would be likely to survive longer without treatment.

2. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The blood-brain barrier is a change in the permeability of blood vessels leading to the brain. Depending on the chemical composition, some drugs can cross and some cannot. Of the choices listed, it seems that if the drugs cannot reach the brain, then they have not crossed the blood-brain barrier. While choice D might seem plausible if a drug was ingested, it would not make sense for a drug that was injected.

3. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Of the items listed in the question, the thing they all have in common is that they are mutagens or involve some genetic change. These mutations to the DNA can lead to the production of altered proteins that can be associated with cancer. While some cancers are associated with changes in cellular growth factors, this would not be the case for all cancers. The translation of proteins is directly from the mRNA, which is derived from the DNA in transcription. There would have to be a change in the DNA for the translation of proteins to be affected.

4. The correct answer is C. This question is simply asking about the function of antibiotics. Since a person with leukemia has abnormal leukocytes, there can be problems with the functioning of the immune system such that it does not fight infection well. Antibiotics kill bacteria cells, not viruses, and could help prevent bacterial infections in the leukemia patient who has a compromised immune system.

5. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. Some of the choices listed here relate to processes that are not unique to the cell cycle, which regulates cell division. Since cancer involves abnormal cell division, there is a problem with cell-cycle regulation. For example, protein synthesis is not a cell-cycle specific process. Purine analogs can be incorporated during DNA and RNA synthesis, which is also not cell-cycle specific. Alkylating agents interfere with DNA functioning, which is also not specific to MCAT

Practice Test 1 the cell cycle. However, tubulin-binding agents interfere with microtubules, which are used to form spindle fibers during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. If the spindle fibers are disrupted, chromosome alignment cannot happen properly and cell division will be halted.

6. The correct answer is A. Stem cells that originate in the bone marrow serve as the precursor to all blood cells. These include the erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. If a person has leukemia and abnormal leukocytes, a stem cell transplant would allow for the differentiation of new and hopefully normal leukocytes. Stem cells do not have the ability to directly attack other cells, replace the function of abnormal cells, or act as immune system modulators.

Passage II 7. The correct answer is C. Solutions that are hypotonic contain less solute and more water than what they are being compared to. In this case, the excess water in the extracellular fluid makes it hypotonic to the cells. This causes water to move into the cells by osmosis. Isotonic solutions have equal solute concentrations both inside and outside the cell. Hypertonic solutions have more solute and less water relative to what they are being compared to. In this case, the intracellular fluid would be hypertonic.

8. The correct answer is A. Sodium has a variety of roles in the body. Of the choices listed, sodium is highly involved with the function of neurons. The sodium/ potassium pumps maintain an unequal balance of ions across the membrane of neurons during resting potential. During action potential, sodium channels open in order to initiate an impulse. If the sodium ion concentration is out of balance, the neuron function could be compromised.

9. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. In this case, administering a solution that is hypertonic to the cells would help. A hypertonic extracellular solution would draw water out of the swollen cells to counteract the effects of water intoxication. An isotonic solution would not help. A solution low in solute concentration would be high in water relative to the cells making the solution hypotonic, which would cause more water to enter the cells. A saline solution would be high in solutes and hypertonic to the cells.

10. The correct answer is B. With an extreme increase in water consumption, the plasma and blood volume increases, increasing blood pressure. The kidneys try to deal with this by increasing their filtration rate and increasing urine production to try to eliminate some of the excess water and reduce blood volume and pressure. What should not happen in this situation is to increase the retention of water in the body. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) normally increases water reabsorption in the nephron. You would expect the secretion of ADH to drop in this circumstance so that more water can be excreted by the kidneys.

11. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. In the proximal convoluted tubule, the primary events are the reabsorption of nutrients and water. There are two regions in the nephron where large amounts of sodium and water are reabsorbed. In the loop of Henle, the countercurrent multiplier system is used, which leads to the reabsorption of salts (sodium and chloride) and water. In the distal convoluted tubule, the hormone aldosterone influences the reabsorption of salts and water followed by osmosis.

12. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question relies on an understanding of the functions of brain structures. The cerebrum is involved in sensory processing, motor coordination, and association. The spinal cord relays messages to and from the brain and can process some reflex actions. The cerebellum deals with sensory-motor coordination, balance, and complex muscle movement patterns. The medulla oblongata is located in the brain stem; it has reflex centers for vital functions such as ventilation. Damage to the medulla oblongata could potentially be fatal.

13. The correct answer is A. The passage explains that Sertoli cells influence spermatogenesis. Therefore, the more Sertoli cells, theoretically, the more sperm should be produced. The two groups of men in this study varied in their sperm count. We are told that group 1 subjects had a normal sperm count while group 2 participants were seeking infertility treatments due to a low sperm count. Based on this information, the men with the higher sperm count should have a higher number of Sertoli cells. This would be group 1.

14. The correct answer is B. There are many relationships that could be deduced from these data. Keep in mind that the question says to consider the data from both groups, so we are looking for trends that are similar in groups 1 and 2. Choice A suggests a positive feedback relationship between FSH and LH. This would mean that as one of these hormones increases, so does the other. While this might be possible based on the group 1 data, it is not seen in the group 2 data. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ suggests a positive feedback relationship between testosterone and FSH. While this might be plausible for group 2 subjects, it is not for group 1 subjects. This leaves choice B. There is in fact a negative feedback relationship between inhibin-B and FSH. In groups 1 and 2, when inhibin-B was high, FSH was low. This suggests negative feedback. Since there is a relationship between some of these hormones, choice D can be eliminated.

15. The correct answer is C. The passage explains that group 1 men have normal sperm counts while group 2 men have low sperm counts. In looking at the data, the testosterone levels between groups 1 and 2 are not significantly different, which indicates that this hormone is not a good indicator of sperm count. The LH data for both groups tend to be fairly low and not drastically different between the groups. For FSH, the level is higher in the group 2 men who have a lower sperm count. Inhibin-B is the only feasible option as it is high in the men with normal sperm counts and low in the men with low sperm counts.

16. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The blood-testis barrier is described in the passage as a barricade to establish immune privilege for the testes. To answer this question, Answers and Explanations Passage III MCAT

Practice Test 1 you need to think about how the sperm cells in the testes would compare to other cells in the body. Sperm cells are haploid, and all are genetically different from each other and from other cells in the body. Because they are genetically different, they should express unique surface antigens. If the cells of the immune system were to contact the sperm, they would be perceived as foreign and could be subject to immune system attack, which would destroy the sperm. For this reason, the blood-testis barrier is required to keep the sperm away from the immune cells. The remaining choices do not make good sense. Sperm cells will eventually leave the reproductive system during ejaculation. It also would not make sense to indicate that the blood flow to the testes needs to be cut off. This would prevent oxygen and nutrient flow to the area. Preventing the sperm from moving to the epididymis before they are ready does not provide an explanation for why the sperm cells need to be kept separate from the cells of the immune system.

17. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question relies on your knowledge of the female reproductive cycle. In women, as FSH levels climb, follicles are stimulated to grow. These follicles produce estrogen, which exerts positive feedback on LH, whose levels begin to climb. When LH levels peak on the 14 th day of the cycle, the follicle ruptures, releasing the egg from the ovary and leaving the corpus luteum behind in the ovary. After ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes both estrogen and progesterone to inhibit GnRH. When GnRH is inhibited, FSH and LH will also be inhibited. Choice B correctly indicates that the LH surge causes ovulation.

18. The correct answer is A. This question relies on your knowledge of cell division. Mitosis is the process by which differentiated cells produce identical daughter cells.

Passage IV 19. The correct answer is C. Death of osteoblasts due to S. aureus infection is the result of induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis is triggered by capsase-8, so increasing the activity of capsase-8 would increase the rate of apoptosis and osteoblast death. Further, capsase-8 is activated by TRAIL made by S. aureus, so increasing the TRAIL activity would also increase osteoblast death rates. A drug that is antagonistic to TRAIL would decrease capsase-8 activity and decrease the rate of apoptosis in osteoblasts.

20. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The leukocytes that engulf microbes such as bacteria are macrophages. This process is termed phagocytosis. Basophils secrete histamine, which is involved in the initiation of the inflammatory response. Lymphocytes are involved in specific immune system defenses. Eosinophils are involved in the defense response to antigens from unique sources such as parasites.

21. The correct answer is C. Complement proteins circulate in the blood in an inactive form. When bacteria enter the blood, the complement proteins are activated, which causes a cascade of reactions that ultimately cause lysis and death of the bacteria. Antibody production or cytotoxic T-cell activation could certainly be stimulated by bacteria in the blood, but the question stipulated that this must be a nonspecific defense and these defenses are specific. Interleukins are cytokines secreted by immune cells, and they would not directly be able to defend against bacteria in the bloodstream.

22. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Bacteria spontaneously mutate in order to produce diversity in the population. Some bacteria have spontaneous mutations, usually on plasmids, that allow them to survive in the presence of certain antibiotics. If the bacterial population is repeatedly exposed to that antibiotic due to overuse, it exerts selective pressure where only the resistant bacteria survive. These resistant bacteria multiply, and in the next generation a higher frequency of resistance is observed. Antibiotic resistance has nothing to do with people becoming resistant to antibiotics-it is all about the bacterial mutations.

23. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question relies on your knowledge of bacterial cell structures and functions. The nucleoid is the region of the cell where the one circular loop of chromosomal DNA is located. The ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis. Bacteria can convert themselves to spores when environmental conditions are poor, allowing them to survive for extended periods of time in harsh conditions. The capsule is a sticky layer surrounding the cell that helps in the attachment of the cell to a surface. It is likely that the adhesins are located here.

24. The correct answer is A. Knowledge of the endocrine structures and hormones is needed to answer this question. The hormone calcitonin stimulates the storage of calcium in bone matrix. Its target is the osteoblasts that build new bone matrix. The calcitonin hormone is made by the thyroid gland. Parathyroid hormone is antagonistic to calcitonin and stimulates osteoclasts. Osteotonin is not a real hormone.

25. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Based on the data given, drug $\mathrm{Y}$ is the only treatment to show a mean decrease in pulmonary artery pressure, which is the goal of this experiment. While some individual patients in the drug $\mathrm{X}$ and placebo groups did show a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure, the overall results for these groups included an increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure.

26. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The results from the drug $\mathrm{X}$ group indicate that the treatment caused an increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure. This helps us to eliminate choice $\mathrm{A}$, which suggests that drug $\mathrm{X}$ is binding to ETA. If this were the case, the drug would be bound to ETA so that endothelin could only bind to ETB. When endothelin binds to ETB, vasodilation occurs, implying a decrease in pressure. This was not seen in the drug $\mathrm{X}$ group. Choice $\mathrm{B}$ suggests that drug $\mathrm{X}$ is selectively binding to the ETB receptor. This would mean that endothelin could only bind to ETA, which does in fact cause an increase in pressure. This would be the correct choice. Answers and Explanations Passage V MCAT

Practice Test 1 27. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. To answer this question, you must be familiar with the anatomy of the heart. The right side of the heart is the pulmonary circuit while the left side is the systemic circuit. Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium of the heart via the superior and inferior vena cava. Blood from the right atrium passes through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle and then leaves the heart through the pulmonary semilunar valve. Blood is carried via the pulmonary arteries to the lungs where gas exchange occurs. After gas exchange occurs, oxygenated blood returns to the heart via pulmonary veins to enter the left atrium. From there blood passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle. Blood leaves the left side of the heart by passing through the aortic valve into the aorta. If there was a pressure increase in the pulmonary arteries, the right ventricle of the heart would be most likely affected as it is the last chamber that blood is located in before it moves toward the lungs in the pulmonary arteries.

28. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Overexpression of the ETB receptor means that endothelin will have more ETB receptors to bind to. The passage indicates that when endothelin binds to the ETB receptor, vasodilation occurs, which decreases blood pressure. This would suggest that the patient's blood pressure would decrease, the explanation provided by choice B.

29. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This question expects you to be able to consider how the kidneys are involved in regulating blood volume and blood pressure. Water that is reabsorbed in the nephrons returns to the bloodstream to increase plasma volume, which in turn increases blood pressure as the volume of blood increases. When the nephrons absorb more water to increase blood volume, the urine volume decreases. The two hormones aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone help increase the amount of water reabsorbed by nephrons, which in turn decreases urine volume. In order to reduce blood pressure, the kidneys can decrease the amount of water reabsorbed by the nephrons. The less water reabsorbed means there will be less blood volume and less blood pressure. This would ultimately increase urine volume. The question asks how the kidneys might try to reduce hypertension. This would mean that we want less water reabsorbed into the blood, which would decrease blood volume and blood pressure. To do this, urine volume would have to increase.

30. The correct answer is B. The question suggests that ETA can be activated by certain types of endothelin, which causes ETA to synergize with growth factors to increase cell proliferation rates. Growth factors are one of many mechanisms used to regulate the cell cycle. Of the choices listed, A, C, and D can be eliminated as they have nothing to do with growth factors and cell proliferation. The only reasonable answer is choice B since one of the many characteristics of cancer is increased cell proliferation. 31. The correct answer is $C$. The data report estrogen concentration. From reviewing the data, it can be seen that the mutant strain generally has a higher estrogen concentration than the wild-type strain.

32. The correct answer is $D$. Rate-limiting steps generally require the highest activation energies and are the slowest steps in a metabolic pathway.

33. The correct answer is C. Estrogen levels typically peak prior to ovulation, triggering the LH surge that is responsible for ovulation. For this reason, we would see the highest levels of estrogen around the time of ovulation, which should lead to a decrease in total and LDL cholesterol levels at that time.

34. The correct answer is A. One primary role of cholesterol is to stabilize the plasma membrane and to regulate fluidity of the membrane.

35. The correct answer is C. Because the mutant mice have a higher estrogen level due to the mutation in the rate-limiting step, it is likely that their cholesterol levels will be lower. Since cholesterol is converted to estrogen, if that process is occurring more rapidly than normal, the cholesterol levels may be lower than normal since the cholesterol is being converted to estrogen.

36. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. In the mutant mice, cholesterol is converted to estrogen at a faster rate. We would expect sexually mature mice to have a reduced cholesterol level due to estrogen production as compared to a mouse that is not close to sexual maturity.

37. The correct answer is $B$. The passage explains that estrogen seems to provide some sort of protective role against HIV infection. There is no mention of the role of testosterone with this hypothesis, so we should assume that it is not important to this theory. Therefore, choices A and D can be eliminated. Choice C introduces the idea of a female who has had her ovaries removed. Since the ovaries produce estrogen, assume that this female's estrogen levels would be decreased. Based on the information in the passage, this female should have less protection against HIV infection due to the decreased estrogen levels. Choice B introduces a female who oversecretes estrogen. Since the passage tells us that estrogen provides some protection against HIV infection, this female should be the most likely candidate (of the choices listed) to be protected against HIV infection.

38. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. This question requires you to know some of the details of the female reproductive cycle including what hormones are involved following ovulation. Prior to ovulation, both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary and are involved in follicular growth and maturation. The secretion of both FSH and LH is stimulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone $(\mathrm{GnRH})$ from the hypothalamus. As the follicles grow and mature, they produce estrogen. During the second week of the cycle, increasing estrogen levels cause a spike in LH levels, which causes ovulation. Recall that following ovulation, the remnant of the follicle that stays in the Answers and Explanations Passage VI Passage VII MCAT

Practice Test 1 ovary is called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes both estrogen and progesterone, which inhibit the further release of FSH and LH. The question is asking about a unique hormone that causes increased risk of HIV following ovulation. Choices B and D can be eliminated because FSH and LH are hormones most active prior to ovulation. Choice $C$ is not appropriate since estrogen is secreted prior to and following ovulation. The only hormone that is unique to postovulation is progesterone, which makes choice A correct.

39. The correct answer is A. Since CCR5 is a coreceptor for HIV, up-regulation of the CCR5 allele should provide more receptors for HIV, making it more likely for more cells to become infected as is indicated by choice A. The remaining choices are not reasonable explanations. Since increased expression of CCR5 should make it easier for cells to become infected, choice B would not be plausible. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ does not provide an adequate explanation, particularly since the passage indicates that while in the earlier phases of infection, women carry higher lower loads than men. The passage also indicates that the delta-32 allele of CCR5 provides protection against HIV infection, not the normal CCR5 allele, which eliminates choice D.

40. The correct answer is B. To answer this question, you need to rely on your knowledge of genetics. The passage states that the delta-32 CCR5 mutation is protective against HIV infection. The question indicated that there are two different phenotypes noted within the delta-32 CCR5 mutation-one that offers near 100 percent protection against HIV infection and one that offers only partial protection. The best explanation for why two phenotypes (complete protection and partial protection) are observed would be that the delta-32 allele exhibits incomplete dominance. An individual that is homozygous for the allele (meaning he or she inherited two copies of the delta-32 allele) would have full protection, while an individual who is heterozygous (meaning he or she has one normal copy of the allele and one copy of the delta-32 allele) would have an intermediate phenotype (being partial protection). This is indicated by choice B. Since the question indicates that the differences in phenotype (protection) are related to the delta32 mutation, choices A and D can be eliminated as they suppose that something other than the allele is providing protection. Choice C suggests that epistasis is involved in masking the delta-32 allele. While this might sound remotely plausible, choice B is a much more likely explanation.

41. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. You need to know what retroviruses are and have a basic understanding of how they operate to answer this question. Retroviruses have the unique ability to transcribe their RNA to DNA (recall that the central dogma indicates DNA to RNA to protein) so that the viral genetic material can integrate into host cell chromosomes to initiate the latent phase of the life cycle. In order to transcribe the RNA to DNA, the enzyme reverse transcriptase is needed, which is indicated by choice $\mathrm{C}$. The other choices relate to enzymes that are not specific to retroviruses. DNA polymerase is used by cells to copy DNA during the process of semiconservative replication. RNA polymerase is used by cells to perform the conversion of DNA to RNA (transcription). Helicase is the enzyme in cells that is used to unwind the DNA double helix.

42. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The question explains that AZT and ddI interfere with replication and transcription. During a viral infection, the ideal situation would be to interfere with viral processes while leaving host cell processes unaffected. Choice A suggests that host cell DNA replication should be prevented in order to keep the host cell from functioning and mentions nothing about how this would affect the virus. Choice B is similar in that it does not mention how the virus would be affected. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is not appropriate because it discusses preventing infection. If the patient is already confirmed as infected, then this choice wouldn't make sense. If a person is infected with HIV, then the viral genetic material has already entered the host cells. If replication of the viral genome can be prevented as suggested by choice $\mathrm{D}$, then the progression of the infection can be slowed.

43. The correct answer is B. From the graph provided, it seems that culturable bacteria decreased significantly (almost to 0) during the course of antibiotic therapy, which indicates that the antibiotic treatment was successful at eliminating culturable bacteria. However, the number of nonculturable but metabolically active cells stayed approximately equal during the course of the antibiotic therapy, which suggests that those cells did not respond to the treatment. This eliminates choice A as a possible answer since not all E. coli were eliminated by antibiotic treatment. The culturable bacteria causing the infection were eliminated by antibiotic treatment, which removes choice $\mathrm{C}$ as a possible answer. Choice D suggests that the treatment increased the number of $E$. coli, which is in direct contrast to what is shown on the graph. The best conclusion is that while the culturable bacteria have been eliminated, the nonculturable bacteria have made the patient at risk for developing another UTI should the nonculturable bacteria resuscitate to culturable form. This is indicated by choice B.

44. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. To support theVBNC hypothesis, it is necessary to provide evidence that the cells are metabolically active. The presence of DNA, proteins, or an intact cell membrane within the cell does not necessarily provide sufficient evidence to indicate that the cells are metabolically active because these things could be found in dying or dead cells. This eliminates choices A, B, and C. However, if one could show evidence of transcription occurring within the cells, this would provide good support for the fact that they are metabolically active.

45. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. In order to answer this question, you need to be familiar with the anatomy of the male and female reproductive and urinary systems. The passage explains that the E. coli bacteria that are normal residents of the digestive tract can cause UTIs when they enter the urinary tract. This means that we are Answers and Explanations Passage VIII MCAT

Practice Test 1 looking for a difference between men and women that would allow the bacteria to move from the intestinal tract to the urinary tract. There would be no reasonable support to suggest that women have a poorer immune response than men or that the bacteria infecting women are more likely to be resistant to antibiotics. This eliminates choices $\mathrm{C}$ and D. The number of E. coli in the intestinal tract is insignificant because the only concern is whether they enter the urinary tract to cause infection, which eliminates choice A. In the anatomy of the female system, the urethra is much closer to the anus, which makes for a short traveling distance for the bacteria that are able to get to the urethra. In males, the urethra is longer and farther away from the anus, making it harder for the bacteria to get to the urethra. The anatomical difference suggested by choice B is the only reasonable explanation for why women are more likely to contract UTIs.

46. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Based on the data provided in the graph, the best assumption is that the trends seen in the graph would continue over time. It appears that the antibiotic therapy eliminated the culturable bacteria, so it would be safe to assume that the numbers of culturable bacteria would remain very low. This would eliminate choice A, which says that culturable cell count would increase. Since the cell counts for metabolically active cells did not decrease during the initial antibiotic treatment, there is no reason to assume that they would eventually decrease over a longer period, thus eliminating choices B and C. Based on the fact that the number of nonculturable bacteria did not decrease over the time period shown, we can assume that this is unlikely to change over a longer time course. Assuming that the trends seen in the graph continue, choice D is the most appropriate prediction.

47. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question relies on an understanding of antibiotic resistance. The overuse of antibiotics puts pressure on bacteria that selects for the bacteria that have mutated to become resistant to antibiotics. The overuse of antibiotics eliminates the susceptible bacteria, which leaves only the resistant bacteria to multiple to large numbers. Choice A suggests that people become immune to antibiotics, which is false. Since antibiotics are designed to target bacteria, bacteria are the only things that can become resistant to antibiotics. Since antibiotics normally kill bacteria, choice D would not make sense since it suggests that the use of antibiotics would increase the populations of resident bacteria. Choice C just isn't logical. Since many antibiotics are used on a routine basis, we know that they don't typically cause massive organ damage.

48. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. If the VBNC cells were able to resuscitate to fully metabolically active cells, this would indicate that they were not in the process of dying.

No passage 49. The correct answer is A. This question relies on a knowledge of dominant and recessive patterns of inheritance. Dominant alleles are expressed, even in the heterozygous individual. In this case, our example is a dominant allele that causes a fatal condition. Since every individual carrying a single allele of this type would likely not survive, we would expect the frequency of the allele to decrease over time. In contrast, disorders that follow recessive patterns of inheritance require two copies of the allele for expression. Those who are heterozygous do not express the disorder and thus would survive.

50. The correct answer is B. Antibodies are proteins that are secreted from the cell. Proteins would be produced and labeled by the rough endoplasmic reticulum. From there, they would be sorted by the Golgi complex and finally directed to the cell membrane for secretion.

51. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question relies on a knowledge of the basic chemical composition of the biologically important molecules. Carbohydrates and lipids are composed of C, O, and H. However, DNA is a nucleic acid and contains phosphate groups.

52. The correct answer is A. This question is asking how to move a potassium ion (which is small) from an area that has a low concentration to an area with a relatively higher concentration. In this case we are moving against the concentration gradient. The transport type that could do this is active transport, using energy to move the ions against their concentration gradient.

53. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. During the electron transport chain, oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor during aerobic respiration. In addition to serving as an electron acceptor, the oxygen also gathers protons from the electron transport chain, producing water in the process.

54. The correct answer is C. This question relies on your knowledge of semiconservative DNA replication where a single double helix is separated in order for both strands of the double helix to serve as templates for the production of new strands.

55. The correct answer is A. Of the choices presented, the only accurate choice is A. DNA nucleotides utilize the sugar deoxyribose while RNA nucleotides utilize the sugar ribose. Of the remaining choices, B is incorrect because we know that DNA uses $\mathrm{T}$ nucleotides while RNA uses $U$ nucleotides. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because RNA is produced in transcription and a protein is produced in translation. Finally, choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because DNA is double-stranded and RNA is single-stranded.

56. The correct answer is C. In order to answer this question you need to recall the human diploid number of 46 . In mitosis, a diploid parent cell produces two diploid daughter cells.

57. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Steroid hormones exert their effects by entering into cells and binding with a receptor in the cytoplasm. The hormone-receptor complex then enters the nucleus where it acts to alter gene expression in the cell. Since the question is asking about nonsteroid, or peptide, hormones, choices A and B can be eliminated. Choice D can also be eliminated as this is not a plausible explanation. Nonsteroid hormones act as first messengers, binding to their receptors on the Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 1 cell membrane. The hormone itself does not enter the cell. The binding of the first messenger to the receptor causes a series of reactions in the cell that ultimately activate second messengers, such as cAMP.

58. The correct answer is A. RNA polymerase binds to the promoter site on the DNA template, at which time it is free to begin transcription. The regulator gene is a type of control gene that produces a small protein called a repressor. The operon is a group of linked genes composed of the operator and its adjacent structural genes.

59. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. During anaerobic respiration, glycolysis and fermentation occur. The process of fermentation does not produce ATP. The only ATP made during anaerobic respiration is from glycolysis. The net gain of ATP in glycolysis per molecule of ATP is 2 . If the cell has access to 6 molecules of glucose and each molecule will produce 2 ATP, then a total of 12 ATP will be produced. 

\section{Section 2. Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems}

Answers and Explanations

1. The correct answer is B. As described in the passage, treatment of olefins with Passage I acid results in a carbocationic intermediate, which is prone to shifts and rearrangements. In this case, a hydride shift is very facile, the driving force being the conversion of a secondary cation into a tertiary variety. Subsequent capture of the electrophilic center with water, followed by proton transfer, leads to Product B.

2. The correct answer is A. As described in the passage, the use of mercuric ion prevents the formation of a formal carbocation, and therefore suppresses rearrangements. The intermediate mercurinium ion is captured by water at either secondary position to give an organomercury compound, which is demercurated with sodium borohydride to give Product A.

3. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Product $\mathrm{B}$ is the only product with symmetry (specifically, an internal mirror plane); therefore, there are two sets of carbon atoms related by symmetry, which give rise to only one signal for each set. The other three products lack this symmetry element and are expected to exhibit peaks for all 8 carbons in the skeleton.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_d0387ee1dfec4e017221g-093.jpg?height=225&width=238&top_left_y=1747&top_left_x=824)

4. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. There are two chiral centers and the molecule is chiral. Both the cis- and trans-isomers have two chiral centers (the tertiary centers are connected to four different groups); however, the cis-isomer possesses a mirror plane that destroys the chirality on a molecular level. In other words, the cisisomer is a meso compound. The trans-isomer lacks this symmetry element and thus is classified as a chiral molecule. MCAT

Practice Test 1 5. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The demercuration step involves the attack of hydride on the carbon bearing the mercury, resulting in a net $2 \mathrm{e}^{-}$reduction from $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$ to $\mathrm{Hg}^{0}$, as shown:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_d0387ee1dfec4e017221g-094.jpg?height=154&width=550&top_left_y=552&top_left_x=901)

No passage 6. The correct answer is C. As noted in the text of the problem, the flying bird is subject to four forces: weight, drag, lift, and thrust. Since the bird has mass, it is subject to the force due to gravity or weight, which acts straight downward. Thus, choice B can be eliminated. Drag is the air resistance force encountered in flight, a force that acts opposite to the direction of flight motion. Since the bird in the diagram is moving to the left, drag is a force represented by an arrow directed to the left. This is provided by choice $\mathrm{C}$, the correct choice. Lift is an upward-directed force, and thrust is the pushing force acting to propel the bird in the direction of its motion-to the left.

7. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The blood's volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is related to flow velocity, $v$, by the following relation:

$$
Q=v A
$$

where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the blood vessel. The volumetric flow rate must first be converted to units of $\frac{\mathrm{cm}^{3}}{\mathrm{~s}}$ :

$$
Q=5 \frac{L}{\min } \times \frac{1000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}{1 \mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~min}}{60 \mathrm{~s}}=83.3 \frac{\mathrm{cm}^{3}}{\mathrm{~s}}
$$

The cross-sectional area of the vessel, $A$, is:

$$
A=\pi r^{2}=(3.14)(1.2 \mathrm{~cm})^{2}=4.52 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}
$$

Thus, the blood flow velocity is:

$$
v=\frac{83.3 \frac{\mathrm{cm}^{3}}{\mathrm{~s}}}{4.52 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}}=18.4 \frac{\mathrm{cm}}{\mathrm{s}}
$$

8. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The current, $I$, is related to the amount of charge, $\Delta q$, that flows during a time interval, $\Delta t$, by:

$$
I=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t} \Rightarrow \Delta q=I \cdot \Delta t=(15 \mathrm{~A})(0.007 \mathrm{~s})=0.105 \mathrm{C}
$$

Passage II 9. The correct answer is C. Because the steps of the reaction and the listed heats of reaction are exactly aligned to how the reaction takes place, there is no need to switch any reactions or reverse any signs for the heats of reaction. This allows you to simply add up the heats of reaction: $+92+121+496-349-771=-411 \mathrm{~kJ}$. 10. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The chloride ion has 18 electrons now that it has gained an electron. The new configuration will show a stable octet in the $3 \mathrm{~s}$ and $3 \mathrm{p}$ orbitals combined: $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6}$.

11. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The lattice energy increases with increasing charge. Clearly the negative two charge of sulfur is greater. Also, sulfur is about the same size as chlorine, meaning that for the (almost) same size ions, the sulfur has double the negative charge.

12. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The lattice energy is always a positive value, eliminating choices $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{D}$. The lattice energy is also the formation of the solid lattice structure from the gaseous ions, the fifth elementary step. Finally, looking at the chart you see that LiCl and $\mathrm{KCl}$ have their values listed. Using periodic trends and relationships, the lattice energy for $\mathrm{NaCl}$ should fall in between those of $\mathrm{LiCl}$ and $\mathrm{KCl}$.

13. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The stable sodium element has 11 protons in the nucleus and 11 orbiting electrons. The sodium ion lacks 1 electron needed for stability, giving it an overall positive charge of $+1$. The correct Lewis structure for the sodium ion is $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

14. The correct answer is A. When heat energy is absorbed, the electrons enter a higher energy state. Light is emitted when the electrons fall back to the ground state.

15. The correct answer is C. This question can be solved using the lens equation: Passage III

$$
\frac{1}{\text { object distance }}+\frac{1}{\text { image distance }}=\frac{1}{\text { focal length }}
$$

The reader can substitute the values for object distance and focal length from each option into the above equation and solve for the image distance which, for Lens Scenario 3, yields:

$$
\frac{1}{\text { image distance }}=\frac{1}{\text { focal length }}-\frac{1}{\text { object distance }}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{f}}-\frac{1}{\mathrm{f}}=0
$$

which implies an undefined image. The solution could also be determined by drawing a ray diagram.

16. The correct answer is $D$. This problem can be solved using the lens equation:

$$
\frac{1}{\text { object distance }}+\frac{1}{\text { image distance }}=\frac{1}{\text { focal length }}
$$

The reader can substitute the values for object distance and focal length from each option into the above equation and Lens Scenario 4 yields:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\text { image distance }} & =\frac{1}{\text { focal length }}-\frac{1}{\text { object distance }} \\
& =\frac{1}{\mathrm{f}}-\frac{1}{\mathrm{f} / 2}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{f}}-\frac{2}{\mathrm{f}}=-\frac{1}{\mathrm{f}}
\end{aligned}
$$

In other words, image distance $=-$ focal length. A negative image distance implies a virtual image, which is always upright. The solution could also be determined by drawing a ray diagram. Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 1 

17. The correct answer is $C$. This question can be solved using the lens equation:

$$
\frac{1}{\text { object distance }}+\frac{1}{\text { image distance }}=\frac{1}{\text { focal length }}
$$

Substituting the values for object distance and focal length from Lens Scenario 2 :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\text { image distance }} & =\frac{1}{\text { focal length }}-\frac{1}{\text { object distance }} \\
& =\frac{1}{\mathrm{f}}-\frac{1}{2 \mathrm{f}}=\frac{2}{2 \mathrm{f}}-\frac{1}{2 \mathrm{f}}=\frac{1}{2 \mathrm{f}}
\end{aligned}
$$

In other words, image distance $=2 \mathrm{f}$, given by choice $\mathrm{C}$.

18. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The image magnification, $m$, can be determined from the equation:

$$
m=-\frac{\text { image distance }}{\text { object distance }}
$$

One first needs to determine the image distance for Lens Scenario 1 by using the lens equation:

$$
\frac{1}{\text { object distance }}+\frac{1}{\text { image distance }}=\frac{1}{\text { focal length }}
$$

Substituting the values for object distance and focal length from Lens Scenario 1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\text { image distance }} & =\frac{1}{\text { focal length }}-\frac{1}{\text { object distance }} \\
& =\frac{1}{\mathrm{f}}-\frac{1}{3 \mathrm{f}}=\frac{3}{3 \mathrm{f}}-\frac{1}{3 \mathrm{f}}=\frac{2}{3 \mathrm{f}}
\end{aligned}
$$

In other words, image distance $=\frac{3 \mathrm{f}}{2} \mathrm{~cm}$. Substituting the information provided for Lens Scenario 1 yields:

$$
m=-\frac{\text { image distance }}{\text { object distance }}=-\frac{\frac{3 f}{2} \mathrm{~cm}}{3 \mathrm{f} \mathrm{cm}}=-\frac{1}{2}
$$

The fact that $m$ is negative implies that the image is inverted with respect to the object. The value of $\frac{1}{2}$ implies that it is smaller than the object or reduced by 2 .

19. The correct answer is A. One first starts with the lens equation and then solves for the focal length, $f$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\text { focal length }} & =\frac{1}{\text { object distance }}+\frac{1}{\text { image distance }} \\
& =\frac{\text { image distance }+\text { object distance }}{\text { (object distance) (image distance) }}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the focal length is:

$$
\text { focal length }=\frac{(\text { object distance })(\text { image distance })}{\text { image distance }+\text { object distance }}
$$

20. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The molecule in the box is already in an eclipsed conformation required for a Fischer projection. Therefore, since the bromines are on opposite sides in the dash-wedge projection, they must also be on opposite sides in the Fischer, and we can exclude choices A and D. The remaining choices (B and C) are enantiomeric-distinguishing between the two is best carried out by imagining a vantage point from above the dash-wedge representation, as shown:

It is then apparent that the upper bromine would point to the right and the lower bromine would be directed to the left of the observer.

The chemical transformation involves a Jones oxidation of the primary alcohol to form a carboxylic acid, followed by treatment with diazomethane to form the methyl ester, as shown:

22. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The product is an alkene without optical activity. The starting material, $(S)$-2-chloro-4-methylpentane, possesses a good leaving group on a secondary center with adjacent protons. Therefore, all four common pathways ( $\mathrm{S}_{N} 1, \mathrm{~S}_{N} 2$, E1, and $\left.\mathrm{E} 2\right)$ are available to it. However, potassium tert-butoxide 
destroyed; therefore, the product cannot exhibit optical activity.

Passage IV 23. The correct answer is C. Choice A shows the wrong formula for calcium hydroxide, and choice B is not correctly balanced. Choice D shows calcium ion reacting, instead of the appropriate calcium metal. The complete, balanced equation is choice C.

24. The correct answer is A. Looking at the series, $K$ and Na will react with water as they are very reactive metals. Only calcium, strontium, and barium from Group 2 do react with water. Mg does not and is the first in the series not to react with water.

25. The correct answer is C. Cobalt is more reactive than the copper and less reactive than iron. This puts the activity of copper between the two. There is no basis from the passage to compare cobalt's activity to that of lead.

26. The correct answer is D. Nickel is better at losing electrons than silver. Therefore, silver ions will attract electrons from nickel and become solid silver. Only copper, silver, and gold will be resistant to acid from the series. Chromium will react with acid. Calcium is better at losing electrons than aluminum. Therefore, aluminum ions will attract electrons from calcium and become solid aluminum. Choice D is false because tin has a lesser tendency to lose electrons than nickel.

27. The correct answer is $B$. Chromium has 24 electrons, and it has one of the anomalous electron configurations of $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6} \underline{3 d^{5} 4 s^{1}}$.

No passage 28. The correct answer is D. A diamagnetic element is characterized by the fact that all of its electrons are paired. Of the four choices, the only metal that fits this description is copper.

29. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The number of neutrons is the mass number $A$ minus the atomic number $Z$. Thus, the number of neutrons of iodine-131 is $N=A-Z=$ $131-53=78$

30. The correct answer is A. The weight of an object or a substance can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
W=\mathrm{mg}
$$

Weight $=($ mass $)($ acceleration due to gravity $)$

To find the mass of the blood sample, one uses the density equation:

$$
\rho=\frac{m}{V}
$$

where $\rho=$ density, $m=$ mass, and $V=$ volume. Given in the problem are the density of blood $\left(\rho=1.06 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$ and the volume of blood $\left(V=10 \mathrm{~mL}=10 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\right)$. Rearranging the above equation for mass and substituting known values yields:

$$
m=\rho V=\left(1.06 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)\left(10 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\right)=10.6 \mathrm{~g}
$$

However, in order to substitute into the equation for weight, mass must be expressed in terms of kilograms, not grams, which results in $0.0106 \mathrm{~kg}$. Thus, $W=(0.0106 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)=0.104 \mathrm{~N}$.

31. The correct answer is C. Sulfur is lower on the periodic table, therefore methyl thiolate is both more polarizable (thus, more nucleophilic) and larger (less basic).

32. The correct answer is D. Just as sulfur is lower on the periodic table than oxygen, iodine is lower than chlorine; therefore, iodide is more polarizable and more nucleophilic than chloride. The same top-to-bottom trend makes iodide less basic than chloride. Neither is terribly basic; nevertheless, inasmuch as chloride is the stronger base (i.e., weaker conjugate acid), it is the poorer leaving group.

33. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Methyl thiolate is the stronger nucleophile; iodide is the better leaving group. Therefore, the most favorable reaction will be between those two species.

34. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Increasing temperature always increases rate. The rate enhancement for elimination will be greater because of entropy effects, but both processes will be faster.

35. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Methanol is a polar protic solvent, which tends to retard $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2$ by strongly coordinating to the nucleophile. Ether and THF are not protic, but they are only moderately polar. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a very polar aprotic solvent, which coordinates cations very effectively but leaves the anion "naked" and more prone to engage in nucleophilic attack.

36. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Before you can draw a free-body diagram representing the Passage VII mass, you must first identify the forces acting on the mass. Because the object has mass, it has weight that acts downward. In addition, because the mass is attached to a string, the string exerts a force of tension through the string, directed upward. The free-body diagram that correctly represents these forces in magnitude and direction is the diagram depicted in choice $\mathrm{B}$. Answers and Explanations 37. The correct answer is A. In order to determine the acceleration of the system, Practice Test 1 one must apply Newton's second law to each of the two masses in Atwood's machine. Since each mass is moving in the $y$-direction:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& m_{1}: \quad \sum F_{y}=m a_{y} \quad m_{2}: \quad \quad \sum F_{y}=m a_{y} \\
& T-m_{1} g=m_{1} a \quad m_{2} g-T=m_{2} a \\
& T=m_{1} a+m_{1} g \quad T=m_{2} g-m_{2} a
\end{aligned}
$$

Setting the two expressions for the tension, $T$, equal to one another yields:

$$
m_{1} a+m_{1} g=m_{2} g-m_{2} a
$$

Solving for $a$ yields:

$$
a=\frac{\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)} g
$$

38. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The information given in the problem was that Atwood's machine has $m_{1}=140 \mathrm{~g}$ and $m_{2}=160 \mathrm{~g}$. As was shown in the solution to the previous problem, the tension expressed in terms of either of the masses is:

$$
T=m_{1} a+m_{1} g \quad \text { or } \quad T=m_{2} g-m_{2} a
$$

Either expression can be used, but the acceleration of the system needs to be determined. The general expression for the acceleration (which was the basis for the previous problem) is:

$$
a=\frac{\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)} g
$$

Substituting given values:

$$
a=\frac{(0.16 \mathrm{~kg}-0.14 \mathrm{~kg})}{(0.14 \mathrm{~kg}+0.16 \mathrm{~kg})}\left(9.8 \frac{m}{s^{2}}\right)=0.65 \frac{m}{s^{2}}
$$

Substituting into the equation in terms of $m_{1}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
T & =m_{1} a+m_{1} g=(0.14 \mathrm{~kg})\left(0.65 \frac{m}{s^{2}}\right)+(0.14 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.8 \frac{m}{s^{2}}\right) \\
& =0.091 \mathrm{~N}+1.372 \mathrm{~N}=1.46 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

You could also substitute into the equation in terms of $m_{2}$ and obtain the same result for $\mathrm{T}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
T & =m_{2} g-m_{2} a=(0.16 \mathrm{~kg})\left(9.8 \frac{m}{s^{2}}\right)-(0.16 \mathrm{~kg})\left(0.65 \frac{m}{s^{2}}\right) \\
& =1.568 \mathrm{~N}-0.104 \mathrm{~N}=1.46 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

39. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The expression for the acceleration (determined in the second problem of this set) is:

$$
a=\frac{\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)} g
$$

where $m_{1}=80 \mathrm{~g}$ and $m_{2}=220 \mathrm{~g}$. Substituting all given values:

$$
a=\frac{(0.22 \mathrm{~kg}-0.08 \mathrm{~kg})}{(0.08 \mathrm{~kg}+0.22 \mathrm{~kg})}\left(9.8 \frac{m}{s^{2}}\right)=4.57 \frac{m}{s^{2}}
$$

40. The correct answer is A. To determine an expression for the tension in Atwood's machine, you can begin with the same two equations of motion for the two masses derived from Newton's second law of motion or:

$$
m_{1}: T-m_{1} g=m_{1} a \quad m_{2}: m_{2} g-T=m_{2} a
$$

Solving both equations for the acceleration, $a$, yields:

$$
m_{1}: a=\frac{T-m_{1} g}{m_{1}} \quad m_{2}: a=\frac{m_{2} g-T}{m_{2}}
$$

Setting the expressions equal to each other and solving for $T$ yields:

$$
T=g\left(\frac{2 m_{1} m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}\right)
$$

Substituting all given information yields the tension, $T$ :

$$
T=\left(9.8 \frac{m}{s^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{2 \cdot 0.11 \mathrm{~kg} \cdot 0.19 \mathrm{~kg}}{0.11 \mathrm{~kg}+0.19 \mathrm{~kg}}\right)=1.37 \mathrm{~N} \approx 1.4 \mathrm{~N}
$$

41. The correct answer is A. To find the effect of pulley friction on the system in Atwood's machine, one must first apply Newton's second law to the system:

$$
\sum F_{n e t}=m_{2} g-m_{1} g-f=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) a
$$

where downward is considered to be positive. Solving for the acceleration yields:

$$
a=\frac{m_{2} g-m_{1} g-f}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)}
$$

42. The correct answer is $D$. This question requires basic knowledge of the equation of a line which is:

$$
y=m x+b
$$

where $y$ is the $y$ variable, $x$ is the $x$ variable, $m$ is the slope, and $b$ is the $y$ intercept. The acceleration of the system using a pulley with friction is:

$$
a=\frac{m_{2} g-m_{1} g-f}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)}
$$

which can be rewritten as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a & =\frac{\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right) g}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)}-\frac{f}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)} \\
& =\frac{g}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)}\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)-\frac{f}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Answers and Explanations where $a$ is the $y$-variable, $\frac{g}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)}$ is the slope $(m),\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)$ is the $x$-variable, and $\frac{-f}{\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)}$ is the $y$-intercept. Calculating the $y$-intercept from the graph and substituting for the two masses, one can calculate the frictional force, given by choice $\mathrm{D}$.

Passage VII 43. The correct answer is C. The chromate esters of their hydrates cannot decompose by proton loss. Both ketones and aldehydes form carbonyl hydrates, and those hydrates form equilibrium quantities of chromate ester. However, in the case of ketones, the decomposition of the inorganic ester would require the departure of a carbocation, for which there is a considerably higher barrier than for a proton.

44. The correct answer is B. Without water, no carbonyl hydrate can be formed, thus trapping the aldehyde at that stage.

45. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The most likely product would be an oxo aldehyde. Jones conditions will oxidize the secondary alcohol to the ketone and the primary alcohol to the carboxylic acid.

47. The correct answer is A. The most likely compound isolated is an alcohol. For much the same reason that ketones do not overoxidize, tertiary alcohols are resistant to oxidation by chromium (VI) reagents, since it would require the departure of a carbocation in the chromate ester decomposition step.

48. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. $\alpha$-D-glucose and $\beta$-D-glucose differ by a single stereocenter. If one or more-but not all-stereocenters are different, the two compounds are diastereomers. In an enantiomer, each and every stereocenter must have changed. Thus, the enantiomer of D-glucose is L-glucose:

49. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The hemiacetal functionality is highlighted in glucose shown. Note that the hemiacetal carbon is in the same oxidation state as a carbonyl group, which is revealed by 2 bonds to oxygen. In an acetal, 2 alkoxy groups are attached to 1 carbon; in a hemiacetal, one is a hydroxy group and the other is an alkoxy group:

Passage IX 53. The correct answer is C. All nitrates and chlorides are soluble. However, chlorides of silver, lead, and mercury are not soluble. The expected product is silver chloride.

54. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. At $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the amount of $\mathrm{NaCl}$ dissolved will be $39.12$ grams. But because this amount is per $100 \mathrm{~mL}$ of water, you need to adjust for using $250 \mathrm{~mL}$ of water. Doing so, you get $39.12$ grams $\times 2.5=97.8$ grams dissolving in $250 \mathrm{~mL}$ of water. At $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the saturated solution will hold $35.7$ grams $\times$ $2.5=89.3$ grams. So the difference of $8.6$ grams will precipitate out of solution.

55. The correct answer is C. In order to conduct electricity, there must be free ions in solution. By creating products that are insoluble, the number of free ions is minimal.

56. The correct answer is A. All sodium salts are soluble. Looking over the other choices, there are compounds containing other cations that are sometimes soluble and sometimes not. The experimental data indicate that the only true statement here is choice A.

57. The correct answer is D. The first three choices are all false statements. Silver nitrate is an example of a soluble silver compound. Sodium phosphate is an example of a soluble phosphate compound. An example of a soluble sulfate compound is ammonium sulfate. Looking at choice D, you have the following reaction in water: $\mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s}) \longleftrightarrow \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(aq). The addition of ammonia to the solution forms a complex ion with silver ion. This reaction proceeds as: $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}(\mathrm{aq})+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Ag}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{2}^{+}$(aq). As the ammonia removes the silver ions from solution, the equilibrium is shifted to the right and the silver chloride becomes more soluble.

No passage 58. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Looking at the choices, three of the pairs are conjugate acid-base pairs, which differ by an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. However, choice B has the two substances differing by $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$ions. The conjugate base of sulfuric acid would be $\mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-}$. $\mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-}$ would also be the conjugate acid of $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$.

59. The correct answer is D. A total of 9 ions are formed when hydroxyapatite dissolves. Because the coefficient of each ion becomes the power of the concentration, you have $[x]^{5} \cdot[x]^{3} \cdot[x]^{1}=[x]^{9}$.

2. The correct answer is A. Conflict theory states that society is fundamentally in conflict when there is an uneven distribution of resources, and that power struggles between groups of people create divisiveness across gender, race, and socioeconomic status.

3. The correct answer is A. The bystander effect is characterized by slowness in response due to diffusion of responsibility. The more people who are present, the less an individual is likely to feel responsible to respond to the emergency because of the collective presence of other individuals.

4. The correct answer is C. Altruism is more likely to occur between individuals who are likely to reciprocate assistance in the future. Studies of altruistic behavior have shown that helping others occurs more frequently among family members and in smaller communities and where it is most likely to be reciprocated in the future.

5. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. During variable-ratio trials the rat is reinforced after a Passage I specific number of bar presses. The number of presses varies over time. As a result, the rat presses the bar more vigorously. Further, this type of reinforcement has a higher resistance to extinction because the reinforcement schedule itself varies.

6. The correct answer is C. Conditioning would occur more slowly, and the slope in each cell would be flatter. The longer the delay between the response and reinforcement, the more slowly conditioning occurs.

7. The correct answer is $D$. Fixed-ratio responses are characterized by a high rate of bar presses, and the short break taken by the rat is indicative of a fixed period of bar presses. Under fixed reinforcement the rat will press the bar quickly because responses are tied to the number of presses and not a time interval.

8. The correct answer is C. Ratio reinforcement usually results in predictable response patterns under each of the conditions (fixed and variable), with steady responding in a 1:1 ratio, and multiple rapid bar presses in the variable response ratio condition with long breaks in between. The variable nature of the reinforcement results in greater resistance to extinction in later trials as the rat continues with the behavior even in the absence of reinforcement in hopes of eventually getting a reinforcement.

9. The correct answer is A. In operant conditioning the stimulus always precedes the reinforcement or punishment. In the model of operant conditioning, the punishment or reinforcement of a behavior results in the increase or decrease of MCAT

Practice Test 1

Passage II that behavior. The behavior is elicited by the stimulus and therefore precedes the conditioning.

10. The correct answer is A. The largest proportion of responders are in the conventional level because most people never reach the postconventional level. This is consistent with Kohlberg's model and is expected based on the data pattern.

11. The correct answer is C. Conventional morality develops between the ages of 7 and 16. It develops as preconventional morality extinguishes. The key period for this change is between 7 and 16 years old.

12. The correct answer is B. Moral judgments can be understood in context based on stages of moral development. In Kohlberg's model, the reasons given by the research subjects for answering questions a particular way defined which level of development was being exhibited.

13. The correct answer is D. Stage 3 morality is characterized by the basing of decisions on personally constructed moral principles rather than on the likelihood of reward or punishment, or society's rules or laws. According to Kohlberg, someone functioning at this level would be able to reject personal fulfillment and unjust laws in order to make moral decisions.

14. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. James is displaying behavior consistent with the conventional stage of moral development. In this stage decisions are based on society's rules and laws with judgments based on relatively absolute criteria (black/white, right/wrong).

Passage III 15. The correct answer is B. Changing the location of the comparison light allows researchers to isolate where the light from the test stimuli reaches the retina. When the comparison light is located at the fixation point, the light falls on the fovea, where the cones are located. When the test light is presented away from the fixation point (in the periphery), the rods are activated.

16. The correct answer is A. The participant is considered to have detected the light if he or she can identify the comparison light presence $50 \%$ of the time. Using signal detection, the presence and absence of the test light is manipulated along with the intensity of the light.

17. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The rods are maximally sensitive after 20 minutes in the dark and are more sensitive overall. Cones are initially more sensitive than rods but become less so after the rod-cone break. At the breakpoint, cones and rods are equally sensitive. Rods only become more sensitive at a lower level of light after the breakpoint.

18. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Rods cannot distinguish between different wavelengths, therefore rod-based light perception is on the black and white gradient and is the primary form of human visual perception after the rod-cone break.

19. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Rods are better at light adaptation because large groups of them are connected to one interneuron. The interneuron amplifies the signal from each rod receptor decreasing resolution while increasing overall sensitivity to light.

20. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The individual spent a longer amount of time solving Passage IV algebra problems in a group compared to solving them alone.

21. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The results are consistent with social loafing. This concept is exemplified when an individual reduces his or her effort on a task based on the assumption that other members of the group will "step up" to complete the task. Social loafing is more likely to occur in the context of a more difficult or cognitively-demanding task.

22. The correct answer is A. Social facilitation is exemplified when an individual increases his or her effort on a task in a group situation; Social facilitation is more likely to happen when the task is relatively easy or simple to complete.

23. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The individual would reduce the amount of effort spent on solving the problems because he or she would assume others would step up to complete the task. This result is consistent with social loafing, which posits that as group size and task complexity increase, the amount of effort expended by individuals decreases.

24. The correct answer is A. The effort expended is the result of the participant's perception of diffusion of responsibility. Social loafing is characterized by the reduction in effort by individuals when they work in groups. This result is consistent even when individuals think that they are working alone regardless of whether or not they are actually working alone. The individual's perception about the presence of others is more critical to this process than the actuality of the presence of others.

25. The correct answer is C. Individuals identifying as "African American" are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, and individuals who identify as "White" are more likely to be diagnosed with a mood disorder.

26. The correct answer is C. Clinicians see no ethnicity differences in admittance rates for some disorders. This conclusion can be ruled out because the observable data collected contradict this statement. However, it is not possible to determine the degree of influence that ethnicity has on the rates of diagnoses or on the incidence rate in these studies since it only assesses those admitted for psychiatric care. It does not measure the rate of diagnosis or population prevalence of psychiatric disorders.

27. The correct answer is A. A logical follow-up study would measure the social and economic status and stress of each person diagnosed with schizophrenia and mood disorder. This is the most correct answer because such a study would further investigate the environmental causes for mental disorders. This additional research also fits with the vulnerability-stress view of schizophrenia.

28. The correct answer is D. A person has a $100 \%$ chance of developing schizophrenia if both of his or her parents have schizophrenia. This answer is incorrect because Answers and Explanations

Passage V MCAT

Practice Test 1 even though schizophrenia is heritable, genetic factors alone are not responsible for the development of the disorder and a child inherits $50 \%$ of each parent's genotype. This would not guarantee that a child would receive the genetic sequence that is required to be susceptible to this complex, polygenic disorder of schizophrenia.

29. The correct answer is A. The more stress to which a person who is genetically predisposed to schizophrenia is exposed, the greater the likelihood that person will experience a psychotic break. The vulnerability-stress view suggests that environmental stressors are correlated to the expression of schizophrenic symptoms. As these stressors increase, the likelihood increases that a person biologically predisposed to schizophrenia will exhibit symptoms. The research is still ongoing with regard to answer $\mathrm{C}$ and the vulnerability-stress model does not currently recognize differences in positive and negative stress. Answer $\mathrm{D}$ would require the individual to experience stress along with the biological family to fulfill the requirements of the model. If the individual was adopted and has no contact with the biological family, the biological family's stress will not trigger a schizophrenic break.

Passage VI 30. The correct answer is C. Commitment initially increases slowly; then it rapidly increases. The model depicts commitment increasing slowly. Then as passion begins to drop, commitment increases rapidly.

31. The correct answer is C. Commitment is crucial and is positively correlated to relationship stability. Various studies have shown that commitment is predictive of relationship stability. Commitment is also shown in the model to be at the highest level for the greatest length of time.

32. The correct answer is A. Romantic love is characterized by intense emotions and sexual feelings. The passion component develops quickly and early in the relationship and declines rapidly as commitment increases.

33. The correct answer is D. Companionate love develops over time and is characterized in Sternberg's model by commitment and intimacy. Choice A is incorrect because if the individual components that make up fatuous love and liking were present, it would be consummate love.

34. The correct answer is D. Although Danna has been with Mark for some time, their relationship is best categorized as infatuation due to the lack of commitment and intimacy in the context of strong sexual feelings.

Passage VII 35. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The majority of state average scores were above the national average. Sixteen of the states listed were below the national average and 34 were above. Most state average scores exceeded the national average.

36. The correct answer is $D$. Conflict theory posits that the difference in prestige and resources creates fundamental power struggles between groups of people and that these power struggles create divisiveness across groups. In the example given, the sociologist is examining differences in groups that are historically underperforming and evaluating how power divisiveness is being minimized.

37. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The data reflect attempts to reinforce the status quo between various state populations. Functionalists view education as structured in such a way that it reinforces the status quo. It keeps societies stable and seeks to avoid disruptions in the system.

38. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Teaching in the state school system is part of the service, or tertiary, sector of the economy. The primary sector includes the extractive industries such as mining and forestry. The secondary sector includes the manufacturing industries.

39. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Jim is attempting to maintain the status quo and is attempting to prevent disruptions in the existing system. His work is consistent with functionalism.

40. The correct answer is D. The share of the elderly population in Japan will increase over time relative to the rest of the population. In the graphs, the share of elderly people, shown as the top portion of each population "pyramid," is projected to increase over time relative to the shares of young and adult persons (shown as the bottom and middle portions of each population "pyramid").

41. The correct answer is B. There would be fewer transitional youth in the population in 2060 than in 2010. The transitional youth category is an additional age group between the ages of 15 and 30. It would overlap the existing youth and adult populations and would show the same overall pattern of reduction shown in both those populations over time.

42. The correct answer is A. Social and cultural characteristics would become more diverse across the population. This result is consistent with more mobile societies and reflects the changing demographics that would be evident from an addition of individuals from different backgrounds.

43. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The elderly are likely to have more influence on public policy as their share of the population increases.

44. The correct answer is D. The ethnicity of the overall population would remain basically the same. Ethnicity is a social construct, and if the immigrants became culturally integrated into the native culture, that would not change the ethnicity of the overall population. Race, on the other hand, is determined by biological and genetic factors. Racial composition may or may not change with an immigrant group, depending on the biological makeup of the original and immigrant groups.

45. The correct answer is B. Latino individuals are as likely as white individuals to have access to minimally adequate mental health treatment post diagnosis. While Latino individuals are less likely than whites to be diagnosed with mental illness, they are as likely to receive minimally adequate treatment post diagnosis. Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 1 46. The correct answer is B. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) who have mental health difficulties have fewer financial resources and less access to mental health care, and are therefore less able to seek treatment. The culture of poverty theory would ignore the reduced access to mental health treatment and attribute George's problems to his poor choices related to drug use. This scenario speaks against social mobility rather than describes it. Human capital does not apply because George has the education to improve his SES.

47. The correct answer is B. As a young person with no financial resources, George has less access to mental health care. Additionally, now that he is no longer a student, he likely does not have access to the student counseling center at his school.

48. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Both the stigma related to seeking mental health care and the lack of mental health providers in lower SES areas are likely to affect George's ability to receive treatment.

49. The correct answer is A. While black individuals are the least likely to receive a mental health diagnosis, they also have the least access to minimally adequate mental health treatment and are the least likely to receive treatment once diagnosed.

Passage $\mathrm{X}$ 50. The correct answer is A. Bodily resources are mobilized and metabolism speeds up. During the alarm stage people experience increased physiological arousal. They will become anxious and frightened. The response is similar to the fightor-flight syndrome.

51. The correct answer is D. Resistance; the reaction can persist for hours, days, or years. In GAS, people experiencing resistance generally have a negative emotional and physical reaction (e.g., being tired, irritable, impatient, and angry). However, they are able to intentionally engage in adaptive stress management activities (meditation, seeking social support) to reduce the negative impact of stress. Exhaustion is characterized by extreme physical and mental fatigue. However, it is also characterized by the lack of ability to engage in adaptive stress management activities to resist stress.

52. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Resistance reactions are adaptive and can help reduce the impact of stress. This is consistent with GAS theory. Resistance reactions are those activities that the individual uses to resist the negative impact of stress on the mind and body in order to reduce the likelihood of entering the exhaustion stage.

53. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Multiple simultaneous stressors may overwhelm an individual's stress resistance activities and push him or her into the exhaustion stage more quickly. Individuals are able to resist stress until it overwhelms their adaptive resistance activities, after which the individual falls into exhaustion. Multiple simultaneous moderately stressful events will impact the efficacy of stress resistance activities and push the individual into the exhaustion stage faster than only a single stressor of moderate severity. 54. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. Jeremy reacted by adapting and making behavioral changes in response to the stressful situation in an attempt to reduce the stress. This is a characteristic of a resistance reaction.

55. The correct answer is C. The forgetting curve is characterized by an initial rapid decrease in the proportion remembered, followed by a slow flattening out over time.

56. The correct answer is D. Based on the forgetting curve, each relearning episode increases the amount retained over time. Recall is better for the first few days with each relearning episode.

57. The correct answer is D. Relearning impacts the rate of forgetting only after several relearning episodes. In the graph, relearning impacts the rate of forgetting as early as the first relearning episode, although repeated relearning episodes slow the rate of forgetting. Even in the context of multiple relearning episodes, forgetting does still occur over time, but repetition slows this rate of loss.

58. The correct answer is A. Test performance would decline sharply at first but decline less and less in later years. There is no relearning in this scenario and the results would be consistent with the slope of the forgetting curve.

59. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. There would be a significant decline in your memory in the first week, but the decline would become less abrupt after each time that you studied the list. Each relearning interval will increase the amount retained on subsequent tests. Answers and Explanations

Passage XI MCAT

Passage I

\section{Section 4. Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills}

1. The correct answer is $D$. The woolly flying squirrel did not really vanish; salajit collectors knew of its existence. Choices A, B, and C are supported by information in the passage.

2. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Zahler chooses not to track the aquatic genet because he prefers to look for a creature that does not live in a tropical biome. There is no support for the notion that tropical diseases affect these mammals (choice D). The other two choices may or may not be true, but they are not supported by the author's mention of the aquatic genet in the article.

3. The correct answer is D. Paragraph 1 gives MacKinnon's requirements for rediscovery or discovery of species. The woolly flying squirrel's home in caves in the Himalayas certainly meets the requirement for isolation (choice A), but as paragraph 4 points out, it also meets the requirements for geographic and climatic stability, making choice $\mathrm{D}$ the correct answer.

4. The correct answer is $B$. The discussion of how Zahler chose this animal to study appears in paragraph 3. He wanted a mammal that was not too small, relatively unknown, and in need of conservation intervention. Because he did not wish to deal with heat or diseases, he passed up the aquatic genet for the woolly flying squirrel. That makes choice $B$ the best answer.

5. The correct answer is A. To answer this question, you must apply MacKinnon's requirements to your knowledge of geography. MacKinnon suggests that dry climates are not conducive to rediscovery, making the Sahara an unlikely answer (choice D). Western Iran is prone to earthquake activity, making it a less likely choice than the more remote, steamy jungles of Borneo. Choice A is the best answer.

6. The correct answer is A. Information that weakens the argument will argue against rediscovery's being a way to protect species. Of the information given, choices B, C, and D suggest ways that species are being protected. Only choice A mentions something that might actually harm a rediscovered species.

Passage II 7. The correct answer is D. Both the Beat and the Lost Generations came of age during war and found it hard to cope in the postwar world. Both tended toward exile and alienation, making choice $\mathrm{D}$ the best answer.

8. The correct answer is C. The word culture is used twice-to refer to "the drug culture" and to "sixties culture." Choices A, B, and D make no sense in this context, so the only possible connotation is choice C.

9. The correct answer is B. According to the author, "the trials loosened some of the definitions that had bound American literature." The trials, then, did not affect the movement of the Beats (choice A) or their influences (choice C); they affected modern definitions of literature (choice B).

10. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. To answer this question correctly, you must ask yourself, "Is there at least one example of I, II, or III anywhere in the passage?" Statement I says that Kerouac continued to write before his On the Road was published, but there are no examples of what he wrote. Statement III says that the Beats influenced sixties culture, but there are no examples of works from that era that showed the Beats' influence. Statement II says that the drug culture affected some Beats. The author gives the example of Burroughs, who wrote Junkie about his own addiction, and also mentions "Howl" and its emphasis on drug culture. Because only statement II has supporting examples, the only correct response is (choice B).

11. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. It is the subject matter, not the form of Corso's poetry that ties it to the angst of a postwar generation. Including "Bomb" in the passage would help support the point made in choice C.

12. The correct answer is D. If the Beats were omitted from an important anthology, it could only indicate that they were not considered important enough to include. That would negate choice $\mathrm{D}$, the notion that they transcended their time. It would not say anything about choice A or C, and the fact that Beat writing was difficult (choice B) would not be enough to eliminate it from an anthology.

13. The correct answer is C. Refining is one of the three steps in the creation of aluminum. It involves the separation of a solution through distillation and addition of chemicals. Although refined is a multiple-meaning word that in context may have any of the four definitions listed, only choice $\mathrm{C}$ works in the context of this passage.

14. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is true, but it has nothing to do with the protests. There is no evidence to support choice D. Choice C may or may not be true; it is implied, but it is not a major point. The mention of protests mainly indicates choice B, that workers are beginning to question the dangers of mining.

15. The correct answer is A. There is nothing to support choice B or C, and the author is completely objective when it comes to the discussion of Karl Bayer (choice D). In the final paragraph, the author states, "As with all mining of metals, bauxite mining presents certain hazards," indicating that choice A is the best answer.

16. The correct answer is C. Paragraph 6 describes the process of refinement and its by-products. Those that are mentioned in the paragraph include choices A, B, and D. There is no mention of choice C, which is an alloy of aluminum and an element not involved in this refining process.

17. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. According to paragraph 2, the most commonly mined form of bauxite is gibbsite, a trihydrate form of bauxite. If it is trihydrate, then it contains three molecules of water (choice D). There is no evidence in the passage to support any of the other choices.

18. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The three-step process that produces aluminum is described as involving mining, refining, and smelting. It is typical of the process that results in most metal products that we use, so it is parallel to copper production (choice B). None of the other three products results from the same three-step process. Answers and Explanations Passage III MCAT

Practice Test 1

Passage IV 19. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The final paragraph mentions Bowdler's works other than Shakespeare and discusses the fact that we derive a verb from his name. The main idea of the paragraph, however, is that Bowdler's form of editing continues to the present day (choice C); several examples of present-day bowdlerization are given.

20. The correct answer is B. Bowdler himself was trained as a doctor; the passage makes clear that he was not an editor. His sister, however, was a poet and editor, and therefore was more likely than he to have made the editorial changes that led to the revised Shakespearean texts. There is no evidence in the passage to support choice $\mathrm{C}$ or $\mathrm{D}$, and although there is some implication that choice $\mathrm{A}$ is true, it does not explain why she would have been a more likely editor than he.

21. The correct answer is A. There is no mention of a dream (choice D), the poet laureate is used as an example of prior editing but not as an inspiration for Bowdler himself (choice C), and Bowdler was not a scholar, making choice B an unlikely answer. Instead, his desire was to make Shakespeare accessible to children, and in its unexpurgated state, he felt that was impossible. Choice A is the best answer.

22. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Look for the answer that is supported by the text. Although choices A, B, and C may in fact be true, none of them receives support in the passage. The author's reason for including mention of Nehum Tate is to show that the Bowdlers were not the first to edit Shakespeare.

23. The correct answer is C. Remember that the answer will NOT be an example of bowdlerization. First, you must find the definition of bowdlerization in the text: "to censor or amend a written work, often with a connotation of prudishness." Item I is not an example of this; simply translating from one language to another requires neither censorship or amendment. Item III is not an example either; although some may say that book burning is a radical form of censorship, it does not fit the definition here. Only II, which deals with the censorship of a detail in a text, fits the definition. Since I and III do not, choice $\mathrm{C}$ is the correct answer.

24. The correct answer is A. Although choices B, C, and D appear in the passage, none of them supports the claim that Bowdler's revised Shakespeare was not universally despised. The quote from Swinburne (choice A), however, does-Swinburne praises Bowdler for creating a Shakespeare that can be put in the hands of children.

25. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Because the author makes the point that bowdlerization still occurs today, it is not likely that everyone would revile such a text (choice B) or see that it failed (choice D). More likely would be that it would receive some condemnation but also make some sales (choice A). Although a point is made about "dumbing down" texts for high school students (choice C), the author does not appear to support this, nor is it proof that students would not understand the bowdlerized Shakespeare.

Passage V 26. The correct answer is B. “The Red Cross, yes, but Henry Kissinger?" asks the author. The author finds the controversy over Rigoberta "surprising" and states, "her place in the history of Central American peasant revolutions seems assured." That indicates that as far as the author is concerned, the committee's choice of Rigoberta is not undeserved (I), but the choice of Kissinger may well be (II). Since the author gives the Red Cross (III) a thumbs-up, only choice B fits the passage.

27. The correct answer is C. For vocabulary-in-context questions like this one, always locate the word in question because the distracters are likely to be alternate meanings of that word. Here, the passage states, "Rigoberta's father was taken into custody and tortured when the army believed he had assisted in the assassination of a plantation owner." The only answer that makes sense in this context is choice $\mathrm{C}$.

28. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The question asks you to find the one or more statements that do NOT support the premise that Rigoberta falsified her book. To do that, you must find the statements that do support that premise and eliminate those. Statements that do support the premise will indicate some kind of disconnect between what she said and what was true. Those statements include I and II. Statement III, on the other hand, is simply a statement of fact. It does not support the premise that she falsified the book. The answer is choice C.

29. The correct answer is B. This question calls for a cause-and-effect relationship. You must find the cause of Rigoberta's departure. That is not simply something that happened before her departure (choice D), or something that was true but not a direct cause (choice A). The cause appears in the sentence "Soon Rigoberta was herself a target." She left because otherwise she might have been assassinated (choice B).

30. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question is purely speculative, since the author did not include information to support the statement. If the author had, it would have had to be information that told more about the teaching of Rigoberta's book in schools. Two students' comments (choice A) would not be enough evidence, and choices B and C might show that the book is still sold but not that it is widely taught. Only choice D includes reasonable evidence.

31. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. You are asked here to assess the relative relevance of evidence. Falsifying a birth date (choice A) might be evidence of a minor deception, but it would not be enough to support charges of fraud. Falsifying a critical part of her history as it relates to her reputation, as choice C would do, would certainly indicate a desire to deceive.

32. The correct answer is A. David Stoll objects to what he considers Rigoberta's misleading the public on matters of fact. That would not mean that her work was an epic (choice B) or a folktale (choice C) because those are specific genres of literature that do not fit his accusations. Nor would he call her work a manifesto (choice D) because he does not accept her as a leader. He might, however, use the trendy word truthiness to describe what he feels to be a bending of the truth. Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 1 33. The correct answer is $C$. To answer this kind of question, you must compare what you know about the author's point of view with the choices given. The author, unlike some of the people in the passage, seems to have a positive view of Rigoberta, as evinced in the line, "her place in the history of Central American peasant revolutions seems assured." That means that choices A and B would be unlikely views of this author, and there is no evidence to support choice D one way or the other. The best answer is choice C.

Passage VI 34. The correct answer is D. The author finds that metanarratives are often racist, sexist, or classist; but that mininarratives are often too restrictive or exclusive to be useful. The best answer is choice D.

35. The correct answer is C. You must make this prediction based on what the author has said in the passage. Two examples of courses in American history are given to support the notion that some mininarratives are incompatible, but there is no indication that offering more courses would help (choice A). The author mentions revising the canon (choice B) in paragraphs 4 and 5 but implies that it was a good and necessary idea. Red states and blue states are mentioned in passing, but there is little else to indicate the author's feelings about politics (choice D). The best answer is choice $C$; the author is concerned that students today find it hard to see a "big picture" due to their immersion in competing mininarratives.

36. The correct answer is D. Supposition I is supported by the examples of competing American history courses. Supposition II is supported by the clash between evolutionary theory and strict Bible interpretation. Supposition III is supported by the example of a Eurocentric look at American history (see paragraph 2). Since all three suppositions are supported by examples, choice $\mathrm{D}$ is the best answer.

37. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The main idea of the passage has to do with the tension between metanarratives and mininarratives, especially as they affect the way we learn things. This would be most useful for people who develop curricula.

38. The correct answer is B. Smorgasbord is a Swedish word meaning "a buffet meal featuring a variety of dishes." It is this variety, or choice, to which the author refers. Even if you do not know the word, you should be able to guess this from context.

39. The correct answer is D. All three philosophies are all-encompassing ways to look at the world, so all three could be considered metanarratives. Since all three are valid, the answer is choice $\mathrm{D}$.

40. The correct answer is A. A mininarrative looks at the world through a limited lens. A metanarrative provides more of a big picture. The best analogy is choice A.

Passage VII 41. The correct answer is C. This question asks you to find the main idea. To find the main idea, you must read actively and summarize as you go. There are no titles on MCAT passages to reveal the central thesis, so you must derive it from the text. To determine the correct answer, review the choices. You need to select the one that is not only true according to the passage, but also not so specific that it excludes one or more of the author's main points. The author indicates that millions of people are blogging but does not mention how many people read popular blogs. Therefore choice A is not supported by the text and can be eliminated. Similarly, the author notes that advertisers are spending more money on blogs than they have in the past but does not reveal that traditional print and broadcasting outlets are receiving less money (choice B). While choice D is true according to the passage, it is not general enough to be the central thesis. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is the correct response, echoing the general statement made at the beginning of the passage, and being broad enough to encompass the author's points made throughout the text.

42. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question asks you to draw conclusions about a fact presented in the passage. It is a skill most often applied to fiction, but it works in this case for nonfiction as well. The word implies tells you that the answer is not directly stated. It is up to you to return to the passage and make inferences based on what is written. The passage states that popular bloggers are the ones making money from advertising. There is no general information given about what makes a blog popular; one blogger earns money from humor, while another presents controversial political discourse. There is nothing in the passage to suggest that content about celebrities equates with popularity, eliminating choice C. There is also no reason given to infer that bloggers are, or should be, appealing to marketers (choice D). Although there is one example of a popular blog that is controversial, the other example regarding a humorous website makes choice B the correct answer. Marketers want to advertise on sites that are read by many people, regardless of content.

43. The correct answer is A. You must apply new evidence to an assertion in the passage for this question. Specifically, what fact presented by the author would be challenged by evidence that traditional media sources were successfully competing for blogs' advertising revenue? Choices $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ are true statements according to the passage, but they do not relate to the new evidence and should be eliminated. There is nothing in the passage to suggest that blogs are better at disseminating information, so choice C should also be eliminated. A careful rereading of the final paragraph reveals that marketers spend money on blogs and other online advertising because they want "new and more effective ways to reach consumers." Therefore, choice A is correct.

44. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question involves analyzing an argument. The assertion that blogs influence language (I) is supported by the example of a dictionary giving the distinction of "word of the year" to blog. There is no example given of politicians using blogs for any reason (II). Since the assertion that blogs include otherwise neglected news (III) is supported by the story about Trent Lott, both I and III are true, and choice $C$ is correct. Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 1 45. The correct answer is C. This question tests your ability to locate supporting details or evidence. In questions of this kind, everything you need to know is found directly in the text. The last line of paragraph 2 contains the information: "When those passive consumers use simple websites to disseminate facts and ideas of their choosing, they evolve from passive consumers to active participants, effectively blurring the line between the media and its audience." There is nothing in the passage to suggest that the advertising revenue diverted to blogs is changing the nature of the media (choice A). While the passage does present evidence that blogs can affect political careers (choice B) and they are a public display of ideas (choice D), this evidence is not related to a change in the nature of the media. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is the only correct response.

46. The correct answer is D. For questions such as this one, you must draw a conclusion by going beyond the facts of the passage to determine the correct answer. The coverage of Senator Lott is an example of the expansion of what is considered to be newsworthy, not an example of how blogs are attracting advertisers and their money (choice A). There is no suggestion that the coverage was designed to do anything other than report on the news, so choice B is also incorrect. Since Lott resigned from his position as Speaker of the House, the story was not ineffective, eliminating choice C. Choice D is the correct answer because paragraph 3 clearly states that traditional media sources often don't cover what they deem to be controversial news stories, "virtually ignoring" Lott's remarks.

Passage VIII 47. The correct answer is A. This evaluation question asks you to analyze an argument. Specifically, you need to figure out why the author mentioned the Platonic tradition. In the first paragraph, the author states that the prevailing view of mathematics is an "easy" one that may be "cemented" in the minds of people. Later, in the third paragraph, the author states that the new view of mathematics has met with "stiff resistance." Thus, the mention of the Platonic tradition helps to explain why there is resistance to the conclusions of the new paradigm, which is what choice A says.

48. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. To answer this question, you must assess evidence. Since this is an EXCEPT question, you're looking for the choice that is not present in the passage. The passage does discuss experiments, choice $\mathrm{A}$, in the section about violation of expectation tests. The part about the $\mathrm{PhD}$ in chemistry who suffered from acalculia is a case study (choice B). Finally, the author presents a comparison (choice D) when showing how animals and humans have similar abilities. That leaves choice $\mathrm{C}$ as the correct answer.

49. The correct answer is $D$. This question asks you to draw conclusions about an assertion that is not directly stated. The second paragraph states that mathematics is created by man, which implies that mathematical concepts are to some degree arbitrary. Choice A is contradicted by the passage in the final paragraph when the author says that the acalculia patient "has no problem manipulating abstract algebraic operations." Choice B is not supported because the passage only mentions that some animals have mathematical abilities. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect; infants at the age of a few months can perform simple calculations. At younger ages they can only differentiate between two and three items.

50. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question involves interpreting vocabulary. The word curious appears in the final passage. In that paragraph, the author discusses "anomalous" cases and describes the situation as "strange." This makes choice C, "odd," the best choice. There is no indication that the author thinks the fact is superb or excellent ("marvelous," choice A), of foreign origin ("exotic," choice B), or new ("novel," choice D).

51. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. In order to answer this question, you must be able to judge credibility. The author cites the violation of expectation experiment as support for the author's claim that mathematics is an innate part of human cognition. In order for these experiments to be credible, the author is assuming that the researchers can accurately determine that the infants are in fact surprised when the number of puppets changes. The only evidence for this is the direction and duration of the stares of the subjects. Accepting these results as evidence indicates the author believes outward signs accurately indicate inner emotional states; otherwise, the evidence would not support the argument.

52. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question requires you to find the main idea. The passage states that a longstanding view of mathematics as an objective reality is being challenged by new evidence in the fields of cognitive science and developmental psychology. This is what choice $C$ expresses. Choice $A$ is incorrect because the main idea of the passage does not concern Western philosophers. The passage does not claim that animals have the same mathematical abilities as humans do, making choice B wrong. Choice D is not supported by the passage at all.

53. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question asks you to apply new evidence. This question is very difficult because you must understand both the nature of the author's argument and the effect of new evidence on it. The passage argues that mathematical thinking is a product of the innate structures of the brain and mathematical "truths" are created by people. Finding a group of people that lacks mathematical ability might seem to refute the argument as choice A indicates, but upon closer examination it is not the best answer. The author does allow that certain changes in the brain may destroy the ability to perform mathematical operations. Thus, the community of math-deficient people may have a genetic mutation that prevents them from doing math. If so, it would not harm the author's argument. If, however, the group had no brain abnormalities and possessed no mathematical abilities, it would challenge the author's belief that mathematical thought is hardwired into the brain. Thus, choice $\mathrm{D}$ is the best answer. Answers and Explanations
