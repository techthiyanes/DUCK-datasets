Most leukemia cases involve elevated leukocyte counts. In acute cases of leukemia, immature leukocytes proliferate quickly, which leads to many abnormal immature cells in the bone marrow. This inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce healthy new leukocytes. This form of the cancer progresses rapidly, and the cells metastasize easily as they move into the bloodstream from the bone marrow. It can be fatal within weeks or months if not treated promptly. In contrast, chronic cases of leukemia typically involve the proliferation of abnormal mature leukocytes. This form of the disease progresses more slowly, and treatment need not always be immediate.\n\nOnce classified as acute or chronic, leukemia can be further subdivided into lymphocytic or myelogenous.

Chronic cases involve types of leukocytes that have less important functions in the body.\n\nB. Chronic cases of leukemia involve abnormal cell division of mature cells, so there are still some immature cells that can proliferate into normal mature cells.\n\nC.

Electrolytes such as sodium are drawn out of the cells in an attempt to equilibrate the concentrations inside and outside of the cells. As more and more water enters the extracellular fluids, the plasma sodium concentration drops, leading to a condition called hyponatremia, defined as a plasma sodium concentration less than $130 \\mathrm{mmol} \/$ liter. Due to the effects of osmosis, water begins entering the cells. The cells will begin to swell and may eventually burst, if the condition is not reversed in a timely manner.\n\nThe situation becomes increasingly problematic as the cells and tissues of the central nervous system take in more water. Pressure builds in the brain that causes symptoms that resemble alcohol intoxication. Lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, and headaches are typical as well. Damage can also occur in the lungs and heart. If not treated promptly, seizures, coma, and death can occur within several hours. SECTION 1:\n\nBiological and\n\nBiochemical Foundations of Living Systems MCAT\n12.

To answer this question, Answers and Explanations Passage III MCAT\n\nyou need to think about how the sperm cells in the testes would compare to other cells in the body. Sperm cells are haploid, and all are genetically different from each other and from other cells in the body. Because they are genetically different, they should express unique surface antigens. If the cells of the immune system were to contact the sperm, they would be perceived as foreign and could be subject to immune system attack, which would destroy the sperm. For this reason, the blood-testis barrier is required to keep the sperm away from the immune cells. The remaining choices do not make good sense. Sperm cells will eventually leave the reproductive system during ejaculation. It also would not make sense to indicate that the blood flow to the testes needs to be cut off.

In order for apoptosis to initiate in osteoblasts, the enzyme capsase-8 must be activated. This enzyme serves as a protease that cleaves critical proteins in the cell, causing cell death. Capsase-8 is only expressed under certain circumstances. In the case of osteomyelitis, the S. aureus bacteria cause the induction of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in the osteoblasts. Then TRAIL activates capsase-8, which triggers a series of events leading to apoptosis and death of osteoblasts.\n22. Many strains of $S$. aureus that cause osteomyelitis are termed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These strains have developed resistance to the antibiotic methicillin as well as to other antibiotics. The mechanism by which this antibiotic resistance occurs is by:\n\nA. the overuse of antibiotics, which causes patients to become resistant to the antibiotics\n\nB. the overuse of antibiotics, which selects for bacteria that have mutations that allow them to survive in the presence of the antibiotics\n\nC. mutations, which occur as the bacteria are exposed to antibiotics that can serve as mutagens\n\nD. all of the above",

        "Solution": "22. The correct answer is $\\mathrm{B}$. Bacteria spontaneously mutate in order to produce diversity in the population. Some bacteria have spontaneous mutations, usually on plasmids, that allow them to survive in the presence of certain antibiotics. If the bacterial population is repeatedly exposed to that antibiotic due to overuse, it exerts selective pressure where only the resistant bacteria survive. These resistant bacteria multiply, and in the next generation a higher frequency of resistance is observed. Antibiotic resistance has nothing to do with people becoming resistant to antibiotics-it is all about the bacterial mutations.",

Blood from the right atrium passes through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle and then leaves the heart through the pulmonary semilunar valve. Blood is carried via the pulmonary arteries to the lungs where gas exchange occurs. After gas exchange occurs, oxygenated blood returns to the heart via pulmonary veins to enter the left atrium. From there blood passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle. Blood leaves the left side of the heart by passing through the aortic valve into the aorta.

When the nephrons absorb more water to increase blood volume, the urine volume decreases. The two hormones aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone help increase the amount of water reabsorbed by nephrons, which in turn decreases urine volume. In order to reduce blood pressure, the kidneys can decrease the amount of water reabsorbed by the nephrons. The less water reabsorbed means there will be less blood volume and less blood pressure.

This question requires you to know some of the details of the female reproductive cycle including what hormones are involved following ovulation. Prior to ovulation, both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary and are involved in follicular growth and maturation. The secretion of both FSH and LH is stimulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone $(\\mathrm{GnRH})$ from the hypothalamus. As the follicles grow and mature, they produce estrogen. During the second week of the cycle, increasing estrogen levels cause a spike in LH levels, which causes ovulation. Recall that following ovulation, the remnant of the follicle that stays in the Answers and Explanations Passage VI Passage VII MCAT\n\novary is called the corpus luteum.

The best explanation for why two phenotypes (complete protection and partial protection) are observed would be that the delta-32 allele exhibits incomplete dominance. An individual that is homozygous for the allele (meaning he or she inherited two copies of the delta-32 allele) would have full protection, while an individual who is heterozygous (meaning he or she has one normal copy of the allele and one copy of the delta-32 allele) would have an intermediate phenotype (being partial protection).

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are frequently caused by $E$. coli that exist as harmless residents in the intestinal tract. These infections can be treated using antibiotics to kill the E. coli. However, about 30 percent of women treated for UTIs end up with a recurrence. For those who support the VBNC theory, it has been hypothesized that recurrent UTIs are caused by VBNC E. coli that resuscitate to initiate a new infection. These VBNC cells may not be killed using antibiotic therapies normally used to treat UTIs. Only culturable cells cause the symptoms of a UTI.\n\nThe following graph shows the number of E. coli bacteria present in a patient following antibiotic therapy for a UTI. Day 1 indicates the number of bacteria present at diagnosis. A urine sample was collected each day and cultured for the presence of E. coli as measured in colony-forming units per milliliter of urine (cfu\/ml). An assay was also used to determine the number of metabolically active cells that were potentially alive but not culturable (VBNC). The data are as follows:\n\n43.

Since the question is asking about nonsteroid, or peptide, hormones, choices A and B can be eliminated. Choice D can also be eliminated as this is not a plausible explanation. Nonsteroid hormones act as first messengers, binding to their receptors on the Answers and Explanations MCAT\n\ncell membrane. The hormone itself does not enter the cell. The binding of the first messenger to the receptor causes a series of reactions in the cell that ultimately activate second messengers, such as cAMP.",

The physics involved in these devices are based on Newton's second law of motion and Atwood's machine.\n\n\nNewton's second law of motion states that a net force, $F_{\\text {net, }}$, acting in a given direction on an object of mass, $m$, will result in an acceleration, $a$, of the object in that same direction, i.e.:\n\n$$\n\\sum F=m a\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\sum F_{x}=m a_{x} \\text { and } \\sum F_{y}=m a_{y}\n$$\n\nAtwood's machine, illustrated in the following figure, uses a block-and-pulley system to determine the acceleration of the system as well as other variables such as the falling distance of either mass and the tension in the string connecting the masses.\n\n\nIn a typical experimental setup, the Atwood machine is assembled with a massless string around a pulley. Connected on either end of the string are two masses, $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, where $m_{1} \\neq m_{2}$. The pulley is considered to be massless as well as frictionless. When the connected masses are released, both masses will accelerate at the same rate with the larger mass accelerating downward and the smaller mass accelerating upward.\n\nStudents were asked to conduct experiments using Atwood's machine with a constant total mass of $300 \\mathrm{~g}$. They were given hanging weights in increments of $10 \\mathrm{~g}$ and could place any number of weights on either side of Atwood's machine as long as the total mass equaled $300 \\mathrm{~g}$. SECTION 2:\n\nChemical and\n\nPhysical\n\nFoundations of Biological Systems MCAT\n42. In an experiment using a pulley with friction, the students collect data and create a graph of acceleration versus mass difference. From the graph, the students can determine the frictional force from the:\nA. $x$-variable\nB. $y$-variable\nC. slope\nD. $y$-intercept",

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 15-19 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage III\n\nResearchers studying vision use various methods to investigate human perceptual experience. Research on spectral sensitivity of the rod receptors (scattered throughout the retina) and cone visual receptors (mainly concentrated in the fovea area of the retina) highlights the relationship between perception and physiology.\n\nSignal detection methods have been used to measure the differences in how perception adjusts to low-light environments. Participant responses can be plotted based on sensitivity versus length of time in the dark. The dark adaptation curve can be plotted showing how rods and cones differ in their sensitivity to light over time.\n\nThe following graph shows a plot of three calculated dark adaptation curves. SECTION 3:\n\nPsychological,\n\nSocial, and\n\nBiological\n\nFoundations of Behavior \n\n\nThree dark adaptation curves. Both dashed lines indicate receptor-specific curves, while the solid line is a plot of human light sensitivity with both receptor types included.\n19. Based on the research described above and the physiology of the eye, what is the MOST likely explanation for increased rod sensitivity after the rod-cone break?\nA. Cones are poorer at light adaptation because large groups of them are con- nected to one interneuron.\nB. Cones are better at light adaptation because they respond to specific wave- lengths of light.\nC. Rods are poorer at light adaptation because they are less prone to pigment bleaching.\nD. Rods are better at light adaptation because large groups of them are connected to one interneuron.",

        "Solution": "29. The correct answer is A. The more stress to which a person who is genetically predisposed to schizophrenia is exposed, the greater the likelihood that person will experience a psychotic break. The vulnerability-stress view suggests that environmental stressors are correlated to the expression of schizophrenic symptoms. As these stressors increase, the likelihood increases that a person biologically predisposed to schizophrenia will exhibit symptoms. The research is still ongoing with regard to answer $\\mathrm{C}$ and the vulnerability-stress model does not currently recognize differences in positive and negative stress. Answer $\\mathrm{D}$ would require the individual to experience stress along with the biological family to fulfill the requirements of the model. If the individual was adopted and has no contact with the biological family, the biological family's stress will not trigger a schizophrenic break.\n\nPassage VI",

In a classic series of studies, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus investigated the storage and recall of information in memory. Based on his findings, he developed the so-called forgetting curve, a way of illustrating the rate at which people forget the information they have learned. The forgetting curve has been studied in a variety of different environments and for a variety of different stimuli.\n\nOn day 1 of a memory research study, participants were asked to learn a list of items. Researchers then tracked the proportion of the list that the participants remembered as time passed. On day 2 , some participants were asked to relearn the list. Again, the proportion remembered was tracked over time. On day 3 , some participants were asked to relearn the list a second time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time. On day 4, some participants were asked to relearn the list a third time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time.\n\nThe data from this study produced the following set of forgetting curves. Each line represents the memory of the learned or relearned list. The proportion of the list remembered is shown on the $y$-axis (memory), and the time interval for forgetting is shown on the $x$-axis (time remembered in days).\n\n\nForgetting curves.

First, scientists should look in areas that are geologically stable. Areas with regular earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are less likely to contain species that go back thousands of years because, obviously, the frequent upheavals are not conducive to steady growth or a comfortable way of life. Second, scientists are most likely to find undiscovered or rediscovered species in remote, isolated areas. Cultivated areas are inhospitable to many animals. Often, cultivation eliminates the trees or shrubs that house and protect animal life. A stable climate is a third thing to look for. Stability of climate ensures that the animals that live in the region have had no reason to leave for warmer or wetter environments.\n\nAlthough most of the recent discoveries and rediscoveries of animal species have taken place in tropical, humid regions, some have occurred in rarely explored mountain habitats. A fourth key thing scientists should look for, according to MacKinnon, is an area with a variety of unusual species that are specific to that area. Of course, this requirement refers back to requirement number two, isolation. An area that is very isolated or difficult to access will naturally have species that cannot be found anywhere else.\n\nIn 1994 American biologist Peter Zahler took his second trip to the isolated valleys of the Diamer region in northern Pakistan. He was searching for the woolly flying squirrel, a dog-sized squirrel last seen in 1924. As he describes it, he had narrowed down his search to two animals, using the criteria mammal, not too small, relatively unknown, and in need of conservation intervention. Because he did not wish to spend time in the steamy environment of the Congo basin, he eliminated the aquatic genet \nthe squirrel. Many recalled hearing tales about the strange animal, but all insisted it was extinct.\n\nZahler continued to set traps, listen to squirrel legends, and ask questions. He dodged avalanches, skirted valleys patrolled by armed warlords, and crossed mountains on narrow goat paths. Policemen told him that the squirrels indeed existed in caves above the valley, and that they excreted a substance, salajit, that was used as an aphrodisiac. One day, two large, machine gun-toting men entered his camp. After some small talk, one asked whether he would be willing to pay for a live squirrel. The pair claimed to be salajit collectors. Zahler agreed to pay top dollar, never envisioning that 2 hours later, he would be presented with a woolly flying squirrel in a bag. Following that surprise, Zahler located evidence of live squirrels throughout the region. The squirrel certainly obeyed all of MacKinnon's regulations. Despite frequent avalanches, the Himalayas are a geologically stable area with a harsh but stable climate and a number of rare species. Not only were the squirrels' caves remote and isolated, it was often necessary to rappel down or climb up sheer cliffs to reach them.\n\nEach rediscovery gives scientists a vital second chance to protect and preserve our rarest, most fragile species. With scientists and students from Pakistan, Zahler began work on a program to protect the squirrel's habitat. Only the advent of war in Afghanistan forced him to abandon the area, and he remains connected to scientists in Pakistan who are continuing the effort.\n1.

MacKinnon suggests that dry climates are not conducive to rediscovery, making the Sahara an unlikely answer (choice D).

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 1-6 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage I\n\nAccording to Professor John MacKinnon, certain places are more likely than others to house new or rediscovered species. First, scientists should look in areas that are geologically stable. Areas with regular earthquakes or volcanic eruptions are less likely to contain species that go back thousands of years because, obviously, the frequent upheavals are not conducive to steady growth or a comfortable way of life. Second, scientists are most likely to find undiscovered or rediscovered species in remote, isolated areas. Cultivated areas are inhospitable to many animals. Often, cultivation eliminates the trees or shrubs that house and protect animal life. A stable climate is a third thing to look for. Stability of climate ensures that the animals that live in the region have had no reason to leave for warmer or wetter environments.\n\nAlthough most of the recent discoveries and rediscoveries of animal species have taken place in tropical, humid regions, some have occurred in rarely explored mountain habitats. A fourth key thing scientists should look for, according to MacKinnon, is an area with a variety of unusual species that are specific to that area. Of course, this requirement refers back to requirement number two, isolation. An area that is very isolated or difficult to access will naturally have species that cannot be found anywhere else.\n\nIn 1994 American biologist Peter Zahler took his second trip to the isolated valleys of the Diamer region in northern Pakistan. He was searching for the woolly flying squirrel, a dog-sized squirrel last seen in 1924. As he describes it, he had narrowed down his search to two animals, using the criteria mammal, not too small, relatively unknown, and in need of conservation intervention. Because he did not wish to spend time in the steamy environment of the Congo basin, he eliminated the aquatic genet \nthe squirrel. Many recalled hearing tales about the strange animal, but all insisted it was extinct.\n\nZahler continued to set traps, listen to squirrel legends, and ask questions. He dodged avalanches, skirted valleys patrolled by armed warlords, and crossed mountains on narrow goat paths. Policemen told him that the squirrels indeed existed in caves above the valley, and that they excreted a substance, salajit, that was used as an aphrodisiac. One day, two large, machine gun-toting men entered his camp. After some small talk, one asked whether he would be willing to pay for a live squirrel. The pair claimed to be salajit collectors. Zahler agreed to pay top dollar, never envisioning that 2 hours later, he would be presented with a woolly flying squirrel in a bag. Following that surprise, Zahler located evidence of live squirrels throughout the region. The squirrel certainly obeyed all of MacKinnon's regulations. Despite frequent avalanches, the Himalayas are a geologically stable area with a harsh but stable climate and a number of rare species. Not only were the squirrels' caves remote and isolated, it was often necessary to rappel down or climb up sheer cliffs to reach them.\n\nEach rediscovery gives scientists a vital second chance to protect and preserve our rarest, most fragile species. With scientists and students from Pakistan, Zahler began work on a program to protect the squirrel's habitat. Only the advent of war in Afghanistan forced him to abandon the area, and he remains connected to scientists in Pakistan who are continuing the effort.\n6. According to the author, rediscovery gives scientists a second chance to protect and preserve rare species. Which of the following information, if true, would most WEAKEN this argument?\nA. Ornithologists hoping for a second sighting of the long-lost ivory-billed wood- pecker have triggered a stampede of cameras and news media to the fragile forests where it was recently spotted.\nB. The Audubon Society has set aside part of a forest on Oahu as a potential breeding ground for an endangered warbler once common on several of the Hawaiian islands.\nC. The northern hairy-nosed wombat lives only in one known area, a protected section of Epping Forest National Park in central Queensland, Australia.\nD. Rodent control programs on the Galapagos Islands have managed to stem a threat to endangered petrels, and now 90 percent of their nests result in a successful hatching out of eggs.",

At that time, the Beats were in their infancy. In the early '40s, Kerouac attended Columbia University on a football scholarship, but a leg injury ended his football career and forced him to drop out of school. His brief sojourn with the Merchant Marine and the Navy ended badly, and Kerouac limped back to New York to rejoin friends at Columbia, where he met student Allen Ginsberg and the older William S.

The following year, he traveled cross-country with his friend Neal Cassady, a trip that would inspire his most famous work, On the Road. Perhaps as much as any Beat work, this frenetic work illustrated the Beat dislike of conformity and desire for movement and new experiences.\n\nKerouac would continue to write prolifically in the 7 years it took to get On the Road published.

Red states and blue states are mentioned in passing, but there is little else to indicate the author's feelings about politics (choice D). The best answer is choice $C$; the author is concerned that students today find it hard to see a \"big picture\" due to their immersion in competing mininarratives.",

Suppose evidence was presented to show that traditional media sources were becoming successful in their attempts to compete for blogs' advertising revenue. This new information would MOST challenge the implication that:\nA. Advertisers are spending money on blogs because they present a more effective way to reach consumers.\nB. People choose to read blogs because they don't have to appeal to stockholders.\nC. Popular blogs are better at disseminating information than traditional media sources.\nD.

Study after study has shown that all people possess an innate arithmetic. Babies as young as three or four days old can differentiate between groups of two and three items. And by the age of four months or so, an infant can see that one plus one is two and two minus one is one. Researchers discovered this startling fact by means of a simple experiment, following what is known as the violation of expectation model in developmental psychology. An infant was presented with a scenario in which a researcher held a puppet before the baby's eyes. Then a screen was moved in front of the puppet and another researcher placed a second puppet behind it. The screen was removed and if there were two puppets now visible, the infant registered no surprise (as measured by both the direction of the child's gaze and the duration of her stare). But if the screen was removed and only one puppet appeared, the infant registered perplexity at the situation. This experiment and others like it strongly suggest that all individuals are born with certain mathematical concepts hardwired into their brains. The ability to quickly and accurately count a small number of items, called subitizing by psychologists, is also found in animals. Researchers using experiments similar to the violation of expectation setup described previously have found an innate mathematical ability not just in primates, our closest evolutionary cousins, but in raccoons, rats, parrots, and pigeons. These findings are consistent with the belief that mathematical thinking is a function of the structures in the brain and not a product of the outside world.\n\nAnomalous cases involving brain injuries and disorders also support the idea that mathematical thinking arises from the organization of the brain.

        "Solution": "7. The correct answer is D. Sex-linked inheritance can be quickly eliminated as males and females seem to be equally affected based on the pedigree. Since autosomal inheritance is obvious, it is necessary to determine if the pattern is characteristic of a dominant or recessive condition. Recessive traits are notorious for \"skipping generations\" in pedigrees, which means that affected children often come from unaffected parents. To be affected, the individual must be homozygous recessive. The parents do not have the disease, but they are unknowing carriers (heterozygotes), which gives them a $25 \\%$ chance of having an affected offspring. In dominant autosomal inheritance, the affected individual can be homozygous dominant or heterozygous. This means that in order for a child to have the disease, the child must have inherited at least one mutated allele from his or her parent who also had the disease. The only exception would be if spontaneous mutation occurred. When affected individuals appear in each generation of a pedigree, dominance should be suspected.",

Looking at the number of embryos surviving, you should notice that all three groups treated with any dosage of L-NAME had decreased survival as compared to the control group. The passage explains that L-NAME is a NOS inhibitor. If the enzyme needed to convert L-arginine to NO does not work, then NO levels will be decreased. The data suggest that a decreased level of $\\mathrm{NO}$ provided by the L-NAME treatment is detrimental. Further, the higher the dose of L-NAME, the more inhibition of NOS and the less NO provided, led to a dose dependent decrease in survival that eliminates choice $\\mathrm{C}$ as an option. The passage also explains that SNP is a NO donor, which increases NO levels. According to the data provided for the SNP groups, a small increase in NO (seen in group 2) seems to increase embryo survival. However, as the SNP dose becomes larger (and the higher the level of NO provided), this will lead to decreased survival. The highest rates of survival were seen in the $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SNP group, and survival decreased with increased dosage of SNP. This would eliminate choice B since increasing levels of NOS would increase NO levels similar to SNP treatment. The data show that SNP treatment (which increases NO levels) is most detrimental to embryo survival. Choice D directly contradicts this. The best conclusion is that $\\mathrm{NO}$ is necessary for development, since the data showed that the NO inhibition leads to decreased survival. However, only a certain amount of NO is needed as high levels also lead to decreased rates of embryo survival.",

An edible vaccine is a genetically modified organism (GMO) that is created when genes from the bacteria or virus being vaccinated against are inserted into plant cells. As the plants grow, they produce proteins from the bacteria or virus that the researchers are attempting to vaccinate against. When a person eats the plant, the viral or bacteria proteins serve as antigens, which initiates a primary immune response.\n\nSome of the plants that are of interest in edible vaccine development are bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, rice, tobacco, and soybeans. While early research focused on growing crops that produced edible products such as bananas, the most recent research is focused on extracting material from the leaves and seeds of the plants, dehydrating it, and putting it into capsules that can be swallowed. This allows for a more predictable dosage of the vaccine and eliminates concerns that the crops containing the vaccine would be accidentally eaten by individuals who are not in need of the vaccine. The term edible vaccine has now been replaced with the term plantderived oral vaccine.\n\nThe development of plant-derived oral vaccines solves many problems associated with injectable vaccines. Because plant-derived oral vaccines are grown in crops, there is no problem with storage or refrigeration that is required of most traditional vaccines. These plant-derived vaccines also require no special training to administer. Additionally, when a vaccine is taken orally, it provides mucosal immunity due to the production of IgA antibodies by the immune system-in addition to systemic immunity. Since 90 percent of diseases enter the body through a mucus membrane, a vaccine that coerces mucosal immunity is of great benefit in the prevention of many diseases.\n25. Suppose that an individual has been given a plant-derived oral vaccine against a specific virus. How could you determine whether the vaccine was effective?\n\nA.

Interleukins are cytokines that are secreted during the process of clonal selection in primary immune responses. Since they are not specific toward any one particular antigen, choice A can be eliminated. Interferons are produced as nonspecific defenses against viral infections. Virally infected cells secrete interferons that are detected by neighboring cells. Secretion of interferons gives neighboring cells the chance to increase their immune defenses so that they do not become infected by the virus. Since interferons are nonspecific, their presence would not indicate immunity against a specific virus, which eliminates choice B. The components of the complement system circulate in the plasma and are activated by bacteria that may enter the blood. Activation of the complement system ultimately lyses and kills the bacterial cell. Since the question is asking about a virus, choice C can be eliminated because it deals with bacteria. This leaves choice $\\mathrm{D}$ as the correct response.

When a person eats the plant, the viral or bacteria proteins serve as antigens, which initiates a primary immune response.\n\nSome of the plants that are of interest in edible vaccine development are bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, rice, tobacco, and soybeans. While early research focused on growing crops that produced edible products such as bananas, the most recent research is focused on extracting material from the leaves and seeds of the plants, dehydrating it, and putting it into capsules that can be swallowed. This allows for a more predictable dosage of the vaccine and eliminates concerns that the crops containing the vaccine would be accidentally eaten by individuals who are not in need of the vaccine. The term edible vaccine has now been replaced with the term plantderived oral vaccine.\n\nThe development of plant-derived oral vaccines solves many problems associated with injectable vaccines. Because plant-derived oral vaccines are grown in crops, there is no problem with storage or refrigeration that is required of most traditional vaccines. These plant-derived vaccines also require no special training to administer. Additionally, when a vaccine is taken orally, it provides mucosal immunity due to the production of IgA antibodies by the immune system-in addition to systemic immunity. Since 90 percent of diseases enter the body through a mucus membrane, a vaccine that coerces mucosal immunity is of great benefit in the prevention of many diseases.\n26. In order to engineer a plant-derived oral vaccine, genes from the microbe to be vaccinated against must be placed into the plant genome. Which of the following choices would be the most reasonable way to achieve this goal?\n\nA. Perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify copies of the bacterial or viral genes and then insert the copies into the plant cells by transduction.\n\nB. Insert the bacterial or viral genes of interest into a plasmid, which can serve as a vector to transfer the gene to the plant cell.\n\nC. Clone the genes into a bacterial cell and allow it to conjugate with a plant cell.\n\nD. Use DNA hybridization to allow the genes of interest from the bacterial or viral genome to hybridize with the plant DNA.

While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to amplify copies of target DNA, it would not help to get the viral or bacterial genes of interest into plant cells. This eliminates choice A. Choice $C$ suggests that the genes could be cloned into a bacterial cell and transferred to a plant cell by conjugation. Conjugation is unique to certain species of bacteria and occasionally is seen in fungi, but it does not happen in plants. So choice $C$ is eliminated. Choice D suggests that the genes of interest should be hybridized to the DNA of the plant. Since hybridization occurs between complementary base pairs, this would suggest that the DNA sequence of the gene of interest and the plant would have to be the same, which is not the case. This leaves choice B as the best option. Bacterial or viral genes can be spliced into plasmids. The plasmids serve as vectors to deliver the gene of interest to a variety of cell types, including plants.",

In order to test this possibility, two strains of mice are used-a knockout strain and a wild-type strain. The strain of knockout mice used in this study has a loss of function mutation in the interleukin $\\mathrm{X}$ gene. During the experiments to determine whether this new interleukin X might protect against HCV, the mice are exposed to an analog of HCV. Three weeks later, liver biopsies are taken from each of the mice. From the biopsied liver tissues, nucleic acids are extracted and polymerase chain reaction is used to detect the presence of $\\mathrm{HCV}$.\n\nIn the following data table, you will see data from 10 sets of mice in this experiment. A plus sign (+) indicates that PCR testing detected the presence of HCV and a minus sign $(-)$ indicates that PCR testing did not detect the presence of HCV.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{lllllllllll}\n\\hline Animal Number & $\\mathbf{1}$ & $\\mathbf{2}$ & $\\mathbf{3}$ & $\\mathbf{4}$ & $\\mathbf{5}$ & $\\mathbf{6}$ & $\\mathbf{7}$ & $\\mathbf{8}$ & $\\mathbf{9}$ & $\\mathbf{1 0}$ \\\\\n\\hline Wild-type & $-$ & $+$ & $-$ & $-$ & $+$ & $-$ & $-$ & $-$ & $-$ & $-$ \\\\\nKnockout & $+$ & $+$ & $-$ & $+$ & $+$ & $-$ & $+$ & $-$ & $+$ & $+$ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n36. Suppose that this newly discovered interleukin $X$ is proven to be effective against viral infection. In which of the following cases would we expect an individual to test negative for the hepatitis $\\mathrm{C}$ virus?\nA. an individual with decreased expression of interleukin $X$\nB. an individual with decreased expression of the receptor for interleukin $X$\nC. an individual with increased expression of the receptor for interleukin $\\mathrm{X}$\nD. an individual with a mutation in the receptor for interleukin $\\mathrm{X}$",

The goal of creating GM foods is to modify the organisms to express new and useful traits. A few examples involve engineering crops to be resistant to bacterial or viral infections, to be resistant to herbicides, to ripen more slowly, to survive extreme temperature changes, to contain vaccines, or to create crops that are more nutritious.\n\nOne GM food that has received media attention over the years is golden rice. This GM product was first introduced in 2000 and was engineered to provide carotene that is a precursor to vitamin $\\mathrm{A}$. The carotene in the rice provides the golden color. Vitamin A deficiency is a major problem in underdeveloped parts of the world, killing more than one million people a year, most of whom are children. This vitamin is critical for the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues, for vision, and for growth.\n\nRice plants normally produce carotene in the inedible parts of the plant. To be able to access and use the carotene, it was necessary to engineer the rice to produce it in the edible grains. In order to achieve this goal, two genes from daffodil plants, psy and $l y c$, and a bacterial gene called $c r t 1$ were added to the rice genome.

The product of this reaction (valine) clearly has a chiral center; therefore, the two achiral responses are invalid. Since the synthesis launches from an achiral material, and no chiral reagents are introduced along the way, the only reasonable outcome is to have a racemic mixture of enantiomers.

Since the attack can occur from either face of the iminium with equal probability, we expect to see an exactly $1: 1$ mixture of enantiomers.

This problem can be answered by referring to the equation for the height of the dye traveling through capillary action:\n\n$$\nh=\\frac{2 T}{\\rho g r}\n$$\n\nOf all of the options presented for consideration, the only one with direct relevance to a variable within the equation is choice A. The weight of the water is reflected by the term $\\rho g$, which must be pulled up the stem by the surface tension. The presence of sugar increases the weight of the water to be taken up the stem by capillary action and thus it travels more slowly. At each time interval recorded in the experiment, the dye in beakers 2 and 3 does not travel as high up the stem as the stem placed in beaker 1.",

Ballast waifs are less natural in origin; they are seeds that arrive on one shore from another in the soil placed in a ship's hold as ballast.\n\nOne remarkably lovely and dreadfully damaging ballast waif is Lythrum salicaria, the bright purple, spiky flower known commonly as purple loosestrife. Purple loosestrife is not a newcomer to U.S. shores; it arrived from Eurasia, almost certainly via ship, some 200 years ago. It was widely used for medicinal and ornamental purposes throughout the 19th century. Its lovely purple blooms may still be seen in gardens throughout the country, where people love it for its long growing season.\n\nFor all its beauty, purple loosestrife is a menace. The same long growing season that makes it so beloved by gardeners makes it a seed-making machine. A mature plant may produce 2 or 3 million seeds a year.\n\nThat is not enough for Lythrum salicaria, however. It also propagates underground, sending out shoots and stems in all directions. It is also able to cross-pollinate with other species of Lythrum.\n\nScientists took little notice of purple loosestrife until sometime in the 1930s, when a particular strain began colonizing along the St. Lawrence River, an area rife with the sort of wetlands purple loosestrife likes best. Purple loosestrife does not just propagate wildly; it also adapts easily to changes in environment.

This not only eradicates the native plants, but it also removes food sources for migratory birds and other animals.\n\nIn recent years, purple loosestrife has had a devastating impact on native cattails and wild rice. It has invaded and destroyed spawning areas for fish. In rural areas, it is beginning to move away from wetlands and adapt to drier areas, encroaching on agricultural lands. In urban areas, it is blocking pipes and drainage canals. It has moved steadily westward and is now found in all states but Florida.\n\nAttempts to control purple loosestrife have been only partially successful. It has proved resistant to many herbicides, and it is impervious to burning, as its rootstock lies beneath the surface and can reproduce from there. It can be mowed down and plowed under, and then replaced with a less invasive plant. This is very labor-intensive in marshy areas that are substantially overgrown, but it may be the only way of eliminating the pest. Plowing it under requires unusually large discs on the plow because it is important to chop up the rootstock.

Like many wars of the 19th century, it was declared not by Parliament but rather by people on the scene. Sir Henry Bartle Frere was an emissary of the Queen, sent to Cape Town to find a way to unify the British and Boer colonies with a variety of independent black states to form a Confederation of South Africa. Standing in his way was the Zulu Army, a robust contingent of 40,000 warriors under the leadership of King Cetshwayo.\n\nFrere looked for a way to seize Zululand. He used a series of minor border disputes to prompt an ultimatum to Cetshwayo, demanding that his army disband and be remodeled within 30 days. Cetshwayo refused to reply, which led to a state of war. A month and a half later, a British force invaded Zululand. They moved in three columns toward the royal compound.\n\nOn the 22nd of January, the middle column, led by Lord Chelmsford, a favorite of the Queen, split, with Chelmsford leading a large force to support a small reconnoitering party. The 1,750 left at camp soon found themselves surrounded by nearly 20,000 Zulus. Notice was sent to Chelmsford, but he would not be deflected from his plan. The resulting massacre at Isandhlwana reduced the middle column by 1,350 men. Some SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\n\nof the survivors retreated to Rorke's Drift, where they joined a small force of about 100 men who had successfully held off a few thousand warriors.\n\nNews of the massacre made its way to England, but Chelmsford, quite the modern military man, had already put a cover-up in place. He managed to convince the Queen and some of the press that Isandhlwana was overcome due to a lack of ammunition, and he put forth Rorke's Drift as a major victory, allowing that minor skirmish to be glorified as the massacre was all but forgotten. He would later blame Isandhlwana on the disobedience of an officer who died there.\n\nChelmsford's self-supporting propaganda was effective for a while, but as the Zulu War turned even bloodier, albeit more successful for the British, he was eventually recalled and replaced by Field Marshal Wolseley. Wolseley would command the British troops through the final campaigns of the Zulu War, campaigns that culminated in the capture of King Cetshwayo. The British divided up Cetshwayo's kingdom into 13 minichiefdoms, granting 11 to Zulus, 1 to a pro-British Basuto chief, and 1 to a white African mercenary. This plan led to many years of civil war, and in 1882, the British restored Cetshwayo to his throne, leaving his son in charge of a nearby territory. In 1883 that son joined with a band of Boer mercenaries and invaded his father's kraal, forcing his father into exile, where he soon died under mysterious circumstances. In league with the Boer who would become the first prime minister of South Africa, Louis Botha, a second son of Cetshwayo's attacked his brother and defeated his army.

Pig Latin may have begun as a language spoken in prisoner-of-war camps; it was certainly used in such camps during World War II and in Vietnam.\n\nIn Pig Latin, the phrase \"Over the river and through the woods\" becomes \"Overay uhthay iverray anday oughthray uhthay oodsway.\" In other variations of Pig Latin, it might instead be \"Overway uhthay iverray andway oughthray uhthay oodsway.\" There are computer programs that translate from English to Pig Latin and back again, and there is even a version of the Bible written entirely in Pig Latin. For the most part, however, outside of prisoner-of-war camps, Pig Latin is a funny code used by children.\n\nFrench children and teenagers use a similar code. Called verlan (a reversal of l'envers, or \"reversal\"), it is trickier than Pig Latin because it relies much more on phonetics than on spelling. In verlan, the word caf\u00e9 becomes f\u00e9ca, but the word tomber (\"to fall\") becomes b\u00e9ton. Verlan becomes even more complex in words that end in silent $e$ or which have only one syllable. While just a few words from Pig Latin have entered the vernacular (for example, amscray and ixnay), many verlan words are common lingo in France.\n\nHistorically, for reasons that are not quite clear, butchers have been frequent users of metathesis, creating their own backslang to converse without being understood by patrons. In France, this is called louch\u00e9bem (boucher, or \"butcher,\" with the first consonant moved to the end and the letter $l$ placed in front). In Australia, it is known as rechtub klat. That name, of course, represents the ultimate in metathesis-the reversal of letters instead of merely syllables.\n33. The passage implies that Pig Latin is NOT pure metathesis because it:\n\nPractice Test 2\nA. does not transpose phonemes\nB. is not accidental\nC. includes the addition of an extra syllable\nD. does not add to the language",

Atomistic thinkers, such as Descartes and Wittgenstein, believe that the whole is no more than the sum of its parts. A thorough study of these parts, atomists believe, will lead to an understanding of the whole. A contrasting view, held by Schelling, Hegel (although some scholars question whether Hegel's ontology actually conforms to this formalist conception of totality), and members of the structuralist school of philosophy, holds that the whole has an identity of its own, separate from the nature of its component parts. A third view, and perhaps the most challenging to explore, is the dialectical\/materialist idea of the whole held by Karl Marx. In this view, the whole is seen not simply as the sum of its parts as atomists believe or as something independent of its parts according to formalist thought. Instead, the whole is conceived of as the constantly changing and evolving interactions between all of its component parts.\n\nIn Marx's view, there are no things\u2014static, independent objects or ideas-there are only processes. Everything that makes up the world is constantly in the process of becoming, with both its past and its future encapsulated in the very notion of the object itself. Furthermore, according to the dialectical materialist view, all objects are interdependent and the interactions they have with each other are also parts of their totalities.\n\nCritics of this perspective point out, somewhat justifiably, that such an ontology has a number of difficulties. One of their major objections is that dialectical materialism is impractical to employ in any meaningful way. Consider how thinking of even a simple object such as a chair in this way quickly leads to a surfeit of information, connections, and processes. For a chair is not simply a chair, but the result of the labor of an individual, a process of manufacturing, the needs of a society that requires chairs, and many other factors. And each of these factors has its own past (and future) and myriad other connections as well. The number of relationships increases exponentially, which quickly makes a dialectical worldview utterly overwhelming to even the most agile philosophical mind.\n\nMarxist philosophers attempt to work around this potential pathology by invoking what is called the process of abstraction. Abstraction allows the philosopher to draw certain boundaries around the object, idea, or relationship studied. Typically, these abstractions involve deciding an appropriate time scale to consider, the level of generality necessary for understanding specific interactions, and the vantage point from which to view a particular object of study. Abstraction on these levels allows the philosopher to bring certain relationships and processes into greater focus in order to understand them, while always keeping in mind that such an abstraction necessarily obscures various other connections. Marx famously used this process in his study of capitalism, sometimes viewing the system from the vantage point of the capitalist, other times assuming the perch of the worker, and even at times trying to view the system from the perspective of capital itself. Similarly, sometimes Marx generalized people as simply members of their class in order to gain a better grasp of the relationship between owner and worker.

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 40-47 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage VII\n\nBiologists use the term \"living fossil\" to designate a species that maintains many of the features of its ancient ancestors. These species have evidenced very little evolutionary change, indicating not that they are primitive creatures as might be popularly believed, but instead that they are exquisitely suited for their biological and ecological niches and thus have not had any selection pressures to respond to.\n\nThe four most celebrated living fossils are the lungfish, the horseshoe crab, the lampshell, and the coelacanth. The horseshoe crab is the relative youngster of the group, belonging to the Jurassic period and having shown little structural changes in its 200-million-year lifespan. The lampshell, a member of the phylum Brachiopoda, is part of an even older lineage, resembling ancestors that lived nearly 400 million years ago.\n\nThe oldest members of the living fossil family are the lungfish and the coelacanth, both species that are remarkably similar to their forebears that roamed the Earth almost 425 million years ago. The lungfish, of which there are six surviving species, has the same basic structure and fleshy lobe fins of its progenitor, the sarcopterygian. Of course, the lungfish has long interested biologists not just because of its connections to the distant past but because of the bridge it represents between aquatic species and land dwellers. In fact, the African and South American species of lungfish live part of their lives entirely on land, burrowing into mud and respiring through a tiny breathing hole in their earthy homes. Although the lungfish has remained evolutionarily stable for close to 250 million years, prior to that the species did experience rapid and dynamic evolutionary change. However, by the end of the Permian period, the changes ground to a halt, and the lungfish has persevered happily ever since.\n\nThe singular story of the coelacanth stretches all the way from the Silurian period, some 425 million years ago, to the modern day. The coelacanths were well-known from the fossil record and dating technologies placed them in a time when plants were just beginning to encroach on the land. However, biologists thought the species went extinct long before the dinosaurs did.

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 48-53 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage VIII\n\nFor years, a great many political scientists have been puzzled by what appears to be the most basic of all political questions: why vote? Of course, it's not that voting is an overly troublesome or burdensome activity; commonsense explanations of voting behavior are often borne out through empirical study. People vote in order to express their preferences for a particular candidate or platform, to demonstrate their civic pride, or to involve themselves in the political process. The puzzle lies instead in the actual act of voting, which in many ways conforms to what social scientists term the \"free-rider problem.\" Any social good that spreads both costs and benefits amongst a number of citizens encourages the citizens to attempt to reap the benefits without incurring the costs. Given the almost infinitesimal chance that any one individual's vote would actually affect the outcome of an election and given that the supporters of the winning candidate all share equally in the benefit of that candidate's election, the costs of voting, no matter how minor they may be, appear to make voting an irrational act. Better to stay home on election day and let the others do the heavy lifting, the thinking goes.\n\nBut the fact is people do get up on election day and vote. Various theories have been postulated to explain this seemingly irrational behavior, but there are three factors that political scientists return to again and again: resources, mobilization, and instrumental motivation.\n\nResources refer to both material possessions such as money and transportation, and immaterial things such as time and political knowledge. Mobilization refers to the pressures the media, political parties, and other groups can exert on an individual in order to make him or her feel compelled to vote. Instrumental motivation is the extent to which a person believes his or her vote will actually affect the outcome of the election.\n\nOf these three critical factors, resources has received the most scholarly attention. According to a classic view of voting behavior, people vote because they have the time and the money to do so. Some political scientists have even calculated what they call a baseline model of political participation. This model attempts to predict political participation based on an individual's level of education, income, and several other occupational variables. Certain individual traits may affect the final decision, but the theory holds that the level of resources is a better predictor of political behavior than any other factor.\n\nUnfortunately, this model, while achieving some success when applied to actual political behavior, suffers from a serious flaw.

Cystic fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of abnormally thick mucus throughout the body and the loss of excess amounts of salt via sweat. The thick mucus builds up and causes major problems in the lungs, which often become infected, and can cause digestive abnormalities such as malnutrition and blockages through the intestinal tract. The severity of the disease is variable, and many other potential complications can arise.\n\nThe gene involved in cystic fibrosis is a mutated allele of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). At least 900 known mutations of this gene can lead to cystic fibrosis. The normal CFTR gene produces the CFTR protein that is a transmembrane chloride channel in cells of the lungs, digestive tract, skin, and reproductive tract. One mutation termed delta F508 has a single amino acid change in the protein that marks it for destruction before it ever reaches the membrane to complete its function.

The genetic code lists all possible codons. One codon always specifies one amino acid. If the protein is 1480 amino acids long, you might suspect that the mRNA had 1480 codons. However, an additional codon would be present that served as the stop codon. The stop codon does not code for an amino acid, but instead signals the end of translation and the release of the protein. Therefore, 1481 codons would be present on the mRNA.",

This disease is one of the most common recessive genetic diseases and is often fatal. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of abnormally thick mucus throughout the body and the loss of excess amounts of salt via sweat. The thick mucus builds up and causes major problems in the lungs, which often become infected, and can cause digestive abnormalities such as malnutrition and blockages through the intestinal tract. The severity of the disease is variable, and many other potential complications can arise.\n\nThe gene involved in cystic fibrosis is a mutated allele of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). At least 900 known mutations of this gene can lead to cystic fibrosis. The normal CFTR gene produces the CFTR protein that is a transmembrane chloride channel in cells of the lungs, digestive tract, skin, and reproductive tract. One mutation termed delta F508 has a single amino acid change in the protein that marks it for destruction before it ever reaches the membrane to complete its function. Without the proper CFTR in the membrane of cells, the chloride and sodium ion balance is altered such that not enough water leaves the cells to produce mucus of the proper consistency. The thick mucus that results accumulates and causes multiple problems, including the trapping of bacteria that can cause infections. Although there is no cure for cystic fibrosis, better management strategies have increased the life span of people with this genetic disease.\n7.

This question requires you to locate the most logical explanation as to why antibiotic genes are often purposefully transferred along with a gene of interest in biotechnology procedures. Because the question does not provide information on what type of cells are being transformed, don't assume anything. Choice A suggests that you need resistance genes transferred so the cells can survive in the presence of antibiotics. If the cells transformed are not bacterial, they would survive anyway, as antibiotics would target and kill only bacteria. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ suggests that the antibiotic genes are transferred out of convenience because they happen to be near the gene of interest. If the gene of interest is not coming from bacteria, then there could not be any antibiotic resistance genes nearby. Choice D really doesn't offer much in the way of logic, suggesting that antibiotic resistance would be necessary to prevent infection in transformed cells. The only logical explanation is choice B. In order to determine if a cell was transformed with the gene of interest or not, antibiotics could be added. The transformed cells that picked up the gene of interest would also pick up the antibiotic resistance marker and would grow in the presence of antibiotics. The nontransformed cells would not be resistant to the antibiotics and would be killed.",

        "Solution": "42. The correct answer is $\\mathbf{A}$. The myelin sheath is used to insulate the axons of neurons. Within the myelin sheath there are gaps, known as nodes of Ranvier, where the myelin is absent. Action potentials move down the axon and jump from one node to the next. When the myelin is removed, the gap from one node to the next becomes so large that the action potential can no longer jump the gap.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is secreted by the pituitary gland in response to declining levels ofT3 and T4. TSH activates the thyroid gland to release T3 and T4, which are stored as thyroglobulin (bound to protein). T3 is about five times more physiologically potent than T4. Thyroglobulin is enzymatically converted to T3, T4, and globulin, and T3 and T4 are released. T4 is converted in the liver to T3 and reverse T3 (RT3). About $80 \\%$ of T3 comes from T4 conversion and the other $20 \\%$ comes directly from the thyroid gland. Reverse T3 blocks the action of T3 and T4 by occupying T3 and T4 cell receptor sites. A symptom of a thyroid hormone abnormality is the swelling of the thyroid that is referred to as a goiter, which can necessitate a portion or even all of the thyroid gland being surgically removed. After the surgery, synthetic hormones are given in an attempt to regulate the metabolism.

The data shows increased levels of T3 (when compared to expected values), and the choice indicates that T3 levels are decreased. The passage indicates an inverse relationship between TSH and T3\/T4. When TSH is high, this is in response to low T3 and T4. When TSH is low, this is in response to high levels of T3 and T4.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is secreted by the pituitary gland in response to declining levels ofT3 and T4.

        "Solution": "50. The correct answer is A. To answer this question, you need to be familiar with mechanisms used in the body to maintain calcium homeostasis and bone cell action. The hormones calcitonin and parathyroid hormone both regulate blood calcium levels. Calcitonin, secreted by the thyroid gland, decreases blood calcium by storing excess calcium in bone matrix due to the activity of osteoblasts. Parathyroid hormone, secreted by the parathyroid glands located on top of the thyroid, is antagonistic to calcitonin and increases blood calcium levels. Osteoblasts are bone cells that build bone tissue when there is excess calcium. Their activity is regulated by calcitonin. When active, osteoblasts reduce blood calcium levels. Osteoclasts break down bone tissue and are regulated by parathyroid hormone. When active, osteoclasts increase blood calcium levels. If a patient has had his or her thyroid and parathyroids removed, it would be safe to assume that calcitonin and parathyroid levels would be decreased, making it difficult to regulate blood calcium levels. Choice B suggests that activating osteoblasts would help increase calcium levels. Because osteoblasts build bone and decrease blood calcium, this would actually further decrease the calcium levels in the blood. Taking synthetic calcitonin as suggested by choices $C$ and $D$ would only decrease calcium levels further because calcitonin activates osteoblasts. One potential solution to increase blood calcium levels would be to increase bone matrix breakdown as suggested by choice A. Osteoclasts are the bone cells responsible for this response.",

        "Solution": "16. The correct answer is A. In single-slit diffraction, light (electromagnetic radiation) passes through a small slit within a diffraction grating and moves toward a screen as wavefronts. As the wavefronts strike the screen, points within the wavefronts will either amplify as a result of constructive interference or cancel each other as a result of destructive interference. The alternating patterns of constructive and destructive interference will result in a pattern of bright and dark fringes on the screen. This observation is indicative of the wavelike behavior of light. Compton scattering involves a two-dimensional elastic collision that can take place only if particles are involved. An electron is a particle, and thus in order to observe the Compton effect, light (electromagnetic radiation) must also behave as a particle.",

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 2-5 are based on the following passage.\n\n\\section{Passage I}\n\nResearchers studying signal detection have documented various magnitude differences necessary to detect the presence of stimuli (absolute threshold) and to detect changes in the perceptual experience of the stimuli (just noticeable difference). These differences are dependent on the type of sensory experience being measured and can be characterized by proportional differences in magnitude rather than absolute amounts.\n\nA recent study examined the just noticeable difference necessary to perceive tempo changes. In this experiment, signal detection methods were used to examine the amount of change necessary to detect a difference between an initial\/target tempo and a comparison stimulus. Two test conditions were evaluated. The initial\/target tempo MCAT\n\nspeed was either slow (43 beats per minute [bpm]) or fast (75 bpm). Comparison tempos were presented that were either sped up or slowed down relative to the initial\/ target tempo. Participants were asked to identify whether the comparison tempos were the same tempo or a different tempo from the initial\/target tempo. The accompanying graph depicts the tempo changes necessary for detection for both the slow and fast initial\/target tempos.\n\n\nDetecting tempo change (beats per minute).

We can actively choose to be happy. It was previously thought that levels of happiness were genetically determined; people were born with a genetic predisposition to cheerfulness or pessimism. However, studies now suggest that such predispositions, although present, are not fixed. Instead, emotion, and indeed the structure of the brain, can be modified through certain practices.\n\nThese findings are indebted to the work of psychologist Gordon Watson, who in 1930 conducted a study entitled \"Happiness Among Adult Students of Education.\" Because happiness was considered a highly desired yet elusive and mysterious emotion, Watson's serious endeavor was startling. By the 1970s, the psychological community was researching happiness on a larger scale. Today, it is estimated that over 2000 researchers in 42 countries are actively involved in happiness research.\n\nIn that crowded field, the work of a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Richard Davidson, stands out. Davidson observed patterns of brain activity as they related to a subject's mental and emotional states, using brain science's new technologies, including quantitative electrophysiology, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. He discovered what Western science once believed to be impossible: that the brain is not a static organ-it is able to change and develop over time. This capacity is known as neuroplasticity, and it has had a profound effect on the study of happiness.\n\nDavidson's studies found that the functions of the brain's cerebral cortex are not limited to determining intelligence, interpreting sensory impulses, and controlling motor function as once believed. In fact, this area also determines personality, including emotional predispositions. Levels of activity on the right and left sides of the cerebral cortex relate to feelings of happiness and sadness. Specifically, higher levels of activity at the left frontal area of the cerebral cortex coincide with feelings of happiness, For example, meditation has been shown to generate left-brain activity, and studies show that it produces positive emotions. Davidson studied the link between meditation and happiness through a project involving Tibetan Buddhist monks. His research brings together Eastern and Western traditions, and it links together objective reality with internal states of consciousness once thought to be subjective. The connection is made through observable electrical activity in the central nervous system. When the monks in the study meditated, their brain activity was recorded. Increases in left cerebral cortex activity indicate that the practice of meditation can, over time, change the structure of the brain, increasing the size and activity level of the left cerebral cortex.\n\nAnother practice that has been shown to stimulate left cerebral cortex activity and enhance feelings of happiness is the altering of conscious thoughts. More specifically, when a subject repeats positive affirmations_thinking optimistic thoughts-activity in the left cerebral cortex increases. As with the practice of meditation, the repetition of positive affirmations can change the structure of the brain over time, creating feelings of happiness and well-being.

During his lifetime, however, he was the most celebrated poet in the country. A closer look at the history of American poetry reveals that, despite his eminence, Longfellow wrote in a mold of both form and content that was already being challenged during his lifetime. But why, a century later, do the artistic works of many of his contemporaries continue to be enjoyed and studied while Longfellow languishes in the tomb of cultural artifacts?\n\nOne answer lies in the radical shift that began to take place in poetry in the mid19th century. Longfellow's themes and steadfast rhymes (and those of John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell) gave way gradually to confessional verse, whose subjects were more personal and rhymes were looser and less conventional. But to understand this shift, one must first understand the nature of Longfellow's work and his standing in the American literary scene of his time.\n\nLongfellow took as his subject his country's historical imagination, writing on an epic scale about Paul Revere, the Indian Hiawatha, and the pilgrim Miles Standish. He bestowed a mythic dimension on these figures, giving American readers iconic images that helped form a collective consciousness in the new country (indeed, Longfellow was a part of the first generation to be born in the United States). But Longfellow's content went beyond nationalistic pride-it was highly accessible and incredibly popular. Its accessibility is explained by his obvious themes that could be easily understood and embraced by the public. Longfellow did not challenge his readers, but appealed to their desire for stories that expounded an optimistic, sentimental, and moralistic worldview. Those themes were explored in rhyme that allowed readers to commit the poems to memory, much like songs. In 1857, The Song of Hiawatha, arguably his bestknown poem, sold 50,000 copies, an astounding number at the time. The next year, The Courtship of Miles Standish sold 25,000 copies in two months and in London sold 10,000 copies in one day. His success allowed him to give up a professorship at Harvard and focus full time on his writing.\n\nWalt Whitman, Longfellow's contemporary, wrote poetry similar to that of Longfellow-romantic and sentimental, with conventional rhyme and meter. But in the 1850s, indeed two years before The Song of Hiawatha, he wrote and published Leaves of Grass; a more radical departure from his previous work could not have been imagined. The 12 unnamed poems comprising Leaves of Grass are written in free verse-that is, without conventional rhyme and meter.

According to the passage, what might be the current reputation of poets such as Whittier and Holmes?\n\nA. They are considered integral writers in the history of American poetry.\n\nB.

Sales figures for Longfellow's poems about iconic American figures are cited as facts and not implied to be an apparent belief of the author, making choice A incorrect. Although Emerson is revealed to be an influence on Whitman, there is nothing in the passage to suggest that he could be considered by the author to be the Father of American Poetry (in fact, he is not mentioned as being a poet), making choice $\\mathrm{C}$ incorrect. The passage clearly delineates the vast differences between the work of Longfellow and confessional poetry; therefore, choice D must also be wrong. The terms the author uses to describe Whitman and his work in the last paragraph (\"groundbreaking,\" \"legacy\") enforce his view that Whitman's poetry is more popular than Longfellow's (that resides in a \"tomb\").",

During his lifetime, however, he was the most celebrated poet in the country. A closer look at the history of American poetry reveals that, despite his eminence, Longfellow wrote in a mold of both form and content that was already being challenged during his lifetime. But why, a century later, do the artistic works of many of his contemporaries continue to be enjoyed and studied while Longfellow languishes in the tomb of cultural artifacts?\n\nOne answer lies in the radical shift that began to take place in poetry in the mid19th century. Longfellow's themes and steadfast rhymes (and those of John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell) gave way gradually to confessional verse, whose subjects were more personal and rhymes were looser and less conventional. But to understand this shift, one must first understand the nature of Longfellow's work and his standing in the American literary scene of his time.\n\nLongfellow took as his subject his country's historical imagination, writing on an epic scale about Paul Revere, the Indian Hiawatha, and the pilgrim Miles Standish. He bestowed a mythic dimension on these figures, giving American readers iconic images that helped form a collective consciousness in the new country (indeed, Longfellow was a part of the first generation to be born in the United States). But Longfellow's content went beyond nationalistic pride-it was highly accessible and incredibly popular. Its accessibility is explained by his obvious themes that could be easily understood and embraced by the public. Longfellow did not challenge his readers, but appealed to their desire for stories that expounded an optimistic, sentimental, and moralistic worldview. Those themes were explored in rhyme that allowed readers to commit the poems to memory, much like songs. In 1857, The Song of Hiawatha, arguably his bestknown poem, sold 50,000 copies, an astounding number at the time. The next year, The Courtship of Miles Standish sold 25,000 copies in two months and in London sold 10,000 copies in one day. His success allowed him to give up a professorship at Harvard and focus full time on his writing.\n\nWalt Whitman, Longfellow's contemporary, wrote poetry similar to that of Longfellow-romantic and sentimental, with conventional rhyme and meter. But in the 1850s, indeed two years before The Song of Hiawatha, he wrote and published Leaves of Grass; a more radical departure from his previous work could not have been imagined.

Some thought the switch in loyalties was sour grapes, but others saw Alfred E. Smith as the epitome of William Wordsworth's \"happy warrior\" and therefore a man who \"makes his moral being his prime care\"-one who never made a move without consulting his conscience.\n\nAlfred E. Smith was both a successful politician and an unsuccessful one. A fourterm governor of New York State, he seemed a sure candidate for president, and indeed he ran three times for that position, only to lose each time.\n\nHe had several strikes against him. He was the Catholic son of Irish and ItalianGerman immigrants, making him anathema to nativists, the xenophobes who underwent a resurgence in the 1920s. He was from New York City, viewed even in the early twentieth century as disconnected from the national character. He was a progressive, which made conservatives of all stripes nervous. And he favored the repeal of Prohibition, a position that lost him the backing of many party leaders.\n\nWho was this unlikely candidate? Born Alfred Emanuel Smith in 1873, Smith grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His father died when Smith was young, and the boy dropped out of school to take care of the family. At age 21, Smith supported a losing candidate in a local race and came to the attention of New York politicos, who took him under their wing. Nine years later, he ran successfully for the New York State Assembly, where he rapidly rose in the ranks to become Majority Leader and finally Speaker. He played a pivotal role in the revamping of New York's constitution, was elected sheriff of New York County, and then ran for governor in 1918, winning handily. Although he lost a re-election bid two years later, he surged back in 1922 and would remain in the governor's seat for six more years. His terms were marked by unparalleled improvements in labor laws and laws protecting civil liberties, for Smith's goal was to support those he saw as most in need of government's assistance.\n\nIn this goal, he was allied with Franklin Roosevelt, and the two were close enough that Roosevelt nominated Smith for president in 1924. The Drys, or Prohibitionists, backed William McAdoo, a son-in-law of former President Woodrow Wilson. Smith's supporters and McAdoo's supporters were so far apart that finally a compromise candidate, John Davis, was nominated and promptly lost the general election to Calvin Coolidge.\n\nIn 1928, Smith received his party's nomination on the second ballot, but along with his anti-Prohibition leanings, his religion became a major issue during the campaign, paving the way for Herbert Hoover to win the general election. Meanwhile, Smith had arranged for the nomination of his New York colleague, Franklin Roosevelt, to be governor of New York. Although Smith lost his bid, Roosevelt did not. Then came the Depression and the election of 1932. Backroom dealings ensured that Franklin Roosevelt won the nominating process, with another would-be presidential candidate in the vice-presidential spot on the ticket. Smith was left out in the cold on his third try for the presidency. Despite his former regard for Roosevelt, he began to work hard, if unsuccessfully, to defeat the New Deal. He supported two Republicans rather than Roosevelt in the 1936 and 1940 elections, and he died in 1944, a man who had never reached his desired goal, yet had inspired many of the changes for which his rival is now known.\n38. One important argument of the final paragraph is that:\nA. Roosevelt would have done better with Smith at his side.\nB. The New Deal was anathema to someone with Smith's ideals.\nC.

He was the Catholic son of Irish and ItalianGerman immigrants, making him anathema to nativists, the xenophobes who underwent a resurgence in the 1920s. He was from New York City, viewed even in the early twentieth century as disconnected from the national character. He was a progressive, which made conservatives of all stripes nervous. And he favored the repeal of Prohibition, a position that lost him the backing of many party leaders.\n\nWho was this unlikely candidate? Born Alfred Emanuel Smith in 1873, Smith grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His father died when Smith was young, and the boy dropped out of school to take care of the family. At age 21, Smith supported a losing candidate in a local race and came to the attention of New York politicos, who took him under their wing. Nine years later, he ran successfully for the New York State Assembly, where he rapidly rose in the ranks to become Majority Leader and finally Speaker. He played a pivotal role in the revamping of New York's constitution, was elected sheriff of New York County, and then ran for governor in 1918, winning handily. Although he lost a re-election bid two years later, he surged back in 1922 and would remain in the governor's seat for six more years. His terms were marked by unparalleled improvements in labor laws and laws protecting civil liberties, for Smith's goal was to support those he saw as most in need of government's assistance.\n\nIn this goal, he was allied with Franklin Roosevelt, and the two were close enough that Roosevelt nominated Smith for president in 1924. The Drys, or Prohibitionists, backed William McAdoo, a son-in-law of former President Woodrow Wilson. Smith's supporters and McAdoo's supporters were so far apart that finally a compromise candidate, John Davis, was nominated and promptly lost the general election to Calvin Coolidge.\n\nIn 1928, Smith received his party's nomination on the second ballot, but along with his anti-Prohibition leanings, his religion became a major issue during the campaign, paving the way for Herbert Hoover to win the general election. Meanwhile, Smith had arranged for the nomination of his New York colleague, Franklin Roosevelt, to be governor of New York. Although Smith lost his bid, Roosevelt did not. Then came the Depression and the election of 1932. Backroom dealings ensured that Franklin Roosevelt won the nominating process, with another would-be presidential candidate in the vice-presidential spot on the ticket. Smith was left out in the cold on his third try for the presidency. Despite his former regard for Roosevelt, he began to work hard, if unsuccessfully, to defeat the New Deal. He supported two Republicans rather than Roosevelt in the 1936 and 1940 elections, and he died in 1944, a man who had never reached his desired goal, yet had inspired many of the changes for which his rival is now known.\n42.

In contrast, today there are more than 40 megacities, most in less developed countries, and more urban centers are expected to explode in population by the year 2020. Demographers and globalization experts are already referring to the 21 st century as \"the urban century.\"\n\nAlready, more people on our Earth live in cities than live in rural areas. This is an enormous change in population trends, and it skews the entire planet in ways we haven't begun to analyze.\n\nAlthough some cities have seen immigration expand their borders, for most megacities, it is migration from within the country that has caused the city to grow. An example is China, where some 150 million rural inhabitants have migrated to cities in just the last 10 years. In many cases, the cities house the only possibilities of employment in this global economy. That is what has grown Mumbai (Bombay), India, from a large city to a megacity of more than 18 million people in just a few years. It's the cause of the explosion of populations in Lagos, Nigeria; Karachi, Pakistan; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\nWhereas just a few years ago, most large cities were in developed nations, now the largest are suddenly in the less developed countries of South America, Africa, and Asia. Imagine the pressure on the infrastructure of these already poor cities as the influx of workers pushes services to the breaking point. Slums and shantytowns spring up around the outskirts of the cities, and government is powerless to affect the disadvantaged workers, leaving them exposed to corrupt local officials or urban gangs. Imagine, too, what happens in the rural areas that these people have abandoned. China faces a desperate shortage of agricultural labor. So do other areas of Asia and Africa.\n\nAccording to United Nations (UN) statistics, by the year 2030, more than 60 percent of the world population will be urban, up from 30 percent in 1950 . Unlike the population growth in developed nations, the birth rate in less developed nations is high, meaning that the cities continue to grow even as migration slows from the rural areas. Megacities such as New York have populations that have leveled off over time. Despite its location in a less developed nation, even a megacity such as Mexico City has a slow rate of growth compared to Asian and African cities such as Mumbai or Lagos.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine what the growth of the megacities will mean to the world in the 21st century. Demographers foresee ecological overload, homelessness, uncontrolled traffic, and an infrastructure strained to the breaking point. Despite the notion that industrial jobs improve the lot of the workers, it is already possible to see that megacities are creating a new, even deeper division between rich and poor, as the poor concentrate in the outskirts of town and the rich barricade themselves behind walls and in towers.\n45. The main argument of the passage is that:\nA. Megacities are more often found in less developed nations but strain the resources of developed nations.\nB. The growth in population and number of megacities means foreseeable changes, many of them negative.\nC. The movement of population bases from rural to urban locations decimates the countryside and limits our ability to grow food.\nD.

An example is China, where some 150 million rural inhabitants have migrated to cities in just the last 10 years. In many cases, the cities house the only possibilities of employment in this global economy. That is what has grown Mumbai (Bombay), India, from a large city to a megacity of more than 18 million people in just a few years. It's the cause of the explosion of populations in Lagos, Nigeria; Karachi, Pakistan; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Jakarta, Indonesia.\n\nWhereas just a few years ago, most large cities were in developed nations, now the largest are suddenly in the less developed countries of South America, Africa, and Asia. Imagine the pressure on the infrastructure of these already poor cities as the influx of workers pushes services to the breaking point. Slums and shantytowns spring up around the outskirts of the cities, and government is powerless to affect the disadvantaged workers, leaving them exposed to corrupt local officials or urban gangs. Imagine, too, what happens in the rural areas that these people have abandoned. China faces a desperate shortage of agricultural labor. So do other areas of Asia and Africa.\n\nAccording to United Nations (UN) statistics, by the year 2030, more than 60 percent of the world population will be urban, up from 30 percent in 1950 . Unlike the population growth in developed nations, the birth rate in less developed nations is high, meaning that the cities continue to grow even as migration slows from the rural areas. Megacities such as New York have populations that have leveled off over time. Despite its location in a less developed nation, even a megacity such as Mexico City has a slow rate of growth compared to Asian and African cities such as Mumbai or Lagos.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine what the growth of the megacities will mean to the world in the 21st century. Demographers foresee ecological overload, homelessness, uncontrolled traffic, and an infrastructure strained to the breaking point. Despite the notion that industrial jobs improve the lot of the workers, it is already possible to see that megacities are creating a new, even deeper division between rich and poor, as the poor concentrate in the outskirts of town and the rich barricade themselves behind walls and in towers.\n49. Which new information, if true, might CHALLENGE the author's contention that cities will continue to grow despite a slowing of migration from the countryside?\nA. Scientists are creating new strains of rice and wheat that require far less in the way of hands-on care.\nB. The number of people living below the poverty level will climb in less devel- oped and developed nations.\nC. Inflationary trends in heating oil and gasoline prices will limit most people's discretionary spending.\nD. New methods of birth control will limit the population explosion in the devel- oping world.",

        "Solution": "49. The correct answer is D. This incorporation of information question asks you to apply new evidence to an existing argument. This kind of question takes you furthest from the passage itself in an effort to get you to recognize its real-world applications. You might begin by scanning to locate the part of the passage that deals with the contention mentioned: that cities will continue to grow despite a slowing of migration from the countryside. It appears in paragraph 5 , and its causative link is the notion that \"the birth rate in less-developed nations is high.\" If you take away this cause, as choice D would do, then the author's supposition that cities will continue to grow has no foundation. None of the other answer choices would collapse the argument as well.",

        "Problem Statement": "Questions 50-53 are based on the following passage.\n\nPassage IX\n\nMuralism has long been a Mexican tradition, perhaps dating back to the Aztecs, who recorded their history on the walls of their pyramids. The covering of a white wall with political art made the careers of David Alfara Siqueiros, Jose Clemente Orozco, and the best known of them all, Diego Rivera.\n\nSiqueiros, born in Chihuahua, studied art from an early age. He organized a student strike at the age of 15 and later worked to unseat the Mexican dictator Huerta, attaining the rank of captain during the revolution that was taking place. He later brought his tactical knowledge to the world of organized labor, where his activism led to lengthy jail terms. That is where he created some of his finest artworks on canvas. During the 1930s, he went to Spain to join the anti-fascist forces. His life was that of a soldier-artist, and some considered him a dangerous, subversive gangster.\n\nOrozco, too, studied art as a youth and was inspired by the Mexican Revolution. One of his famous murals depicts the Holy Trinity as a worker, a soldier, and a peasant. Later he turned his focus to the dehumanizing effect of large cities on the people who live there. When he wasn't painting vast murals, Orozco was drawing political cartoons.\n\nRivera, the third of these Mexican Social Realists, los tres grandes, remains the most famous through sheer force of personality. His storytelling, his love affairs, his radicalism, and his love-hate relationship with the land of his birth informed his life and his paintings. He incorporated Mexican folklore and cultural icons into his murals in an effort to educate working people in their own history.\n\nIn the Chicano neighborhoods of the southwestern United States, political muralism still explodes onto bare walls in the form of graffiti. Edward Seymour's 1949 invention of canned spray paint provided would-be artists with an easy mode of expression, and the graffiti mural took off as an art form in the 1960s and 1970s. It began as outlaw art, which surely would have appealed to an outlaw such as Siqueiros. Despite the new artists' lack of formal training, some members of the outlaw group managed to create something beautiful while making political statements about poverty, injustice, diversity, and racism.\n\nOne extraordinary thing about this kind of public art is that it is truly for everyone. You do not need to enter the halls of a museum to see it; it resides on the walls of your local bodega or school or health clinic; you bounce your ball off of it in the basketball or handball court; you cover it over with posters for your favorite band or flyers about your lost pet.\n\nCertainly, many of the graffiti artists were reviled as nuisances, and their art was erased. For some, however, graffiti would prove a launching point into the world of fine art. Today, modern murals in Austin, San Antonio, Los Angeles, and Tucson, among others, attest to the power of the Mexican tradition of the muralist as purveyor of political thought.\n50.

Although the author refers to it as \"outlaw art\" and mentions that some people considered it a nuisance, that is clearly not the author's own impression. Phrases such as \"managed to create something beautiful while making political statements about poverty, injustice, diversity, and racism\" and \"public art ... that . . is truly for everyone\" put a positive spin on the topic. The author does not believe that graffiti is a \"pale imitation\" (choice B); instead, she indicates that the graffiti artists are following in the muralists' tradition.
