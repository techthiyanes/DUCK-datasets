        "Problem Statement": "Passage III\n\nSperm count in human males is influenced by a variety of factors. One of the most important variables affecting sperm count is the number of Sertoli cells located in seminiferous tubules of the testes. The Sertoli cells' primary function is to nurture cells through the process of spermatogenesis by providing them with nutrients and an environment conducive to spermatogenesis. Each Sertoli cell has a set number of spermatozoa that it can support. Sertoli cells have an additional role in forming the blood-testis barrier that provides immune privilege for the seminiferous tubules. This forms a physical barricade that keeps the developing sperm from coming into contact with cells of the immune system.\n\nWhile it is not clear as to all the factors involved in determining Sertoli cell number, it is apparent that their development is most critical during the first nine months of life and prior to puberty. Events that affect the development of Sertoli cells in young males can influence fertility later in life.

Sperm cells are haploid, and all are genetically different from each other and from other cells in the body. Because they are genetically different, they should express unique surface antigens. If the cells of the immune system were to contact the sperm, they would be perceived as foreign and could be subject to immune system attack, which would destroy the sperm. For this reason, the blood-testis barrier is required to keep the sperm away from the immune cells. The remaining choices do not make good sense. Sperm cells will eventually leave the reproductive system during ejaculation. It also would not make sense to indicate that the blood flow to the testes needs to be cut off. This would prevent oxygen and nutrient flow to the area.

When LH levels peak on the 14 th day of the cycle, the follicle ruptures, releasing the egg from the ovary and leaving the corpus luteum behind in the ovary. After ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes both estrogen and progesterone to inhibit GnRH. When GnRH is inhibited, FSH and LH will also be inhibited.

        "Solution": "22. The correct answer is $\\mathrm{B}$. Bacteria spontaneously mutate in order to produce diversity in the population. Some bacteria have spontaneous mutations, usually on plasmids, that allow them to survive in the presence of certain antibiotics. If the bacterial population is repeatedly exposed to that antibiotic due to overuse, it exerts selective pressure where only the resistant bacteria survive. These resistant bacteria multiply, and in the next generation a higher frequency of resistance is observed. Antibiotic resistance has nothing to do with people becoming resistant to antibiotics-it is all about the bacterial mutations.",

Blood from the right atrium passes through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle and then leaves the heart through the pulmonary semilunar valve. Blood is carried via the pulmonary arteries to the lungs where gas exchange occurs. After gas exchange occurs, oxygenated blood returns to the heart via pulmonary veins to enter the left atrium. From there blood passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle. Blood leaves the left side of the heart by passing through the aortic valve into the aorta.

When the nephrons absorb more water to increase blood volume, the urine volume decreases. The two hormones aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone help increase the amount of water reabsorbed by nephrons, which in turn decreases urine volume. In order to reduce blood pressure, the kidneys can decrease the amount of water reabsorbed by the nephrons. The less water reabsorbed means there will be less blood volume and less blood pressure. This would ultimately increase urine volume. The question asks how the kidneys might try to reduce hypertension.

        "Problem Statement": "Passage VII\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is known to infect T cells and macrophages possessing the CD4 receptor. In addition to the CD4 receptor, there are a variety of coreceptors that are also needed for certain strains of HIV to infect cells. One of these coreceptors is called CCR5 and is needed for the most common strains of HIV (called R5) to infect their host cells. The more CCR5 receptors a cell has, the greater the rate of infection for the cell. Some individuals have the delta-32 allele of CCR5 that leads to a decreased risk of HIV infection.\n\nWomen are at a much higher risk for contracting HIV from a male partner than a male is for contracting HIV from a female partner. Some of the increased risk for women is dependent on sex hormones. It has been hypothesized that women have different risks of contracting HIV at different points in their reproductive cycles. For example, women may be at a greater risk of contracting HIV following ovulation during the last 2 weeks of their cycle as opposed to the first 2 weeks of their cycle prior to ovulation. The difference between risk of infection before and after ovulation relates to sex hormones produced at various points in the reproductive cycle. It seems that the estrogen that is produced prior to ovulation provides a somewhat protective, although certainly not absolute, role against HIV infection. For women who do become infected with HIV, studies have shown that women in the first 3 to 5 years after HIV infection carry lower HIV viral loads than men, perhaps due to the influence of estrogen. This suggests a major role for sex hormones in the infection and progression of HIV.\n37.

        "Solution": "38. The correct answer is $\\mathbf{A}$. This question requires you to know some of the details of the female reproductive cycle including what hormones are involved following ovulation. Prior to ovulation, both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary and are involved in follicular growth and maturation. The secretion of both FSH and LH is stimulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone $(\\mathrm{GnRH})$ from the hypothalamus. As the follicles grow and mature, they produce estrogen. During the second week of the cycle, increasing estrogen levels cause a spike in LH levels, which causes ovulation. Recall that following ovulation, the remnant of the follicle that stays in the Answers and Explanations Passage VI Passage VII MCAT\n\novary is called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes both estrogen and progesterone, which inhibit the further release of FSH and LH. The question is asking about a unique hormone that causes increased risk of HIV following ovulation. Choices B and D can be eliminated because FSH and LH are hormones most active prior to ovulation. Choice $C$ is not appropriate since estrogen is secreted prior to and following ovulation. The only hormone that is unique to postovulation is progesterone, which makes choice A correct.",

The passage states that the delta-32 CCR5 mutation is protective against HIV infection. The question indicated that there are two different phenotypes noted within the delta-32 CCR5 mutation-one that offers near 100 percent protection against HIV infection and one that offers only partial protection. The best explanation for why two phenotypes (complete protection and partial protection) are observed would be that the delta-32 allele exhibits incomplete dominance. An individual that is homozygous for the allele (meaning he or she inherited two copies of the delta-32 allele) would have full protection, while an individual who is heterozygous (meaning he or she has one normal copy of the allele and one copy of the delta-32 allele) would have an intermediate phenotype (being partial protection). This is indicated by choice B. Since the question indicates that the differences in phenotype (protection) are related to the delta32 mutation, choices A and D can be eliminated as they suppose that something other than the allele is providing protection. Choice C suggests that epistasis is involved in masking the delta-32 allele. While this might sound remotely plausible, choice B is a much more likely explanation.",

Based on the fact that the number of nonculturable bacteria did not decrease over the time period shown, we can assume that this is unlikely to change over a longer time course.

The overuse of antibiotics puts pressure on bacteria that selects for the bacteria that have mutated to become resistant to antibiotics. The overuse of antibiotics eliminates the susceptible bacteria, which leaves only the resistant bacteria to multiple to large numbers. Choice A suggests that people become immune to antibiotics, which is false. Since antibiotics are designed to target bacteria, bacteria are the only things that can become resistant to antibiotics. Since antibiotics normally kill bacteria, choice D would not make sense since it suggests that the use of antibiotics would increase the populations of resident bacteria. Choice C just isn't logical.

The energy that is released is the enthalpy of formation of solid sodium chloride, which is also called the heat of formation. The reaction takes place in five elementary steps:\n\n1. Sodium is vaporized.\n$\\mathrm{Na}(s) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Na}(g)$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{rxn}}^{\\mathrm{O}}=92 \\mathrm{~kJ}$\n\n2.

Most of the energy that is given off is due to the formation of solid sodium chloride from the gaseous ions. In solid sodium chloride, each positive ion is surrounded by 6 negative ions, and each negative ion is surrounded by 6 positive ions in a cubic lattice array. The lattice energy of an ionic compound is a measure of the attractive forces between the ions. The higher the lattice energy, the stronger the attractions and the higher melting the solid. Lattice energies depend on the charge and on the size of the ions in the array. If the size is constant, increasing charge increases the lattice energy. If the charge is constant, increasing size lowers the lattice energy.\n\nSome lattice energies are given in the table.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{cc}\n\\hline Compound & Lattice Energy in kJ\/mole \\\\\n\\hline $\\mathrm{LiCl}$ & 834 \\\\\n$\\mathrm{KCl}$ & 701 \\\\\n$\\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ & 2481 \\\\\n$\\mathrm{MgO}_{\\mathrm{O}}$ & 3795 \\\\\n$\\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}$ & 2192 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}"

To answer this question, Answers and Explanations Passage III MCAT\n\nyou need to think about how the sperm cells in the testes would compare to other cells in the body. Sperm cells are haploid, and all are genetically different from each other and from other cells in the body. Because they are genetically different, they should express unique surface antigens. If the cells of the immune system were to contact the sperm, they would be perceived as foreign and could be subject to immune system attack, which would destroy the sperm. For this reason, the blood-testis barrier is required to keep the sperm away from the immune cells. The remaining choices do not make good sense. Sperm cells will eventually leave the reproductive system during ejaculation. It also would not make sense to indicate that the blood flow to the testes needs to be cut off. This would prevent oxygen and nutrient flow to the area. Preventing the sperm from moving to the epididymis before they are ready does not provide an explanation for why the sperm cells need to be kept separate from the cells of the immune system.",

        "Solution": "29. The correct answer is $\\mathrm{A}$. This question expects you to be able to consider how the kidneys are involved in regulating blood volume and blood pressure. Water that is reabsorbed in the nephrons returns to the bloodstream to increase plasma volume, which in turn increases blood pressure as the volume of blood increases. When the nephrons absorb more water to increase blood volume, the urine volume decreases. The two hormones aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone help increase the amount of water reabsorbed by nephrons, which in turn decreases urine volume. In order to reduce blood pressure, the kidneys can decrease the amount of water reabsorbed by the nephrons. The less water reabsorbed means there will be less blood volume and less blood pressure. This would ultimately increase urine volume. The question asks how the kidneys might try to reduce hypertension. This would mean that we want less water reabsorbed into the blood, which would decrease blood volume and blood pressure. To do this, urine volume would have to increase.",

Therefore, the more Sertoli cells, theoretically, the more sperm should be produced. The two groups of men in this study varied in their sperm count. We are told that group 1 subjects had a normal sperm count while group 2 participants were seeking infertility treatments due to a low sperm count. Based on this information, the men with the higher sperm count should have a higher number of Sertoli cells. This would be group 1.",

Keep in mind that the question says to consider the data from both groups, so we are looking for trends that are similar in groups 1 and 2. Choice A suggests a positive feedback relationship between FSH and LH. This would mean that as one of these hormones increases, so does the other. While this might be possible based on the group 1 data, it is not seen in the group 2 data. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ suggests a positive feedback relationship between testosterone and FSH. While this might be plausible for group 2 subjects, it is not for group 1 subjects. This leaves choice B. There is in fact a negative feedback relationship between inhibin-B and FSH. In groups 1 and 2, when inhibin-B was high, FSH was low. This suggests negative feedback. Since there is a relationship between some of these hormones, choice D can be eliminated.",

To answer this question, Answers and Explanations Passage III MCAT\n\nyou need to think about how the sperm cells in the testes would compare to other cells in the body. Sperm cells are haploid, and all are genetically different from each other and from other cells in the body. Because they are genetically different, they should express unique surface antigens. If the cells of the immune system were to contact the sperm, they would be perceived as foreign and could be subject to immune system attack, which would destroy the sperm. For this reason, the blood-testis barrier is required to keep the sperm away from the immune cells. The remaining choices do not make good sense. Sperm cells will eventually leave the reproductive system during ejaculation. It also would not make sense to indicate that the blood flow to the testes needs to be cut off. This would prevent oxygen and nutrient flow to the area. Preventing the sperm from moving to the epididymis before they are ready does not provide an explanation for why the sperm cells need to be kept separate from the cells of the immune system.",

These follicles produce estrogen, which exerts positive feedback on LH, whose levels begin to climb. When LH levels peak on the 14 th day of the cycle, the follicle ruptures, releasing the egg from the ovary and leaving the corpus luteum behind in the ovary. After ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes both estrogen and progesterone to inhibit GnRH. When GnRH is inhibited, FSH and LH will also be inhibited.

        "Solution": "38. The correct answer is $\\mathbf{A}$. This question requires you to know some of the details of the female reproductive cycle including what hormones are involved following ovulation. Prior to ovulation, both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary and are involved in follicular growth and maturation. The secretion of both FSH and LH is stimulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone $(\\mathrm{GnRH})$ from the hypothalamus. As the follicles grow and mature, they produce estrogen. During the second week of the cycle, increasing estrogen levels cause a spike in LH levels, which causes ovulation. Recall that following ovulation, the remnant of the follicle that stays in the Answers and Explanations Passage VI Passage VII MCAT\n\novary is called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes both estrogen and progesterone, which inhibit the further release of FSH and LH. The question is asking about a unique hormone that causes increased risk of HIV following ovulation. Choices B and D can be eliminated because FSH and LH are hormones most active prior to ovulation. Choice $C$ is not appropriate since estrogen is secreted prior to and following ovulation. The only hormone that is unique to postovulation is progesterone, which makes choice A correct.",

        "Solution": "40. The correct answer is B. To answer this question, you need to rely on your knowledge of genetics. The passage states that the delta-32 CCR5 mutation is protective against HIV infection. The question indicated that there are two different phenotypes noted within the delta-32 CCR5 mutation-one that offers near 100 percent protection against HIV infection and one that offers only partial protection. The best explanation for why two phenotypes (complete protection and partial protection) are observed would be that the delta-32 allele exhibits incomplete dominance. An individual that is homozygous for the allele (meaning he or she inherited two copies of the delta-32 allele) would have full protection, while an individual who is heterozygous (meaning he or she has one normal copy of the allele and one copy of the delta-32 allele) would have an intermediate phenotype (being partial protection). This is indicated by choice B. Since the question indicates that the differences in phenotype (protection) are related to the delta32 mutation, choices A and D can be eliminated as they suppose that something other than the allele is providing protection. Choice C suggests that epistasis is involved in masking the delta-32 allele. While this might sound remotely plausible, choice B is a much more likely explanation.",

        "Solution": "49. The correct answer is A. This question relies on a knowledge of dominant and recessive patterns of inheritance. Dominant alleles are expressed, even in the heterozygous individual. In this case, our example is a dominant allele that causes a fatal condition. Since every individual carrying a single allele of this type would likely not survive, we would expect the frequency of the allele to decrease over time. In contrast, disorders that follow recessive patterns of inheritance require two copies of the allele for expression. Those who are heterozygous do not express the disorder and thus would survive.",

        "Problem Statement": "Passage III\n\nAluminum is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust, but it is never found naturally as an element. Instead, it always appears naturally in its oxidized form as a hydroxide we call bauxite.\n\nBauxite occurs in three main forms. The forms vary in the number of molecules of water it takes for hydration and in the crystalline structure of the molecule. Gibbsite is a trihydrate form $\\left[\\operatorname{AI}(\\mathrm{OH})_{3}\\right]$. Bohmite and diaspore are monohydrates $[\\mathrm{AIO}(\\mathrm{OH})]$. Of the three, the main form that is mined is gibbsite. Bauxite may be hard or soft, and it comes in a variety of colors that range from white to red.\n\nBauxite is formed due to the weathering of alumina-bearing rocks. It often appears as an extensive blanket of ore and is usually mined using surface-mining techniques. By far the largest consumers of aluminum are the United States, Japan, and Germany, but except for a little in Texas and Arkansas, bauxite is nearly nonexistent there. The major producers of bauxite are Australia, which produces around 40 percent of the SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\n\nworld's supply, and Guinea, in West Africa. The United States gets much of its supply from Brazil and Jamaica.\n\nThe extraction of aluminum from bauxite requires three stages. First, the ore is mined. Then it is refined to recover alumina. Finally, the alumina is smelted to produce aluminum.\n\nThe mining is done via the open-cut method. Bulldozers remove the topsoil, and excavators or other types of power machinery are used to remove the underlying layer of bauxite. The bauxite may be washed to remove clay and other detritus.\n\nRefining is done via the Bayer refining process, named after its inventor, Karl Bayer. Ground bauxite is fed into a digester, where it is mixed with a caustic soda. The aluminum oxide reacts with the soda to form a solution of sodium aluminate and a precipitate of sodium aluminum silicate. The solution is separated from the silicate through washing and pumping, and the alumina is precipitated from the solution, where it appears as crystals of alumina hydrate. The crystals are washed again to remove any remaining solution. Then they are heated to remove water, leaving the gritty alumina.\n\nSmelting is done via the Hall-Heroult smelting process.

Poet laureate Nahum Tate rewrote King Lear, banishing the Fool entirely and giving the play a happy ending. His version was staged regularly from the 1680 s through the 18 th century.\n\nThomas Bowdler was, from all the evidence, a less likely editor. He was born in 1754 near Bath, England, to a wealthy family. He studied medicine but never really practiced, preferring to exercise philanthropy and to play chess, at which he was a master. In his retirement, he decided to try his hand at editorial work. Shakespeare's dramas were his first project. He added nothing to the texts, but by cutting and paraphrasing strove to remove anything that \"could give just offense to the religious and virtuous mind.\"\n\nThe result was a 10-volume expurgated version that was criticized widely, although hardly universally. The famed British poet Algernon Swinburne remarked that \"no man ever did better service to Shakespeare than the man who made it possible to put him into the hands of intelligent and imaginative children.\"\n\nThere is some indication that Bowdler's sister Harriet did the actual editing of Shakespeare's text. She was a poet and editor in her own right, and clearly more qualified than her brother to lay hands on the Bard of Avon. She may have published the expurgated edition anonymously before allowing her brother to take over the rights. If SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\n\nthis is so, it is unsurprising that Harriet would not have wanted her name on the book. If the original Shakespeare were truly objectionable, then it would have been doubly so for a well-bred, unmarried Englishwoman of the day.\n\nBowdler went on to create children's versions of the Old Testament and of Edward Gibbons's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, although neither achieved either the success or ridicule of his Shakespeare. Today, of course, we know Bowdler not for his good works, but instead for the eponym derived from his good name. To bowdlerize is to censor or amend a written work, often with a connotation of prudishness. The process for which Bowdler is known is one that continues to the present day, as texts deemed too difficult for today's high schoolers are \"dumbed-down,\" library editions of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn have the \"n-word\" blacked out, and middle-school productions of popular Broadway plays have all expletives deleted. We would be hard-pressed to say that we live in a prudish era, but some of the same impulses that drove Thomas and Harriet Bowdler still exist today.\n25. Given the information in the passage, if a bowdlerized version of Shakespeare were available to parents today, which of the following outcomes would MOST likely occur?",

Because the author makes the point that bowdlerization still occurs today, it is not likely that everyone would revile such a text (choice B) or see that it failed (choice D). More likely would be that it would receive some condemnation but also make some sales (choice A).

At the time of her birth, General Yd\u00edgoras Fuentes had just seized power, following the assassination of Colonel Castillo Armas.

At the time of her birth, General Yd\u00edgoras Fuentes had just seized power, following the assassination of Colonel Castillo Armas. The year she turned one, there was a failed coup by a military group, many of whom fled to the countryside and would return to lead the rebellion that would wax and wane for the next 36 years.\n\nGuatemala was divided into factions for that entire period, as military governments controlled the nation and guerilla groups controlled the countryside. At the same time, right-wing vigilantes led a campaign of torture and assassination, eliminating students and peasants they deemed to be allied with the guerillas.\n\nIn the countryside where Rigoberta lived, the battles were largely over control of farmland. Rigoberta's father was taken into custody and tortured when the army believed he had assisted in the assassination of a plantation owner. Following a rout of the guerillas by the army, the guerillas regrouped and began to take their fight to the capital, beginning a long series of assassinations of government figures.\n\nRigoberta, her father, and some of her siblings joined the Committee of the Peasant Union (CUC). In rapid succession, Rigoberta lost her brother, father, and mother to the army's own assassination squads.

In less than two weeks, the public outcry grew, and Lott resigned from his post as Senate majority leader.\n\nIn addition to their influence, popular bloggers are able to turn their sleuthing and private rants into dollars. Marketers looking for new and more effective ways to reach consumers are increasingly spending money on online advertising. By 2005 , it was estimated that $\\$ 100$ million dollars' worth of blogs ads were sold. One blogger in Kentucky uses his site, fark.com, to spread his brand of humor and is earning millions of dollars in ad revenue this year, thanks to the support of theme parks, shampoos, and nutrition bars. But this is predicted to be just the tip of the blogs profitability iceberg. Overall web advertising is expected to grow by 50 percent to $\\$ 23.6$ billion in 2010 ; much of that will make its way on to blogs.\n46.

The coverage of Senator Lott is an example of the expansion of what is considered to be newsworthy, not an example of how blogs are attracting advertisers and their money (choice A). There is no suggestion that the coverage was designed to do anything other than report on the news, so choice B is also incorrect. Since Lott resigned from his position as Speaker of the House, the story was not ineffective, eliminating choice C. Choice D is the correct answer because paragraph 3 clearly states that traditional media sources often don't cover what they deem to be controversial news stories, \"virtually ignoring\" Lott's remarks.\n\nPassage VIII",

Since autosomal inheritance is obvious, it is necessary to determine if the pattern is characteristic of a dominant or recessive condition. Recessive traits are notorious for \"skipping generations\" in pedigrees, which means that affected children often come from unaffected parents. To be affected, the individual must be homozygous recessive. The parents do not have the disease, but they are unknowing carriers (heterozygotes), which gives them a $25 \\%$ chance of having an affected offspring. In dominant autosomal inheritance, the affected individual can be homozygous dominant or heterozygous. This means that in order for a child to have the disease, the child must have inherited at least one mutated allele from his or her parent who also had the disease. The only exception would be if spontaneous mutation occurred. When affected individuals appear in each generation of a pedigree, dominance should be suspected.",

Looking at the number of embryos surviving, you should notice that all three groups treated with any dosage of L-NAME had decreased survival as compared to the control group. The passage explains that L-NAME is a NOS inhibitor. If the enzyme needed to convert L-arginine to NO does not work, then NO levels will be decreased. The data suggest that a decreased level of $\\mathrm{NO}$ provided by the L-NAME treatment is detrimental. Further, the higher the dose of L-NAME, the more inhibition of NOS and the less NO provided, led to a dose dependent decrease in survival that eliminates choice $\\mathrm{C}$ as an option. The passage also explains that SNP is a NO donor, which increases NO levels. According to the data provided for the SNP groups, a small increase in NO (seen in group 2) seems to increase embryo survival. However, as the SNP dose becomes larger (and the higher the level of NO provided), this will lead to decreased survival. The highest rates of survival were seen in the $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SNP group, and survival decreased with increased dosage of SNP. This would eliminate choice B since increasing levels of NOS would increase NO levels similar to SNP treatment. The data show that SNP treatment (which increases NO levels) is most detrimental to embryo survival. Choice D directly contradicts this. The best conclusion is that $\\mathrm{NO}$ is necessary for development, since the data showed that the NO inhibition leads to decreased survival. However, only a certain amount of NO is needed as high levels also lead to decreased rates of embryo survival.",

        "Solution": "28. The correct answer is B. All vaccines take time to work (often weeks before full immunity occurs), so waiting for an oral vaccine to pass through the digestive tract (which takes no more than a few hours) is not of major concern. This eliminates choice A. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ suggests that inflammation in the digestive tract might be a problem. Since the inflammatory response is expected as one of the nonspecific immune defenses, it is not of major concern. Since two choices have been eliminated, choice D is no longer an option. This leaves choice B as the correct response. Since the plant has been engineered to express proteins unique to the virus or bacterium being vaccinated against, it is possible that these proteins might be damaged in the stomach.

        "Problem Statement": "Passage $\\mathrm{V}$\n\nFor many years, researchers have been interested in developing edible vaccines that would provide protection against various bacterial and viral diseases. An edible vaccine is a genetically modified organism (GMO) that is created when genes from the bacteria or virus being vaccinated against are inserted into plant cells. As the plants grow, they produce proteins from the bacteria or virus that the researchers are attempting to vaccinate against. When a person eats the plant, the viral or bacteria proteins serve as antigens, which initiates a primary immune response.\n\nSome of the plants that are of interest in edible vaccine development are bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, rice, tobacco, and soybeans. While early research focused on growing crops that produced edible products such as bananas, the most recent research is focused on extracting material from the leaves and seeds of the plants, dehydrating it, and putting it into capsules that can be swallowed. This allows for a more predictable dosage of the vaccine and eliminates concerns that the crops containing the vaccine would be accidentally eaten by individuals who are not in need of the vaccine. The term edible vaccine has now been replaced with the term plantderived oral vaccine.\n\nThe development of plant-derived oral vaccines solves many problems associated with injectable vaccines. Because plant-derived oral vaccines are grown in crops, there is no problem with storage or refrigeration that is required of most traditional vaccines. These plant-derived vaccines also require no special training to administer. Additionally, when a vaccine is taken orally, it provides mucosal immunity due to the production of IgA antibodies by the immune system-in addition to systemic immunity. Since 90 percent of diseases enter the body through a mucus membrane, a vaccine that coerces mucosal immunity is of great benefit in the prevention of many diseases.\n29.

        "Problem Statement": "Passage VII\n\nThe process of quorum sensing is observed in a variety of species. It involves a system of communication between organisms that is dependent on population density. Bacteria are notorious for using quorum sensing (QS) via the secretion of secreted signaling molecules, called autoinducers (AI), to coordinate their gene expression once a threshold density of population is reached. Not only can bacteria communicate via QS within their species, but they can also cross-talk through QS between different species. In order to participate in quorum sensing, bacteria require a way to produce an autoinducer and a way to respond to autoinducers via binding to specific receptors.\n\nOne example of how bacteria use quorum sensing to their advantage is to regulate the gene expression of virulence factors. During infection, if a small number of bacteria were to express their virulence factors, this would largely have no impact on the host. Instead, bacteria wait until a quorum is reached in terms of population size, indicating that the population is large enough to express virulence factors. These virulence factors relate to such abilities as escaping the immune response, invasion, and spreading within the host.\n\nWe know that we are facing a current healthcare crisis related to the loss of effectiveness of many traditional types of antibiotics based on bacterial resistance. This provides a major impetus for identifying novel ways to target bacterial pathogens that avoid the use of antibiotics. Several chemical compounds and molecules have been identified as facilitators of quorum sensing inhibition. Typically, these factors can serve as signal-targeting enzymes or small-molecule inhibitors of signal synthases and receptors.\n42. Targets of traditional antibiotics include all of the following EXCEPT:",

        "Problem Statement": "Passage VIII\n\nGenetically modified (GM) foods contain DNA from more than one source. The goal of creating GM foods is to modify the organisms to express new and useful traits. A few examples involve engineering crops to be resistant to bacterial or viral infections, to be resistant to herbicides, to ripen more slowly, to survive extreme temperature changes, to contain vaccines, or to create crops that are more nutritious.\n\nOne GM food that has received media attention over the years is golden rice. This GM product was first introduced in 2000 and was engineered to provide carotene that is a precursor to vitamin $\\mathrm{A}$. The carotene in the rice provides the golden color. Vitamin A deficiency is a major problem in underdeveloped parts of the world, killing more than one million people a year, most of whom are children. This vitamin is critical for the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues, for vision, and for growth.\n\nRice plants normally produce carotene in the inedible parts of the plant. To be able to access and use the carotene, it was necessary to engineer the rice to produce it in the edible grains. In order to achieve this goal, two genes from daffodil plants, psy and $l y c$, and a bacterial gene called $c r t 1$ were added to the rice genome. These genes engineered a pathway that produces lycopene, which is eventually converted to carotene. Each of these genes was placed under the control of a grain-specific promoter so that the products were produced in the rice grains.\n\nWhile golden rice was produced to provide carotene, which the human body can convert into the essential vitamin A, the rice provided much less carotene than was anticipated. Golden rice 2, a modified version released in 2005, contains a much larger amount of carotene and, as such, is a better source of the vitamin. Field tests were conducted in 2009, and human consumption trials were completed in 2012. However, neither version has been grown in large-scale quantities at this time.\n43. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be produced in a variety of ways. In the case of golden rice, genes from the daffodil plant and bacteria were added to the rice genome.

The hormone-receptor complex then enters the nucleus where it acts to alter gene expression in the cell. Since the question is asking about nonsteroid, or peptide, hormones, choices A and B can be eliminated. Choice D can also be eliminated as this is not a plausible explanation. Nonsteroid hormones act as first messengers binding to their receptors on the cell membrane. The hormone itself does not enter the cell. The binding of the first messenger to the receptor causes a series of reactions in the cell that ultimately activate second messengers, such as cAMP. MCAT\n\nPractice Test 2",

After fertilization, the zygote (a diploid, fertilized egg) begins cleavage, which is rapid mitotic cell division. This results in a solid ball of cells. Eventually, the center of this structure hollows out to form a cavity. This stage of development is the blastocyst stage. Choice A can be eliminated because it suggests that a blastocyst is a solid ball of cells when it really is a hollowed-out structure. Choice B suggests a diploid, fertilized egg, which is actually called a zygote. Answers and Explanations MCAT\n\nChoice D suggests that there is a ball of cells that perform meiosis.

        "Solution": "25. The correct answer is D. This question relies on knowledge of the immune response. Interleukins are cytokines that are secreted during the process of clonal selection in primary immune responses. Since they are not specific toward any one particular antigen, choice A can be eliminated. Interferons are produced as nonspecific defenses against viral infections. Virally infected cells secrete interferons that are detected by neighboring cells. Secretion of interferons gives neighboring cells the chance to increase their immune defenses so that they do not become infected by the virus. Since interferons are nonspecific, their presence would not indicate immunity against a specific virus, which eliminates choice B. The components of the complement system circulate in the plasma and are activated by bacteria that may enter the blood. Activation of the complement system ultimately lyses and kills the bacterial cell. Since the question is asking about a virus, choice C can be eliminated because it deals with bacteria. This leaves choice $\\mathrm{D}$ as the correct response. The detection of antibodies against the viral antigen would indicate that specific defenses were initiated and that plasma cells were activated to secrete antibodies against the viral antigen that was presented by the vaccine.",

        "Solution": "26. The correct answer is $\\mathrm{B}$. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to amplify copies of target DNA, it would not help to get the viral or bacterial genes of interest into plant cells. This eliminates choice A. Choice $C$ suggests that the genes could be cloned into a bacterial cell and transferred to a plant cell by conjugation. Conjugation is unique to certain species of bacteria and occasionally is seen in fungi, but it does not happen in plants. So choice $C$ is eliminated. Choice D suggests that the genes of interest should be hybridized to the DNA of the plant. Since hybridization occurs between complementary base pairs, this would suggest that the DNA sequence of the gene of interest and the plant would have to be the same, which is not the case. This leaves choice B as the best option. Bacterial or viral genes can be spliced into plasmids. The plasmids serve as vectors to deliver the gene of interest to a variety of cell types, including plants.",

Activated cytotoxic T cells and plasma cells are inactivated once the antigen that they have been designed to fight has been eliminated. The basis of long-term immune system protection is the development of memory T and memory B cells (choice D). These memory cells are produced upon primary exposure to a specific antigen and have the ability to survive for years within the body.

Since the inflammatory response is expected as one of the nonspecific immune defenses, it is not of major concern. Since two choices have been eliminated, choice D is no longer an option.

        "Solution": "7. The correct answer is D. Sex-linked inheritance can be quickly eliminated as males and females seem to be equally affected based on the pedigree. Since autosomal inheritance is obvious, it is necessary to determine if the pattern is characteristic of a dominant or recessive condition. Recessive traits are notorious for \"skipping generations\" in pedigrees, which means that affected children often come from unaffected parents. To be affected, the individual must be homozygous recessive. The parents do not have the disease, but they are unknowing carriers (heterozygotes), which gives them a $25 \\%$ chance of having an affected offspring. In dominant autosomal inheritance, the affected individual can be homozygous dominant or heterozygous. This means that in order for a child to have the disease, the child must have inherited at least one mutated allele from his or her parent who also had the disease. The only exception would be if spontaneous mutation occurred. When affected individuals appear in each generation of a pedigree, dominance should be suspected.",

However, some of their gametes carry the mutation. Since the somatic cells do not have the mutated alleles, these individuals do not appear to have tuberous sclerosis. If a pedigree were to be constructed, it would show two unaffected parents producing a child with the disease. This would resemble autosomal recessive inheritance where \"skipping generations\" is typical.",

The passage explains that lidocaine is metabolized in the liver and produces two metabolites: monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. If we are comparing a person with normal liver function to one with compromised liver function, there will be a difference in how long it takes to clear lidocaine from the system. If the liver function is impaired, it is expected that lidocaine will stay in the plasma longer as it waits to be metabolized by the liver. Therefore, the plasma concentration of lidocaine in the liver-compromised patient should be higher after 1 hour than in the patient with normal liver function. The faster lidocaine is metabolized by the liver, the faster the metabolites would be expected to enter the plasma and ultimately be excreted by the kidneys. Choice $C$ is correct because it suggests that one of the metabolites of lidocaine, monoethylglycinexylidide, would be processed by the liver and kidneys more quickly in the normal patient as compared to the liver-impaired patient.",

Looking at the number of embryos surviving, you should notice that all three groups treated with any dosage of L-NAME had decreased survival as compared to the control group. The passage explains that L-NAME is a NOS inhibitor. If the enzyme needed to convert L-arginine to NO does not work, then NO levels will be decreased. The data suggest that a decreased level of $\\mathrm{NO}$ provided by the L-NAME treatment is detrimental. Further, the higher the dose of L-NAME, the more inhibition of NOS and the less NO provided, led to a dose dependent decrease in survival that eliminates choice $\\mathrm{C}$ as an option. The passage also explains that SNP is a NO donor, which increases NO levels. According to the data provided for the SNP groups, a small increase in NO (seen in group 2) seems to increase embryo survival. However, as the SNP dose becomes larger (and the higher the level of NO provided), this will lead to decreased survival. The highest rates of survival were seen in the $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SNP group, and survival decreased with increased dosage of SNP. This would eliminate choice B since increasing levels of NOS would increase NO levels similar to SNP treatment. The data show that SNP treatment (which increases NO levels) is most detrimental to embryo survival. Choice D directly contradicts this. The best conclusion is that $\\mathrm{NO}$ is necessary for development, since the data showed that the NO inhibition leads to decreased survival. However, only a certain amount of NO is needed as high levels also lead to decreased rates of embryo survival.",

Interleukins are cytokines that are secreted during the process of clonal selection in primary immune responses. Since they are not specific toward any one particular antigen, choice A can be eliminated. Interferons are produced as nonspecific defenses against viral infections. Virally infected cells secrete interferons that are detected by neighboring cells. Secretion of interferons gives neighboring cells the chance to increase their immune defenses so that they do not become infected by the virus. Since interferons are nonspecific, their presence would not indicate immunity against a specific virus, which eliminates choice B. The components of the complement system circulate in the plasma and are activated by bacteria that may enter the blood. Activation of the complement system ultimately lyses and kills the bacterial cell. Since the question is asking about a virus, choice C can be eliminated because it deals with bacteria. This leaves choice $\\mathrm{D}$ as the correct response.

Shallow acting requires altering facial expressions and body language so that on the surface, the individual conveys an emotion or opinion to conform to the social situation but does not really experience that emotion\/opinion. Deep acting requires alteration of inner beliefs such that the individual believes the emotion or opinion he or she is expressing in order to conform to the situation.\n\nIn one study, deep acting and shallow acting in a social situation were examined for customer-service workers.

Sea beans are those plants whose seeds, buoyed by a pocket of air, float on the tide from one island to another, or even across vast stretches of ocean. Ballast waifs are less natural in origin; they are seeds that arrive on one shore from another in the soil placed in a ship's hold as ballast.\n\nOne remarkably lovely and dreadfully damaging ballast waif is Lythrum salicaria, the bright purple, spiky flower known commonly as purple loosestrife. Purple loosestrife is not a newcomer to U.S. shores; it arrived from Eurasia, almost certainly via ship, some 200 years ago. It was widely used for medicinal and ornamental purposes throughout the 19th century. Its lovely purple blooms may still be seen in gardens throughout the country, where people love it for its long growing season.\n\nFor all its beauty, purple loosestrife is a menace.

Like many wars of the 19th century, it was declared not by Parliament but rather by people on the scene. Sir Henry Bartle Frere was an emissary of the Queen, sent to Cape Town to find a way to unify the British and Boer colonies with a variety of independent black states to form a Confederation of South Africa. Standing in his way was the Zulu Army, a robust contingent of 40,000 warriors under the leadership of King Cetshwayo.\n\nFrere looked for a way to seize Zululand. He used a series of minor border disputes to prompt an ultimatum to Cetshwayo, demanding that his army disband and be remodeled within 30 days. Cetshwayo refused to reply, which led to a state of war. A month and a half later, a British force invaded Zululand. They moved in three columns toward the royal compound.\n\nOn the 22nd of January, the middle column, led by Lord Chelmsford, a favorite of the Queen, split, with Chelmsford leading a large force to support a small reconnoitering party. The 1,750 left at camp soon found themselves surrounded by nearly 20,000 Zulus. Notice was sent to Chelmsford, but he would not be deflected from his plan. The resulting massacre at Isandhlwana reduced the middle column by 1,350 men. Some SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\n\nof the survivors retreated to Rorke's Drift, where they joined a small force of about 100 men who had successfully held off a few thousand warriors.\n\nNews of the massacre made its way to England, but Chelmsford, quite the modern military man, had already put a cover-up in place. He managed to convince the Queen and some of the press that Isandhlwana was overcome due to a lack of ammunition, and he put forth Rorke's Drift as a major victory, allowing that minor skirmish to be glorified as the massacre was all but forgotten. He would later blame Isandhlwana on the disobedience of an officer who died there.\n\nChelmsford's self-supporting propaganda was effective for a while, but as the Zulu War turned even bloodier, albeit more successful for the British, he was eventually recalled and replaced by Field Marshal Wolseley. Wolseley would command the British troops through the final campaigns of the Zulu War, campaigns that culminated in the capture of King Cetshwayo. The British divided up Cetshwayo's kingdom into 13 minichiefdoms, granting 11 to Zulus, 1 to a pro-British Basuto chief, and 1 to a white African mercenary. This plan led to many years of civil war, and in 1882, the British restored Cetshwayo to his throne, leaving his son in charge of a nearby territory. In 1883 that son joined with a band of Boer mercenaries and invaded his father's kraal, forcing his father into exile, where he soon died under mysterious circumstances.

        "Problem Statement": "Passage III\n\nIn the history of preemptive wars that end badly, we must consider the Zulu War of 1879. Like many wars of the 19th century, it was declared not by Parliament but rather by people on the scene. Sir Henry Bartle Frere was an emissary of the Queen, sent to Cape Town to find a way to unify the British and Boer colonies with a variety of independent black states to form a Confederation of South Africa. Standing in his way was the Zulu Army, a robust contingent of 40,000 warriors under the leadership of King Cetshwayo.\n\nFrere looked for a way to seize Zululand. He used a series of minor border disputes to prompt an ultimatum to Cetshwayo, demanding that his army disband and be remodeled within 30 days. Cetshwayo refused to reply, which led to a state of war. A month and a half later, a British force invaded Zululand. They moved in three columns toward the royal compound.\n\nOn the 22nd of January, the middle column, led by Lord Chelmsford, a favorite of the Queen, split, with Chelmsford leading a large force to support a small reconnoitering party. The 1,750 left at camp soon found themselves surrounded by nearly 20,000 Zulus. Notice was sent to Chelmsford, but he would not be deflected from his plan. The resulting massacre at Isandhlwana reduced the middle column by 1,350 men. Some SECTION 4:\n\nCritical\n\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\n\nof the survivors retreated to Rorke's Drift, where they joined a small force of about 100 men who had successfully held off a few thousand warriors.\n\nNews of the massacre made its way to England, but Chelmsford, quite the modern military man, had already put a cover-up in place. He managed to convince the Queen and some of the press that Isandhlwana was overcome due to a lack of ammunition, and he put forth Rorke's Drift as a major victory, allowing that minor skirmish to be glorified as the massacre was all but forgotten. He would later blame Isandhlwana on the disobedience of an officer who died there.\n\nChelmsford's self-supporting propaganda was effective for a while, but as the Zulu War turned even bloodier, albeit more successful for the British, he was eventually recalled and replaced by Field Marshal Wolseley. Wolseley would command the British troops through the final campaigns of the Zulu War, campaigns that culminated in the capture of King Cetshwayo. The British divided up Cetshwayo's kingdom into 13 minichiefdoms, granting 11 to Zulus, 1 to a pro-British Basuto chief, and 1 to a white African mercenary. This plan led to many years of civil war, and in 1882, the British restored Cetshwayo to his throne, leaving his son in charge of a nearby territory. In 1883 that son joined with a band of Boer mercenaries and invaded his father's kraal, forcing his father into exile, where he soon died under mysterious circumstances.

Atomistic thinkers, such as Descartes and Wittgenstein, believe that the whole is no more than the sum of its parts. A thorough study of these parts, atomists believe, will lead to an understanding of the whole. A contrasting view, held by Schelling, Hegel (although some scholars question whether Hegel's ontology actually conforms to this formalist conception of totality), and members of the structuralist school of philosophy, holds that the whole has an identity of its own, separate from the nature of its component parts. A third view, and perhaps the most challenging to explore, is the dialectical\/materialist idea of the whole held by Karl Marx. In this view, the whole is seen not simply as the sum of its parts as atomists believe or as something independent of its parts according to formalist thought. Instead, the whole is conceived of as the constantly changing and evolving interactions between all of its component parts.\n\nIn Marx's view, there are no things\u2014static, independent objects or ideas-there are only processes. Everything that makes up the world is constantly in the process of becoming, with both its past and its future encapsulated in the very notion of the object itself. Furthermore, according to the dialectical materialist view, all objects are interdependent and the interactions they have with each other are also parts of their totalities.\n\nCritics of this perspective point out, somewhat justifiably, that such an ontology has a number of difficulties. One of their major objections is that dialectical materialism is impractical to employ in any meaningful way. Consider how thinking of even a simple object such as a chair in this way quickly leads to a surfeit of information, connections, and processes. For a chair is not simply a chair, but the result of the labor of an individual, a process of manufacturing, the needs of a society that requires chairs, and many other factors. And each of these factors has its own past (and future) and myriad other connections as well. The number of relationships increases exponentially, which quickly makes a dialectical worldview utterly overwhelming to even the most agile philosophical mind.\n\nMarxist philosophers attempt to work around this potential pathology by invoking what is called the process of abstraction. Abstraction allows the philosopher to draw certain boundaries around the object, idea, or relationship studied. Typically, these abstractions involve deciding an appropriate time scale to consider, the level of generality necessary for understanding specific interactions, and the vantage point from which to view a particular object of study. Abstraction on these levels allows the philosopher to bring certain relationships and processes into greater focus in order to understand them, while always keeping in mind that such an abstraction necessarily obscures various other connections. Marx famously used this process in his study of capitalism, sometimes viewing the system from the vantage point of the capitalist, other times assuming the perch of the worker, and even at times trying to view the system from the perspective of capital itself. Similarly, sometimes Marx generalized people as simply members of their class in order to gain a better grasp of the relationship between owner and worker.

Mitochondrial DNA is circular and consists of 37 genes coding for proteins, transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Each mitochondrion has about five copies of the mtDNA. All of the mitochondria within the body's cells are descendants of the mitochondria present in an egg cell before it was fertilized.

During osmosis, water always moves from the side of the membrane that has more water to the side of the membrane that has less water. The only thing that moves by osmosis is water. This means that choice B can be eliminated because solutes are not moving by osmosis. If there is a concentration difference across the membrane, there will be water movement, which eliminates choice $\\mathrm{C}$. When osmosis occurs, water moves from the side of the membrane that has more water to the side that has less water.

This question requires you to locate the most logical explanation as to why antibiotic genes are often purposefully transferred along with a gene of interest in biotechnology procedures. Because the question does not provide information on what type of cells are being transformed, don't assume anything. Choice A suggests that you need resistance genes transferred so the cells can survive in the presence of antibiotics. If the cells transformed are not bacterial, they would survive anyway, as antibiotics would target and kill only bacteria. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ suggests that the antibiotic genes are transferred out of convenience because they happen to be near the gene of interest. If the gene of interest is not coming from bacteria, then there could not be any antibiotic resistance genes nearby. Choice D really doesn't offer much in the way of logic, suggesting that antibiotic resistance would be necessary to prevent infection in transformed cells. The only logical explanation is choice B. In order to determine if a cell was transformed with the gene of interest or not, antibiotics could be added. The transformed cells that picked up the gene of interest would also pick up the antibiotic resistance marker and would grow in the presence of antibiotics.

Within the myelin sheath there are gaps, known as nodes of Ranvier, where the myelin is absent. Action potentials move down the axon and jump from one node to the next. When the myelin is removed, the gap from one node to the next becomes so large that the action potential can no longer jump the gap.

Choice $\\mathrm{B}$ suggests that the problem is with the response of muscle cells to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. If the action potential never reaches the end of the neuron, acetylcholine will not be released to the neuromuscular junction; therefore, the issue is not with the muscle cells' response.

        "Solution": "50. The correct answer is A. To answer this question, you need to be familiar with mechanisms used in the body to maintain calcium homeostasis and bone cell action. The hormones calcitonin and parathyroid hormone both regulate blood calcium levels. Calcitonin, secreted by the thyroid gland, decreases blood calcium by storing excess calcium in bone matrix due to the activity of osteoblasts. Parathyroid hormone, secreted by the parathyroid glands located on top of the thyroid, is antagonistic to calcitonin and increases blood calcium levels. Osteoblasts are bone cells that build bone tissue when there is excess calcium. Their activity is regulated by calcitonin. When active, osteoblasts reduce blood calcium levels. Osteoclasts break down bone tissue and are regulated by parathyroid hormone. When active, osteoclasts increase blood calcium levels. If a patient has had his or her thyroid and parathyroids removed, it would be safe to assume that calcitonin and parathyroid levels would be decreased, making it difficult to regulate blood calcium levels. Choice B suggests that activating osteoblasts would help increase calcium levels. Because osteoblasts build bone and decrease blood calcium, this would actually further decrease the calcium levels in the blood. Taking synthetic calcitonin as suggested by choices $C$ and $D$ would only decrease calcium levels further because calcitonin activates osteoblasts. One potential solution to increase blood calcium levels would be to increase bone matrix breakdown as suggested by choice A. Osteoclasts are the bone cells responsible for this response.",

This question requires you to locate the most logical explanation as to why antibiotic genes are often purposefully transferred along with a gene of interest in biotechnology procedures. Because the question does not provide information on what type of cells are being transformed, don't assume anything. Choice A suggests that you need resistance genes transferred so the cells can survive in the presence of antibiotics. If the cells transformed are not bacterial, they would survive anyway, as antibiotics would target and kill only bacteria. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ suggests that the antibiotic genes are transferred out of convenience because they happen to be near the gene of interest. If the gene of interest is not coming from bacteria, then there could not be any antibiotic resistance genes nearby. Choice D really doesn't offer much in the way of logic, suggesting that antibiotic resistance would be necessary to prevent infection in transformed cells. The only logical explanation is choice B. In order to determine if a cell was transformed with the gene of interest or not, antibiotics could be added. The transformed cells that picked up the gene of interest would also pick up the antibiotic resistance marker and would grow in the presence of antibiotics.

        "Solution": "42. The correct answer is $\\mathbf{A}$. The myelin sheath is used to insulate the axons of neurons. Within the myelin sheath there are gaps, known as nodes of Ranvier, where the myelin is absent. Action potentials move down the axon and jump from one node to the next. When the myelin is removed, the gap from one node to the next becomes so large that the action potential can no longer jump the gap.

Choice $\\mathrm{B}$ suggests that the problem is with the response of muscle cells to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. If the action potential never reaches the end of the neuron, acetylcholine will not be released to the neuromuscular junction; therefore, the issue is not with the muscle cells' response. The sodium-potassium pumps are used to maintain resting potential in neurons, and there is nothing in the passage or question that would indicate that there is a problem with this.

        "Solution": "50. The correct answer is A. To answer this question, you need to be familiar with mechanisms used in the body to maintain calcium homeostasis and bone cell action. The hormones calcitonin and parathyroid hormone both regulate blood calcium levels. Calcitonin, secreted by the thyroid gland, decreases blood calcium by storing excess calcium in bone matrix due to the activity of osteoblasts. Parathyroid hormone, secreted by the parathyroid glands located on top of the thyroid, is antagonistic to calcitonin and increases blood calcium levels. Osteoblasts are bone cells that build bone tissue when there is excess calcium. Their activity is regulated by calcitonin. When active, osteoblasts reduce blood calcium levels. Osteoclasts break down bone tissue and are regulated by parathyroid hormone. When active, osteoclasts increase blood calcium levels. If a patient has had his or her thyroid and parathyroids removed, it would be safe to assume that calcitonin and parathyroid levels would be decreased, making it difficult to regulate blood calcium levels. Choice B suggests that activating osteoblasts would help increase calcium levels. Because osteoblasts build bone and decrease blood calcium, this would actually further decrease the calcium levels in the blood. Taking synthetic calcitonin as suggested by choices $C$ and $D$ would only decrease calcium levels further because calcitonin activates osteoblasts. One potential solution to increase blood calcium levels would be to increase bone matrix breakdown as suggested by choice A. Osteoclasts are the bone cells responsible for this response.",

The thyroid gland itself produces T3 and T4 that could be involved with hyperthyroidism, thus eliminating choice C. The thyroid is regulated by thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, which eliminates choice B. The anterior pituitary gland is regulated by hormones from the hypothalamus, eliminating choice A. Therefore, the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, and thyroid gland all could potentially have a role in a thyroid problem.

Increasing the production of the mutated CFTR would not improve the condition. The passage indicates that some mutations of CFTR produce proteins that are misdirected and destroyed instead of being sent to the cell membrane. A drug that stops the destruction of CFTR might sound helpful; but if it doesn't also get the CFTR to the membrane where it is needed, it won't be beneficial. Increasing nutrient absorption in the small intestine would be helpful in countering some of the malnutrition problems that cystic fibrosis patients often have.

        "Solution": "31. The correct answer is $\\mathrm{D}$. Oncogenes develop when a proto-oncogene activates. In order for a virus to carry an oncogene into its host, that virus must be derived from a virus that picked up the gene from a former host cell. Spontaneous mutation alone could not account for a virus acquiring an entire proto-oncogene, which eliminates choice A. Viruses do not conjugate, so choice B can be eliminated as well. Transformation occurs when a cell incorporates foreign DNA from its environment into its own genome. This occurs with bacteria but not viruses, meaning that choice $\\mathrm{C}$ can also be eliminated. This leaves transduction as the only choice. When a virus excises from the host chromosome, it can take with it genes from the host's chromosome. A virus could feasibly acquire an activated oncogene when excising from its host, and this gene could be transferred to a new host.",

This question requires you to locate the most logical explanation as to why antibiotic genes are often purposefully transferred along with a gene of interest in biotechnology procedures. Because the question does not provide information on what type of cells are being transformed, don't assume anything. Choice A suggests that you need resistance genes transferred so the cells can survive in the presence of antibiotics. If the cells transformed are not bacterial, they would survive anyway, as antibiotics would target and kill only bacteria. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ suggests that the antibiotic genes are transferred out of convenience because they happen to be near the gene of interest. If the gene of interest is not coming from bacteria, then there could not be any antibiotic resistance genes nearby. Choice D really doesn't offer much in the way of logic, suggesting that antibiotic resistance would be necessary to prevent infection in transformed cells. The only logical explanation is choice B. In order to determine if a cell was transformed with the gene of interest or not, antibiotics could be added. The transformed cells that picked up the gene of interest would also pick up the antibiotic resistance marker and would grow in the presence of antibiotics.

When the myelin is removed, the gap from one node to the next becomes so large that the action potential can no longer jump the gap.

Choice $\\mathrm{B}$ suggests that the problem is with the response of muscle cells to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. If the action potential never reaches the end of the neuron, acetylcholine will not be released to the neuromuscular junction; therefore, the issue is not with the muscle cells' response.

        "Solution": "50. The correct answer is A. To answer this question, you need to be familiar with mechanisms used in the body to maintain calcium homeostasis and bone cell action. The hormones calcitonin and parathyroid hormone both regulate blood calcium levels. Calcitonin, secreted by the thyroid gland, decreases blood calcium by storing excess calcium in bone matrix due to the activity of osteoblasts. Parathyroid hormone, secreted by the parathyroid glands located on top of the thyroid, is antagonistic to calcitonin and increases blood calcium levels. Osteoblasts are bone cells that build bone tissue when there is excess calcium. Their activity is regulated by calcitonin. When active, osteoblasts reduce blood calcium levels. Osteoclasts break down bone tissue and are regulated by parathyroid hormone. When active, osteoclasts increase blood calcium levels. If a patient has had his or her thyroid and parathyroids removed, it would be safe to assume that calcitonin and parathyroid levels would be decreased, making it difficult to regulate blood calcium levels. Choice B suggests that activating osteoblasts would help increase calcium levels. Because osteoblasts build bone and decrease blood calcium, this would actually further decrease the calcium levels in the blood. Taking synthetic calcitonin as suggested by choices $C$ and $D$ would only decrease calcium levels further because calcitonin activates osteoblasts. One potential solution to increase blood calcium levels would be to increase bone matrix breakdown as suggested by choice A. Osteoclasts are the bone cells responsible for this response.",

        "Problem Statement": "Passage II\n\nIn sharp contrast to the modern, confessional poetry of the 20th century, the oeuvre of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow seems quaint and primly Victorian. During his lifetime, however, he was the most celebrated poet in the country. A closer look at the history of American poetry reveals that, despite his eminence, Longfellow wrote in a mold of both form and content that was already being challenged during his lifetime. But why, a century later, do the artistic works of many of his contemporaries continue to be enjoyed and studied while Longfellow languishes in the tomb of cultural artifacts?\n\nOne answer lies in the radical shift that began to take place in poetry in the mid19th century. Longfellow's themes and steadfast rhymes (and those of John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell) gave way gradually to confessional verse, whose subjects were more personal and rhymes were looser and less conventional. But to understand this shift, one must first understand the nature of Longfellow's work and his standing in the American literary scene of his time.\n\nLongfellow took as his subject his country's historical imagination, writing on an epic scale about Paul Revere, the Indian Hiawatha, and the pilgrim Miles Standish. He bestowed a mythic dimension on these figures, giving American readers iconic images that helped form a collective consciousness in the new country (indeed, Longfellow was a part of the first generation to be born in the United States). But Longfellow's content went beyond nationalistic pride-it was highly accessible and incredibly popular. Its accessibility is explained by his obvious themes that could be easily understood and embraced by the public. Longfellow did not challenge his readers, but appealed to their desire for stories that expounded an optimistic, sentimental, and moralistic worldview. Those themes were explored in rhyme that allowed readers to commit the poems to memory, much like songs. In 1857, The Song of Hiawatha, arguably his bestknown poem, sold 50,000 copies, an astounding number at the time. The next year, The Courtship of Miles Standish sold 25,000 copies in two months and in London sold 10,000 copies in one day. His success allowed him to give up a professorship at Harvard and focus full time on his writing.\n\nWalt Whitman, Longfellow's contemporary, wrote poetry similar to that of Longfellow-romantic and sentimental, with conventional rhyme and meter. But in the 1850s, indeed two years before The Song of Hiawatha, he wrote and published Leaves of Grass; a more radical departure from his previous work could not have been imagined. The 12 unnamed poems comprising Leaves of Grass are written in free verse-that is, without conventional rhyme and meter. Yet, like Longfellow, he was determined to explore the subject of America and his love for his country.\n\nWhitman looked to the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson for inspiration. Emerson wrote \"America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography dazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for metres.\" Indeed, Whitman paraphrased Emerson in his preface. Whitman's groundbreaking free verse changed the trajectory of American poetry. The next generation of poets, including Ezra Pound, Hart Crane, Sherwood Anderson, and William Carlos Williams, celebrated their debt to Whitman.

        "Problem Statement": "Passage II\n\nIn sharp contrast to the modern, confessional poetry of the 20th century, the oeuvre of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow seems quaint and primly Victorian. During his lifetime, however, he was the most celebrated poet in the country. A closer look at the history of American poetry reveals that, despite his eminence, Longfellow wrote in a mold of both form and content that was already being challenged during his lifetime. But why, a century later, do the artistic works of many of his contemporaries continue to be enjoyed and studied while Longfellow languishes in the tomb of cultural artifacts?\n\nOne answer lies in the radical shift that began to take place in poetry in the mid19th century. Longfellow's themes and steadfast rhymes (and those of John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell) gave way gradually to confessional verse, whose subjects were more personal and rhymes were looser and less conventional. But to understand this shift, one must first understand the nature of Longfellow's work and his standing in the American literary scene of his time.\n\nLongfellow took as his subject his country's historical imagination, writing on an epic scale about Paul Revere, the Indian Hiawatha, and the pilgrim Miles Standish. He bestowed a mythic dimension on these figures, giving American readers iconic images that helped form a collective consciousness in the new country (indeed, Longfellow was a part of the first generation to be born in the United States). But Longfellow's content went beyond nationalistic pride-it was highly accessible and incredibly popular. Its accessibility is explained by his obvious themes that could be easily understood and embraced by the public. Longfellow did not challenge his readers, but appealed to their desire for stories that expounded an optimistic, sentimental, and moralistic worldview. Those themes were explored in rhyme that allowed readers to commit the poems to memory, much like songs. In 1857, The Song of Hiawatha, arguably his bestknown poem, sold 50,000 copies, an astounding number at the time. The next year, The Courtship of Miles Standish sold 25,000 copies in two months and in London sold 10,000 copies in one day. His success allowed him to give up a professorship at Harvard and focus full time on his writing.\n\nWalt Whitman, Longfellow's contemporary, wrote poetry similar to that of Longfellow-romantic and sentimental, with conventional rhyme and meter. But in the 1850s, indeed two years before The Song of Hiawatha, he wrote and published Leaves of Grass; a more radical departure from his previous work could not have been imagined. The 12 unnamed poems comprising Leaves of Grass are written in free verse-that is, without conventional rhyme and meter.

Whitman's groundbreaking free verse changed the trajectory of American poetry. The next generation of poets, including Ezra Pound, Hart Crane, Sherwood Anderson, and William Carlos Williams, celebrated their debt to Whitman. Decades later, the influence of Whitman's work on Allen Ginsberg and Langston Hughes, among many others, continues his legacy.\n7.

To answer it, first note the hypothesis as stated in the question stem: Whitman was responsible for the radical shift in American poetry. Then determine which statements support it and which one does not. The one that does not is the correct answer. The fact that his poetry was personal and intimate (choice B) supports the hypothesis, as does his use of free verse (choice D). Choice C, choosing as his subjects the common man and commonplace events, also supports the hypothesis. Nowhere in the passage does it state that Whitman used iconic American figures as his subjects; in fact, that is what Longfellow did, and his poetry was what Whitman's shifted away from.

        "Problem Statement": "\\section{Passage $\\mathrm{V}$}\n\nEngineers and computer scientists are intrigued by the potential power of nanocomputing. Nanocomputers will use atoms and molecules to perform their functions instead of the standard integrated circuits now employed. Theorists believe that the amount of information a nanocomputer could handle is staggering.\n\nA professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has attempted to calculate the computational limits of a computer with a weight of 1 kilogram and a volume of 1 liter. According to the laws of physics, the potential amount of computational power is a function of the available energy. Basically, each atom and subatomic particle in the computer has an amount of energy attached to it. Furthermore, the energy of each particle or atom is increased by the frequency of its movement. Thus the power of a computer that uses nanotechnology is bounded by the energy available from its atoms.\n\nSpecifically, the relationship between the energy of an object and its computation potential is a proportionate one. As Einstein has famously calculated, the energy of an object is equal to its mass times the speed of light squared. Thus, a theoretical computer weighing a mere kilogram has a huge amount of potential energy. To find the total computational power, the minimum amount of energy required to perform an operation is divided by the total amount of energy. \n\nof energy possessed by a 1-kilogram computer by Planck's constant yields a tremendously large number, roughly $5 \\times 10^{50}$ operations per second. Using even the most conservative estimates of the computing power of the human brain, such a computer would have the computational power of five trillion trillion human civilizations. The computer would also have a memory capacity, calculated by determining the degrees of freedom allowed by the state of all the particles comprising it, of $10^{31} \\mathrm{bits}$.\n\nThese numbers are purely theoretical, however. Were the computer to convert all of its mass to energy, it would be the equivalent of a thermonuclear explosion. And it is unreasonable to expect human technology to ever achieve abilities even close to these limits. However, a project at the University of Oklahoma has succeeded in storing 50 bits of data per atom, albeit on only a limited number of atoms. Given that there are $10^{25}$ atoms in 1 kilogram of material, it may be possible to fit up to $10^{27}$ bits of information in the computer. And if scientists are able to exploit the many properties of atoms to store information, including the position, spin, and quantum state of all its particles, it may be possible to exceed even that number.\n\nOne interesting consequence of such staggering increases in computing power is that each advance could provide the basis for further evolution. Once technology can achieve, for instance, a level of computation equal to $10^{40}$ operations per second, it can use that massive power to help bring the theoretical limit ever closer.\n30.

Furthermore, the passage states that English is unlike many IndoEuropean languages in its use of the stem form as a word. From this information, a linguist may conclude that Russian might (but not necessarily) be part of the Indo-European family. Just because the stem forms are not pronounced gives no information on the number of forms, as choice A states. Choice $C$ is not a valid inference based on the information in the passage. The lack of pronounced stem verbs says nothing about the number of inflections, which are the ways a word changes when taking on different roles in the sentence.\n\nPassage VII",

Some thought the switch in loyalties was sour grapes, but others saw Alfred E. Smith as the epitome of William Wordsworth's \"happy warrior\" and therefore a man who \"makes his moral being his prime care\"-one who never made a move without consulting his conscience.\n\nAlfred E. Smith was both a successful politician and an unsuccessful one. A fourterm governor of New York State, he seemed a sure candidate for president, and indeed he ran three times for that position, only to lose each time.\n\nHe had several strikes against him. He was the Catholic son of Irish and ItalianGerman immigrants, making him anathema to nativists, the xenophobes who underwent a resurgence in the 1920s. He was from New York City, viewed even in the early twentieth century as disconnected from the national character. He was a progressive, which made conservatives of all stripes nervous. And he favored the repeal of Prohibition, a position that lost him the backing of many party leaders.\n\nWho was this unlikely candidate? Born Alfred Emanuel Smith in 1873, Smith grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His father died when Smith was young, and the boy dropped out of school to take care of the family. At age 21, Smith supported a losing candidate in a local race and came to the attention of New York politicos, who took him under their wing. Nine years later, he ran successfully for the New York State Assembly, where he rapidly rose in the ranks to become Majority Leader and finally Speaker. He played a pivotal role in the revamping of New York's constitution, was elected sheriff of New York County, and then ran for governor in 1918, winning handily. Although he lost a re-election bid two years later, he surged back in 1922 and would remain in the governor's seat for six more years. His terms were marked by unparalleled improvements in labor laws and laws protecting civil liberties, for Smith's goal was to support those he saw as most in need of government's assistance.\n\nIn this goal, he was allied with Franklin Roosevelt, and the two were close enough that Roosevelt nominated Smith for president in 1924. The Drys, or Prohibitionists, backed William McAdoo, a son-in-law of former President Woodrow Wilson. Smith's supporters and McAdoo's supporters were so far apart that finally a compromise candidate, John Davis, was nominated and promptly lost the general election to Calvin Coolidge.\n\nIn 1928, Smith received his party's nomination on the second ballot, but along with his anti-Prohibition leanings, his religion became a major issue during the campaign, paving the way for Herbert Hoover to win the general election. Meanwhile, Smith had arranged for the nomination of his New York colleague, Franklin Roosevelt, to be governor of New York. Although Smith lost his bid, Roosevelt did not. Then came the Depression and the election of 1932. Backroom dealings ensured that Franklin Roosevelt won the nominating process, with another would-be presidential candidate in the vice-presidential spot on the ticket. Smith was left out in the cold on his third try for the presidency. Despite his former regard for Roosevelt, he began to work hard, if unsuccessfully, to defeat the New Deal. He supported two Republicans rather than Roosevelt in the 1936 and 1940 elections, and he died in 1944, a man who had never reached his desired goal, yet had inspired many of the changes for which his rival is now known.\n38.

He supported two Republicans rather than Roosevelt in the 1936 and 1940 elections, and he died in 1944, a man who had never reached his desired goal, yet had inspired many of the changes for which his rival is now known.\n44.

Authors rarely include information without a reason, and the MCAT often asks you to identify and assess the reasons behind the inclusion of a passage or phrase. Here, Orozco's art is discussed in its relation to politics, from his Holy Trinity of workers to his political cartoons. Although choice B might be correct in a different context, choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is the better answer.",

        "Problem Statement": "Passage IX\n\nMuralism has long been a Mexican tradition, perhaps dating back to the Aztecs, who recorded their history on the walls of their pyramids. The covering of a white wall with political art made the careers of David Alfara Siqueiros, Jose Clemente Orozco, and the best known of them all, Diego Rivera.\n\nSiqueiros, born in Chihuahua, studied art from an early age. He organized a student strike at the age of 15 and later worked to unseat the Mexican dictator Huerta, attaining the rank of captain during the revolution that was taking place. He later brought his tactical knowledge to the world of organized labor, where his activism led to lengthy jail terms. That is where he created some of his finest artworks on canvas. During the 1930s, he went to Spain to join the anti-fascist forces. His life was that of a soldier-artist, and some considered him a dangerous, subversive gangster.\n\nOrozco, too, studied art as a youth and was inspired by the Mexican Revolution. One of his famous murals depicts the Holy Trinity as a worker, a soldier, and a peasant. Later he turned his focus to the dehumanizing effect of large cities on the people who live there. When he wasn't painting vast murals, Orozco was drawing political cartoons.\n\nRivera, the third of these Mexican Social Realists, los tres grandes, remains the most famous through sheer force of personality. His storytelling, his love affairs, his radicalism, and his love-hate relationship with the land of his birth informed his life and his paintings. He incorporated Mexican folklore and cultural icons into his murals in an effort to educate working people in their own history.\n\nIn the Chicano neighborhoods of the southwestern United States, political muralism still explodes onto bare walls in the form of graffiti. Edward Seymour's 1949 invention of canned spray paint provided would-be artists with an easy mode of expression, and the graffiti mural took off as an art form in the 1960s and 1970s. It began as outlaw art, which surely would have appealed to an outlaw such as Siqueiros. Despite the new artists' lack of formal training, some members of the outlaw group managed to create something beautiful while making political statements about poverty, injustice, diversity, and racism.\n\nOne extraordinary thing about this kind of public art is that it is truly for everyone. You do not need to enter the halls of a museum to see it; it resides on the walls of your local bodega or school or health clinic; you bounce your ball off of it in the basketball or handball court; you cover it over with posters for your favorite band or flyers about your lost pet.\n\nCertainly, many of the graffiti artists were reviled as nuisances, and their art was erased. For some, however, graffiti would prove a launching point into the world of fine art. Today, modern murals in Austin, San Antonio, Los Angeles, and Tucson, among others, attest to the power of the Mexican tradition of the muralist as purveyor of political thought.\n52. The author's claim that Siqueiros might approve of Chicano graffiti is supported by:",

            "the description of Siqueiros as an army captain",

        "Solution": "52. The correct answer is $\\mathrm{D}$. This evaluation question requires you to assess evidence. Ideally, a writer does not include a statement without adequate support. Here, the statement is that Siqueiros might approve of Chicano graffiti. If you scan to find the exact reference in paragraph 5, you see that the author states, \"It began as outlaw art, which surely would have appealed to an outlaw such as Siqueiros.\" That is a clear giveaway that choice $\\mathrm{D}$ is the best response; Chicano art was outlaw art, and Siqueiros was considered by many to be an outlaw, or gangster.",

        "Solution": "53. The correct answer is $\\mathrm{A}$. This application question calls for making generalizations about a topic-in this case, graffiti. To do this correctly, you must put together the author's statements about the topic and draw a conclusion from the information you are given. Paragraphs on graffiti appear at the end of the passage. Although the author refers to it as \"outlaw art\" and mentions that some people considered it a nuisance, that is clearly not the author's own impression. Phrases such as \"managed to create something beautiful while making political statements about poverty, injustice, diversity, and racism\" and \"public art ... that . . is truly for everyone\" put a positive spin on the topic. The author does not believe that graffiti is a \"pale imitation\" (choice B); instead, she indicates that the graffiti artists are following in the muralists' tradition. Choice $\\mathrm{D}$ appears as a description of Rivera's work and is not relevant to this discussion of graffiti. That makes choice A the most logical answer. Answers and Explanations",
