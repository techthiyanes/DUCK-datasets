Questions 5-8 are based on the following passage.

Passage I

Approximately $0.04 \%$ of Caucasians are born with cystic fibrosis. This disease is one of the most common recessive genetic diseases and is often fatal. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of abnormally thick mucus throughout the body and the loss of excess amounts of salt via sweat. The thick mucus builds up and causes major problems in the lungs, which often become infected, and can cause digestive abnormalities such as malnutrition and blockages through the intestinal tract. The severity of the disease is variable, and many other potential complications can arise.

The gene involved in cystic fibrosis is a mutated allele of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). At least 900 known mutations of this gene can lead to cystic fibrosis. The normal CFTR gene produces the CFTR protein that is a transmembrane chloride channel in cells of the lungs, digestive tract, skin, and reproductive tract. One mutation termed delta F508 has a single amino acid change in the protein that marks it for destruction before it ever reaches the membrane to complete its function. Without the proper CFTR in the membrane of cells, the chloride and sodium ion balance is altered such that not enough water leaves the cells to produce mucus of the proper consistency. The thick mucus that results accumulates and causes multiple problems, including the trapping of bacteria that can cause infections. Although there is no cure for cystic fibrosis, better management strategies have increased the life span of people with this genetic disease. 5. Many potential treatments are being evaluated for cystic fibrosis. Of the items listed, which would appear to have the BEST chance of preventing the symptoms of the disease in an affected person?
A. the use of a drug that increases the production of CFTR
B. the use of a drug that prevents CFTR from being degraded when it reaches the lysosomes
C. the use of a drug that increases nutrient absorption in the small intestine
D. the use of a drug that activates a chloride cell channel other than CFTR

6. The CFTR protein is 1480 amino acids in length. How many codons must have been present in the mRNA used to make the protein?
A. 493
B. 1480
C. 1481
D. 4440

7. If two parents do not have cystic fibrosis but are carriers for the disease, what are their odds of having a child with cystic fibrosis?
A. $0 \%$
B. $25 \%$
C. $50 \%$
D. $75 \%$

8. Pancreatic insufficiency occurs in some cystic fibrosis patients. This means that there is a lack of digestive enzymes being secreted from the pancreas to the small intestine.

A. proteins
B. carbohydrates
C. sugar
D. fats

Questions 9-12 are based on the following passage.

Passage II

Within the cells of the body, mitochondria are present in variable numbers. Some cell types have a few of these organelles, and other cell types have hundreds of mitochondria. An interesting feature of mitochondria that distinguishes them from other organelles is that they have their own DNA, termed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The mtDNA is completely distinct from the nuclear chromosomes and is presumed to have evolved separately from the nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is circular and consists of 37 genes coding for proteins, transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Each mitochondrion has about five copies of the mtDNA. All of the mitochondria within the SECTION 1:

Biological and

Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems MCAT

Practice Test 3 body's cells are descendants of the mitochondria present in an egg cell before it was fertilized. Because all mitochondria are derived from those present in an egg cell, they contain the mtDNA from the mother. Sperm contribute no mitochondria or mtDNA to the egg cell during fertilization. This mode of inheritance is often called maternal inheritance.

Although mtDNA composes a small portion of the cell's total DNA, it is subject to mutation, and several diseases are known to be caused by mutations to mtDNA. One of those diseases is Leber's optic atrophy, which causes deterioration of the optic nerve and a progressive loss of central vision. Most people with this condition have inherited both normal mtDNA and mtDNA that carries the mutation. When mutated mitochondria outnumber normal mitochondria, symptoms of the disease occur.

9. The number of mitochondria in a particular cell type probably relates to:

A. the size of the cell and the amount of space available

B. the number of proteins the cell needs to produce

C. the amount of materials in the cell that need to be degraded and removed

10. Men with mtDNA mutations that cause a disease:

A. will pass them on only to their sons

B. will pass them on only to their daughters

C. will pass them on to both sons and daughters about $50 \%$ of the time

D. will never pass them on to their children

11. Endosymbiotic theory explains why mitochondria have their own DNA. This theory essentially states that at one point, free-living prokaryotic cells were engulfed by another cell, eventually becoming mitochondria. The BEST support for this theory is that:

A. Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles.

B. Mitochondrial DNA resembles that of prokaryotic DNA.

C. Mitochondria have more than one copy of their DNA.

B. translation

C. crossing over and recombination

D. spontaneous mutation Questions 13-16 are based on the following passage.

Passage III

Nitric oxide (NO) is a remarkable gas that acts as a signaling molecule throughout the body. It is produced by vascular endothelium, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle cells. Because the half-life of NO is only a few seconds, its effects are short lived, but it is nevertheless essential to many of the body's regulation processes. A few of the known roles of NO include control over blood vessel dilation and pressure, involvement in inflammation, neurotransmission, and the regulation of apoptosis (programmed cell death). It is suspected that NO has many other roles in the body that are yet to be completely understood.

NO is produced in cells when a group of enzymes known as nitric oxide synthases (NOS) convert the amino acid L-arginine to L-citrulline. NO is produced as a by-product of the reaction. The activity of NO is modulated by cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP). When present, cGMP increases the vasodilating abilities of NO. The expression of phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes causes the degradation of cGMP that suppresses the function of NO.

Because NO acts as a smooth muscle vasodilator, a variety of pharmaceuticals that act on NO have been developed. Nitroglycerin, which decreases the amount of oxygen flowing to the myocardium of the heart, is often used to manage the chest pain of angina that is associated with coronary artery disease. Drugs for erectile dysfunction (ED) such as Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra all work by enhancing NO function and increasing vasodilation and blood flow in the penis during sexual stimulation. Even the nutritional supplement industry has tried to manipulate the effects of NO. Bodybuilders and athletes have been using what are termed NO hemodilators, alleging that these supplements increase blood flow to muscles, making them look larger and recover faster after injury.

13. You would expect that drugs such as Viagra work by:
A. inhibiting PDE enzyme activity
B. decreasing cGMP activity
C. decreasing NOS activity
D. acting as an antagonist to L-arginine

A. The products would have to contain NO to have any of the alleged effects in the body.

B. Because the half-life of NO is so brief, the product most likely contains L-arginine, which can be converted to L-citrulline and NO in the cells.

C. The products would most likely contain the PDE enzyme.

D. The products would contain L-citrulline and NO.

16. One of the contraindications for men taking ED drugs is that they should not be combined with nitroglycerin. What might be an immediate problem observed with men taking nitroglycerin and ED drugs?

A. Both drugs cause vasodilation by increasing NO levels. This could cause blood pressure to drop to dangerous levels.

Passage IV

The origin of eukaryotic organelles has been subject to speculation for many years. In particular, chloroplasts and mitochondria have some unusual features unlike the other organelles of the cell, which suggests they have had a unique history. The evidence collected as a result of the development of molecular research techniques provides an explanation for the origin of these organelles.

The theory of endosymbiosis is used to explain the presence of organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts in modern-day eukaryotic cells. The theory suggests that small prokaryotic cells were at one time engulfed by larger prokaryotic cells. Once inside the larger cells, a symbiotic relationship developed. In the case of mitochondria, it has been speculated that the larger cell was likely anaerobic and ingested a smaller aerobic cell. Once inside, the aerobic cell was able to perform aerobic respiration to produce additional adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the host cell. To explain the evolution of chloroplasts, it has been suggested that cyanobacteria with the ability to photosynthesize were engulfed by a larger anaerobic prokaryotic cell. Support for this theory exists in the fact that both mitochondria and chloroplasts have double membranes, have their own genetic material that is different from typical eukaryotic chromosomal DNA, and have their own ribosomes.

25. According to the endosymbiotic theory presented in this passage, the original anaerobic cell that engulfed the smaller cell was likely performing this process to produce ATP prior to entering a symbiotic relationship.

A. the lysosomes
B. the smooth endoplasmic reticulum
C. the Golgi apparatus
D. the rough endoplasmic reticulum 28. Which of the following would lend additional evidence to the endosymbiotic theory?
A. discovering a difference in the size of the subunits of the ribosomes inside the mitochondria and chloroplasts as compared to the rest of the cell
B. finding that the inner membrane of the mitochondria and chloroplasts resembled that of modern bacteria
C. finding plasmid DNA in the mitochondria and chloroplasts
D. all of the above

Questions 29-32 are based on the following passage.

\section{Passage $\mathrm{V}$}

In the early 1900s, it was noticed that cellular materials that passed from the tumors of chickens with cancer to chickens without cancer would eventually cause cancer to develop in the recipient chickens. In this case it appeared that the cancer was somehow "contagious," and it was suspected that viruses were somehow involved in this infectious type of cancer. Later, it was determined that certain viruses have the ability to genetically transform normal cells to a cancerous state by inserting into the chromosomes of their host cells. The virus that caused cancer was named the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) after its founder. The RSV has only four genes. The gag gene codes for the capsid of the virus, the env gene codes for the envelope of the virus, the pol gene codes for reverse transcriptase, and the $s r c$ gene encodes for a tyrosine kinase.

Within normal cells, there are proto-oncogenes, which are involved in cell division and development. Because most cells are not reproducing all the time, protooncogenes tend to be expressed at low levels or not at all. If viral genetic material inserts into a proto-oncogene, it will be converted to an active oncogene, which stimulates excessive cell division, eventually leading to tumor development. Viruses with this ability are termed oncogenic viruses. Some viruses activate an oncogene by inserting their genetic material into a cellular proto-oncogene, whereas some oncogenic viruses actually carry oncogenes into their hosts. Whether the virus inserts into a cellular proto-oncogene or carries an oncogene into the cell, the end result is increased cell proliferation and changes in the cell, which can include lack of contact inhibition and immortality.

29. Oncogenic viruses are known to become latent as they enter into the host cell's chromosomes. Many oncogenic viruses are retroviruses. In order for a retrovirus to insert into the host cell's chromosomes, it must FIRST:
A. convert its RNA to DNA
B. translate its RNA
C. initiate transcription
D. recombine with the host cell's chromosomes

D. pol only

31. It is known that some viruses carry activated oncogenes into their hosts. What is the BEST explanation for how a virus could acquire an oncogene?
A. The virus spontaneously mutates.
B. The virus acquires the oncogene via conjugation with another virus.
C. The virus is transformed by DNA from another source.
D. The virus acquired the oncogene from a previous host.

32. Once an oncogene is activated and a cell becomes cancerous, which of the following would be MOST likely to halt the excessive cell division associated with cancer?
A. microtubule and mitotic disruption in dividing cells
B. disruption of protein synthesis
C. introduction of additional growth factors to the cell
D. disruption of aerobic cellular respiration

Questions 33-36 are based on the following passage.

Passage VI

Evolutionary theory predicts that given selective pressures, populations will evolve in certain ways. Antibiotic resistance that develops in bacteria is an excellent example of evolutionary selection in action. Spontaneous mutations in bacteria will happen in nature. Due to random chance, some of these mutations provide bacteria the ability to survive in the presence of antibiotics that would normally kill them. These mutations can provide advantages to the bacteria such as the ability to degrade the antibiotics with enzymes, the ability to pump the antibiotic out of the cell, the ability to prevent the antibiotic from entering the cell, and the ability to change target molecules in the cell so that the antibiotic is unable to affect its target. Additionally, most antibiotic-resistance genes can easily be passed from a resistant bacterium to a nonresistant bacterium via the process of conjugation. Transduction by viruses can also carry resistance genes from one bacterium to another. It becomes very easy for an entire bacterial population to become resistant to an antibiotic in a very short period.

Antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern because as bacteria develop resistance to certain antibiotics, those antibiotics are no longer capable of eliminating infections caused by resistant bacteria. Further, some bacteria are able to acquire mutations that provide them with resistance to multiple antibiotics. One such example is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This type of bacteria can be carried asymptomatically by some people and passed to others where it will cause an infection. One of the most common places for MRSA to be spread is through hospitals. The problem with MRSA is that its multiple resistance leaves it susceptible to very few antibiotics. In fact, strains of MRSA are known to show resistance to nearly every antibiotic available.

33. Why would repeated use of antibiotics select for resistant strains of bacteria?
A. The antibiotics would force the bacteria to mutate at a greater rate.
B. The antibiotics would kill the susceptible bacteria, leaving only the resistant ones to multiply.
C. The antibiotics would directly increase the rate of binary fission in resistant organisms.
D. All of the above would be logical reasons that the repeated use of antibiotics selects for resistant bacteria.

34. Conjugation is one method bacteria use to pass their resistance genes to other bacteria. During conjugation, the genes transferred are typically located on:
A. the bacterial chromosome
B. the ribosome
C. the mRNA
D. a plasmid

35. A variety of biotechnology techniques have been developed that allow for manipulated gene transfer. Often, antibiotic-resistance genes are purposefully transferred along with the gene of interest. Why would this be important?
A. to make sure that the transformed cells can survive in the presence of antibiotics
B. to be able to use antibiotics as a marker to select between transformed and nontransformed cells
C. the antibiotic-resistance genes happen to be near the gene of interest being transferred
D. to prevent infection of the transformed cells

36. When humans take antibiotics to treat infections, we rely on the fact that the antibiotics target the bacterial cells while leaving our own cells unharmed. What cell structure in bacteria is structurally different from eukaryotic cells and could potentially be a target of an antibiotic?
A. the cell membrane
B. the DNA nucleotides

Questions 41-44 are based on the following passage.

Passage VII

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare condition characterized by destruction of the insulating myelin sheath on neurons located in the peripheral nervous system. Many people who develop GBS usually have it happen within days or weeks following recovery from a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, but the reason GBS develops is uncertain. Others develop GBS following routine surgeries or vaccinations. GBS has been seen in people of all ages, and it affects men and women equally. The symptoms of GBS typically begin as tingling or weakness in the feet that can lead to paralysis that often ascends through the body. Most of the time, GBS is acute and lasts for a relatively brief period until remyelination of the peripheral nerves can occur. However, for some people, relapses are common and the condition can be chronic. Rarely, GBS can cause permanent paralysis and respiratory failure.

During GBS, the immune system produces antibodies to the surface antigens of peripheral myelin. These antibodies facilitate the destruction of the myelin, which leads to the neurological symptoms. Although GBS does not have a treatment, procedures such as plasmapheresis, also known as plasma exchange, can be used to alleviate the symptoms of GBS. During plasmapheresis, the blood is removed from the body and separated into cells and plasma. The plasma is discarded so that only the blood cells are returned to the body in donated or synthetic plasma. Another treatment option is the intravenous delivery of immunoglobulin. The antibodies present in the immunoglobulin may block the antibodies produced to the surface antigens of peripheral myelin. Typically, the symptoms of GBS subside within months of their onset when treatments such as plasmapheresis or immunoglobulin are used.

41. GBS affects the myelin of the peripheral nervous system. Which neurons in the body should NOT be affected by GBS?
A. those in the arms and legs
B. those in the abdominal cavity
C. those that innervate the heart
D. those in the spinal cord

42. GBS can eventually lead to muscle paralysis due to demyelination of peripheral nerves. The BEST explanation for this would be that:
A. The peripheral nerves can no longer conduct action potentials due to a lack of myelin.
B. The muscle cells no longer respond to acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.
C. The sodium-potassium pumps in the neurons are not functioning properly.
D. The brain is failing to send the appropriate signals to the peripheral nerves.

43. Based on the information provided in the passage, GBS could BEST be described as:
A. a dominant genetic disorder
B. a sex-linked genetic disorder
C. an autoimmune disorder
D. an infectious disease

44. Plasmapheresis seems to help many patients with GBS. The MOST reasonable explanation for why plasmapheresis would alleviate the symptoms of GBS would be that:
A. Replacing the plasma would decrease the number of lymphocytes attacking myelin of the peripheral nerves.
B. There would be less of an attack on peripheral myelin when the antibodies against myelin are removed with the plasma.
C. Replacing the plasma makes the immune system more capable of fighting the infections that are characteristic of GBS.
D. Replacing the plasma would remove any toxins responsible for the symptoms.

Questions 49-52 are based on the following passage.

\section{Passage VIII}

The thyroid gland is best known for its role in the regulation of metabolism via triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is secreted by the pituitary gland in response to declining levels ofT3 and T4. TSH activates the thyroid gland to release T3 and T4, which are stored as thyroglobulin (bound to protein). T3 is about five times more physiologically potent than T4. Thyroglobulin is enzymatically converted to T3, T4, and globulin, and T3 and T4 are released. T4 is converted in the liver to T3 and reverse T3 (RT3). About $80 \%$ of T3 comes from T4 conversion and the other $20 \%$ comes directly from the thyroid gland. Reverse T3 blocks the action of T3 and T4 by occupying T3 and T4 cell receptor sites. A symptom of a thyroid hormone abnormality is the swelling of the thyroid that is referred to as a goiter, which can necessitate a portion or even all of the thyroid gland being surgically removed. After the surgery, synthetic hormones are given in an attempt to regulate the metabolism. Because the thyroid also deals with calcium homeostasis, complete removal of the thyroid can cause calcium levels to become extremely low.

The following data was collected from blood drawn to complete a thyroid panel on a patient suffering from a goiter:

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline & Patient Values & Expected Normal Values \\
\hline Triiodothyronine (T3) & $6.5 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ & $2.3-4.2 \mathrm{pg} / \mathrm{mL}$ \\
Thyroxine (T4) & $14.2 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ & $4.5-12 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ \\
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) & $0.10 \mu \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{mL}$ & $0.35-2.5 \mu \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{L}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

49. Which conclusion is BEST supported by the data?
A. This individual has hypothyroidism, which is caused by low levels of TSH.
B. This individual has hypothyroidism, which is caused by abnormally low levels of thyroglobulin.
C. This individual has hyperthyroidism, which is due to decreased levels of T3.
D. This individual has hyperthyroidism, which is caused by elevated levels of $\mathrm{T} 3$.

50. After complete thyroid removal (which includes removal of the parathyroids), a patient's blood calcium becomes very low. Which of the following responses could potentially help increase calcium levels?

SECTION 1:

Biological and

Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems The process of induced erythrocythemia, or blood doping, has become common among certain circles of athletes such as cyclists. The purpose of blood doping is to provide an endurance advantage to the athlete. There are several ways to induce erythrocythemia, including the injection of synthetic oxygen carriers, blood transfusions, and the injection of hormones.

Synthetic oxygen carriers are modified proteins that have a relatively high affinity for oxygen. These can provide short-term increases in the oxygen-carrying ability of blood, but they are quickly degraded. Blood transfusions can be used right before an athletic event. The transfused erythrocytes can be homologous in nature, meaning that they are harvested from a donor's blood, or they can be autologous, meaning they are removed from the athlete 5 to 10 weeks before the event and stored. The cells are then reinfused right before an athletic event. Another approach to blood doping involves injections of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). The EPO used for this purpose is a recombinant molecule. It is available by prescription for certain medical conditions, but it has been widely abused by some athletes.

Testing for blood doping is not always conclusive. For autologous or homologous transfusions, the only indicator of doping is an elevated hematocrit or hemoglobin count, which is not conclusive evidence of doping. If EPO is being used, it can be detected in the urine but only for short periods. Further, the recombinant version of EPO is hard to distinguish from the natural version, and certain other proteins present in the urine may resemble EPO.

53. What sort of benefit would blood doping provide an athlete?

A. It would increase the number of white blood cells, making the athlete less likely to develop infections.

B. It would increase the clotting ability of the athlete's blood, making the athlete less likely to lose large volumes of blood in the event of an injury.

C. It would increase the number of red blood cells that can provide more oxygen to produce more adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during aerobic cellular respiration.

D. It would decrease the viscosity of the blood, making it easier for the heart to pump.

54. Some athletes prefer the use of autologous transfusions as compared to homologous transfusions. What would be a potential benefit of an autologous transfusion?

A. It would provide more erythrocytes, since some of the ones from a homologous transfusion will die while the blood is in storage waiting to be infused.

B. It would require longer-term advantages in athletic performance as compared to a homologous transfusion.

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.

\section{Passage I}

In October 2012, Felix Baumgartner attempted a world-record sky-diving jump from just over 128,000 ft (39,014 m) above the Earth's surface. He was fitted with a customized, pressurized spacesuit that brought his total weight to $260 \mathrm{lbs}$ ( $1156 \mathrm{~N}$ ). The spacesuit was designed to collect and transmit important monitoring, communications, and tracking information throughout the jump. Baumgartner then ascended to the jumping altitude housed within a pressurized capsule of weight 2900 lbs ( $12900 \mathrm{~N})$ attached to a $30 \times 10^{6}$ cubic feet $\left(8.5 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~L}\right)$ helium-filled weather balloon. The weather balloon with the attached capsule ascended at a rate of $1000 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{min}(5.1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})$, reaching the jumping altitude in approximately two hours.

Once the capsule reached the jumping altitude, the door to the capsule was opened and Baumgartner stepped out and fell forward, beginning his free-fall descent. He continued falling until he reached a maximum speed of $834 \mathrm{mph}(373 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})$, which exceeded the speed of sound. This speed was Baumgartner's terminal velocity-the velocity attained in which he was no longer being accelerated downward due to gravity. Once he reached this speed, Baumgartner deployed his parachute and glided safely to Earth's surface.

Besides being able to exist as a diatomic liquid, bromine can frequently be found in salts and is useful in preparing organic molecules with a range of functions. Some of these uses include pesticides, water purification, prescription drugs, photochemicals, and flame retardants. In some sodas, one can find brominated vegetable oil added as an emulsifying agent. In addition to its strong odor, bromine is a dark, brown-orange liquid at room temperature. Bromine has two stable isotopes, Br-79 and Br-81, and a relative atomic abundance, which causes the atomic mass of bromine to be 79.904. Bromine-80 is one of the many unstable isotopes of bromine. It readily undergoes beta decay to form $\mathrm{Kr}-80$. Bromine can also undergo other modes of decay to form $\mathrm{Kr}-80$. When analyzing organic compounds that have bromine in them, the mass spectrometric analysis of the compound frequently shows a peak of equal intensity at $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{z}=79$ and $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{z}=81$, or $\mathrm{M}^{+}$and $\mathrm{M}^{+2}$ peaks of equal height as well.

\section{Passage III}

Electromagnetic radiation is often described in physics textbooks as a transverse wave that travels in a vacuum at a speed of $c=3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Formed by coupled oscillating electric and magnetic fields, electromagnetic radiation comprises all of the types of waves represented within the electromagnetic spectrum, varying in frequency, $f$, SECTION 2:

Practice Test 3 and wavelength, $\lambda$, according to the equation, $c=f \lambda$. In addition to its wavelike properties, electromagnetic radiation behaves as waves do. However, classic experiments in quantum physics have also discovered that light behaves as a particle. The particle of light, known as a photon, has energy $E=h f$ where $h$ is Planck's constant $\left(h=6.63 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~J} \cdot \mathrm{s}\right.$ ) and $f$ is frequency. This apparent contradiction is accepted as the "wave-particle duality of light." Two classical experiments that substantiated the "wave-particle duality of light" were Fraunhofer single-slit diffraction and the Compton scattering (see figure).

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_cc4dbbdf5b0a8f473618g-24.jpg?height=561&width=1219&top_left_y=771&top_left_x=564)

In Fraunhofer single-slit diffraction, monochromatic light is incident parallel to a diffraction grating with a single slit of width $d$. The light rays will bend around the opening of the slit and project onto a flat screen located a distance, $L$, from the diffraction grating as a pattern of bright and dark fringes. The pattern of dark fringes (minima) are described by $d \sin \theta=m \lambda, m=1,2,3, \ldots$ as the integer value of the particular fringe.

In Compton scattering, a photon of initial energy $E_{\mathrm{ph}}$ and wavelength $\lambda_{i}$ is incident upon an electron of mass $m_{e}$, initially at rest. Upon collision, the photon is deflected with a scattered energy $E_{\mathrm{ph}}^{\prime}$ at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the incident axis as well as an increased wavelength, $\lambda_{f}$, given by $\lambda_{f}=\lambda_{i}+\left(\frac{h}{m_{e} c}\right)(1-\cos \theta)$ where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $m_{e}$ is the rest mass of the electron $\left(9.1 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg}\right)$. The Compton-scattered electron scatters with an energy $E_{\mathrm{el}}$ at an angle $\varphi$.

16. According to the nature and description of the two experiments in the passage, you can conclude that:

A. Single-slit diffraction supports the wave nature of light, whereas Compton scattering supports the particle nature of light.

B. Single-slit diffraction supports the particle nature of light, whereas Compton scattering supports the wave nature of light.

C. Both single-slit diffraction and Compton scattering support the wave nature of light.

D. Both single-slit diffraction and Compton scattering support the particle nature of light. 17. If the electromagnetic radiation in the single-slit diffraction experiment were to behave as a particle, the interference pattern would probably look like which of the following?

A.

A schematic of the rubber band slingshot is shown in the following illustration:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_cc4dbbdf5b0a8f473618g-26.jpg?height=447&width=1219&top_left_y=763&top_left_x=564)

Before the slingshot was constructed, a series of measurements were performed on the rubber band to determine the stretching distance, $x_{\mathrm{el}}$, as a function of an elastic force, $F_{\mathrm{el}}$, applied to the rubber band. The data is shown here:

\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
\hline $\boldsymbol{F}_{\mathbf{e l}}(\mathbf{N})$ & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
$\boldsymbol{x}_{\mathbf{e l}}(\mathbf{c m})$ & 14 & 21 & 26 & 30 \\

The students used the data to theoretically determine the landing distance of a marble. To compare the effectiveness of their theoretical calculations, the students then launched a marble by stretching the rubber band slingshot to four different values of $x_{\mathrm{el}}$, and recorded the corresponding landing distances, $\Delta x$. The data is shown in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\hline Stretch Distance, $\boldsymbol{x}_{\text {el }}$ & $2.00 \mathrm{~cm}$ & $4.00 \mathrm{~cm}$ & $6.00 \mathrm{~cm}$ & $8.00 \mathrm{~cm}$ \\
Predicted Value, $\boldsymbol{\Delta} \boldsymbol{x}_{\mathbf{p r}}$ & $3.94 \mathrm{~m}$ & $5.63 \mathrm{~m}$ & $7.18 \mathrm{~m}$ & $8.45 \mathrm{~m}$ \\
Observed Value, $\boldsymbol{\Delta} \boldsymbol{x}_{\mathbf{o b}}$ & $2.64 \mathrm{~m}$ & $4.55 \mathrm{~m}$ & $6.01 \mathrm{~m}$ & $8.04 \mathrm{~m}$ \\

Questions 28-32 are based on the following passage.

Passage $\mathrm{V}$

A standard imaging procedure in the investigation and evaluation of patients with cardiovascular disease is nuclear stress testing. Nuclear stress testing is often used to determine the extent of coronary artery blockage and assess the damage of heart muscle that arises as a result of a heart attack. In a typical nuclear stress test, the patient first walks on a treadmill to elevate the heart rate. Several minutes into the exercising period, a radiotracer, or a drug tagged with a radioactive element known to target the heart, is injected into the patient's vein and allowed to circulate. As the radiotracer circulates through the blood flow within the heart, the radioactive element decays, emitting gamma radiation that is collected by a gamma ray detector. If a part of the heart's muscle is damaged and not receiving blood flow, the amount of gamma rays detected from this area is less than normal regions of heart muscle. The collected gamma rays are used to produce images of the functional capacity of the heart, allowing the physician to identify any regions of the heart that are functioning below normal capacity.

A common radioactive element used in this testing procedure is thallium-201 (Tl-201). With a half-life of 73 hours, $\mathrm{Tl}-201$ decays to mercury-201 (Hg-201) by electron capture according to:

$$
{ }_{81}^{201} \mathrm{Tl}+{ }_{-1}^{0} e \rightarrow{ }_{80}^{201} \mathrm{Hg}+{ }_{0}^{0} v
$$

The radioactive emissions from $\mathrm{Tl}-201$ are primarily $\mathrm{x}$-rays in the energy range 69 to $83 \mathrm{keV}$, with gamma rays of energy $135 \mathrm{keV}$ and $167 \mathrm{keV}$ emitted less frequently.

A. $A$ is constant; $N$ increases; $Z$ increases

C. $A$ increases; $N$ increases; $Z$ is constant
D. $A$ increases; $N$ is constant; $Z$ is constant 29.

A. $0.074 \AA$
B. $0.183 \AA$
C. $0.259 \AA$

\section{Passage VI}

Fritz Haber (1868-1934) was a German chemist who designed a method for making ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen. This was to Germany's advantage during World War I. The Haber process is an industrial method for making ammonia, $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. This process takes $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gases and combines them at high temperatures $\left(425^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and high pressures (200 $\mathrm{atm}$ ) to force the triple-bonded nitrogen gas to react according to the reversible reaction:

$$

Passage IX

Human tooth enamel is composed of the mineral hydroxyapatite, which has the formula $\mathrm{Ca}_{5}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{3} \mathrm{OH}$. It is insoluble in water, but due to its basicity, it is soluble in acid solution.

Plaque forms on teeth due to a combination of carbohydrates and proteins, called mucin, which produces a film that builds up if not removed by thorough cleaning of the teeth and gums. Plaque traps food particles, which can be fermented by bacteria and produce lactic acid. Saliva does contain buffering agents that can neutralize acid SECTION 2:

Practice Test 3 in the mouth, but saliva cannot penetrate solid plaque. Lactic acid levels can drop to as low as pH $4.5$ inside the plaque. As the plaque becomes more acidic, hydroxyapatite is converted to calcium hydrogen phosphate, which dissolves in water. The equation is as follows:

$$
\mathrm{Ca}_{5}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{3} \mathrm{OH}(s)+4 \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}(a q) \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{CaHPO}_{4}(a q)+2 \mathrm{Ca}^{+2}(a q)+5 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

When the hydroxyapatite reacts, cavities can form. The addition of fluoride to municipal water supplies and to toothpaste has lowered the incidence of cavities in children in the United States. Many children also have fluoride treatments as part of their routine dental care.

Fluoride has the ability to replace the hydroxide ion in hydroxyapatite, forming a compound called fluoroapatite. Fluoroapatite not only has a smaller $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ value than hydroxyapatite, it is less basic as well. Thus it is far less soluble in acid solution. The reaction of fluoride with hydroxyapatite is as follows:

$$
\mathrm{Ca}_{5}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{3} \mathrm{OH}(s)+\mathrm{F}^{-}(a q) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ca}_{5}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{3} \mathrm{~F}(s)+\mathrm{OH}^{-}(a q)
$$

The $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ of hydroxyapatite is $7 \times 10^{-37}$. The $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ of fluoroapatite is $1 \times 10^{-60}$.

53. The dissolution of hydroxyapatite in water is BEST represented by:
A. $\mathrm{Ca}_{5}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{3} \mathrm{OH}(s) \rightleftharpoons 5 \mathrm{Ca}(a q)+3 \mathrm{PO}_{4}(a q)+\mathrm{OH}(a q)$
B. $\mathrm{Ca}_{5}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{3} \mathrm{OH}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ca}_{5}(a q)+\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{3}(a q)+\mathrm{OH}(a q)$
C. $\mathrm{Ca}_{5}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{3} \mathrm{OH}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ca}_{5}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{3}^{+1}(a q)+\mathrm{OH}^{-}(a q)$
D. $\mathrm{Ca}_{5}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{3} \mathrm{OH}(s) \rightleftharpoons 5 \mathrm{Ca}^{+2}(a q)+3 \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-3}(a q)+\mathrm{OH}^{-}(a q)$

\section{Passage I}

Researchers studying signal detection have documented various magnitude differences necessary to detect the presence of stimuli (absolute threshold) and to detect changes in the perceptual experience of the stimuli (just noticeable difference). These differences are dependent on the type of sensory experience being measured and can be characterized by proportional differences in magnitude rather than absolute amounts.

A recent study examined the just noticeable difference necessary to perceive tempo changes. In this experiment, signal detection methods were used to examine the amount of change necessary to detect a difference between an initial/target tempo and a comparison stimulus. Two test conditions were evaluated. The initial/target tempo MCAT

Practice Test 3 speed was either slow (43 beats per minute [bpm]) or fast (75 bpm). Comparison tempos were presented that were either sped up or slowed down relative to the initial/ target tempo. Participants were asked to identify whether the comparison tempos were the same tempo or a different tempo from the initial/target tempo. The accompanying graph depicts the tempo changes necessary for detection for both the slow and fast initial/target tempos.

of Behavior Jean Piaget, a prominent figure in developmental psychology, believed that the development of all cognitive abilities occurred during the first two years of life. Piaget devised various procedures for examining development in young children. These activities focused on how children (and people) think and how they interact with the world around them. Piaget asserted that biological changes interacted with childhood experiences, resulting in unique developmental stages characterized by schemas, or mental structures. The following table lists the four stages of development identified by Piaget and their function.

SECTION 3:

Psychological,

Foundations of Behavior The study of emotional experience is often characterized by the attempt to answer the question, "Which comes first, the experience or the label?" Some researchers suggest that the physiological arousal occurs, then the individual contextualizes the experience based on his or her environment, resulting in emotion such as "fear" or "happiness." Other researchers suggest that humans can subconsciously identify the difference in arousal caused by various emotional states or that the arousal and classification occur in parallel.

Recent research has examined the relationship between culture and emotion. One such study examined the differences between how American and Japanese participants contextualize emotion. The researchers examined athletes' use of emotionrelated words in interviews. Compared to American athletes, Japanese athletes were found to be more likely to identify emotions with others than with themselves. Based on these findings, the researchers conducted a second experiment in which they asked Japanese and American participants to describe typical emotions experienced by Olympic medalists. The researchers counted the number of emotion-related words and assigned them to either self-focused or self+other-focused groups for comparison.

The results of the second study are shown in the following graph.

Which statement BEST describes how the Schachter-Singer theory of emotion could be used to interpret the results of this study?

A. The experiences triggered physiological arousal, which caused specific emotions. Because the physiological arousal conditions were similar, the responses between the cultural groups were similar as well.

B. The experiences triggered autonomic arousal, which the participants then appraised. Each group interpreted their emotional experiences based on cultural differences as a result of the appraisal process.

C. The experiences activated the thalamus, which simultaneously created both physiological arousal and the emotion. Any differences observed were due to different types of arousal in participants from different cultures.

D. Experiences between cultures occur in different ways and use different brain regions. The observed cultural differences represent different theories of emotion.

Foundations of Behavior In a famous series of experiments, the social psychologist Stanley Milgram captured important observations about human compliance. Participants in the experiments were told to play the role of "teachers" and ask "learners" to answer questions. They were not told that the learners were actually actors. Every time a learner gave an incorrect answer, a confederate posing as an authority figure instructed the teacher to administer an electric shock to the learner. The learner would then pretend to suffer pain, even though the "shock" delivered via a realistic-looking apparatus was actually harmless. If a learner continued to provide incorrect answers, the authority figure told the teacher to increase the intensity of the "shock" all the way up to what was said to be a lethal level.

The results from the experiment are depicted in the following graph.

Passage VIII

The psychologist Harry Harlow conducted a series of famous experiments investigating maternal attachment in monkeys, with multiple derivations on his classic study comparing infant attachment to nutrients versus comforting inanimate objects. This research is often referenced to show the development of early attachment and is an example of comparative psychology. The results of Harlow's research present some compelling evidence for the criticality of infant relationships.

The graphs that follow show one of Harlow's later experiments in infant monkey attachment, with hypothetical data representing the behavior captured by Harlow in that study. This data set represents the amount of time (hours per day) that infant monkeys spent with surrogate (artificial) representations of their mothers. The surrogates were either made of wood covered in cloth or made of bare wire. Both the cloth surrogate and the wire surrogate were provided with a rubber nipple that allowed for feeding. Both surrogates were present for all monkeys. The aim of the study was to determine which of the two surrogates the infant monkeys would choose to spend SECTION 3:

Questions 56-59 are based on the following passage.

Passage XI

Greater sleep coherency with fewer awakenings and more consistent sleep is associated with better-quality sleep. However, sleep measurements often require complex electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors that require specific placement and are messy to attach to the head. This makes EEG sleep measurements difficult to perform in a home environment. One distal method to measure sleep coherency is using actigraphy. Lightweight cloth bands (e.g., sweat bands) with sensors in them are placed on the wrists and ankles to measure nighttime movements. More activity can indicate less coherent sleep patterns.

A researcher interested in the effect of noise pollution on those living near the negative amenity of an active airport recruits 100 people to wear actigraphs for one week while they are in bed. The results are shown on the following graph.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_cc4dbbdf5b0a8f473618g-59.jpg?height=616&width=1225&top_left_y=1367&top_left_x=336)

A. Living close to an airport has a significant impact on sleep coherency.
B. There is an inverse correlation between proximity to the airport and sleep quality.
C. Sleep and nighttime activity are not correlated.
D. Living close to an airport is related to increased nighttime movements, which suggest poorer sleep quality.

57. Given your knowledge about neighborhoods near negative amenities, what other conditions might be TRUE?

A. Individuals who work at the airport probably live near the airport and probably have to get up at night to go into work.

B. Individuals who live near noisy environments eventually adapt, so the people in this study who live close to the airport and have high nighttime activity levels must be new to the area.

C. The closer a neighborhood is to negative amenities, the cheaper the home prices and the more likely that the neighborhood qualifies as a lower socioeconomic status (SES).

D. Lower SES individuals tend to make poor housing choices and therefore are more likely to experience disrupted sleep.

58. The next logical step to study this phenomenon would MOST likely be:
A. a laboratory-based study with electroencephalograms (EEGs) in an environ- ment that mimics airport noise
B. comparing intelligence quotient (IQ) ratings for people who live $0.5$ miles, $2.5$ miles, and 5 miles away from the airport
C. asking people how long they have lived in those neighborhoods and why they live near the airport
D. identifying racial or ethnic characteristics of the neighborhood that may account for night movement

59. Which potential consequence is LEAST likely to affect individuals who live near the airport based on current sociological understanding?
A. difficulty with concentration; poorer grades
B. more time off work due to increased colds and flus
C. more time spent at work to avoid noise pollution, resulting in greater productivity
D. more car accidents and increased transportation costs

\section{Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills}

Questions 1-4 are based on the following passage.

Passage I

Recent research indicates that our experience of happiness can be self-regulated, regardless of external circumstances. We can actively choose to be happy. It was previously thought that levels of happiness were genetically determined; people were born with a genetic predisposition to cheerfulness or pessimism. However, studies now suggest that such predispositions, although present, are not fixed. Instead, emotion, and indeed the structure of the brain, can be modified through certain practices.

These findings are indebted to the work of psychologist Gordon Watson, who in 1930 conducted a study entitled "Happiness Among Adult Students of Education." Because happiness was considered a highly desired yet elusive and mysterious emotion, Watson's serious endeavor was startling. By the 1970s, the psychological community was researching happiness on a larger scale. Today, it is estimated that over 2000 researchers in 42 countries are actively involved in happiness research.

In that crowded field, the work of a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Richard Davidson, stands out. Davidson observed patterns of brain activity as they related to a subject's mental and emotional states, using brain science's new technologies, including quantitative electrophysiology, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. He discovered what Western science once believed to be impossible: that the brain is not a static organ-it is able to change and develop over time. This capacity is known as neuroplasticity, and it has had a profound effect on the study of happiness.

Davidson's studies found that the functions of the brain's cerebral cortex are not limited to determining intelligence, interpreting sensory impulses, and controlling motor function as once believed. In fact, this area also determines personality, including emotional predispositions. Levels of activity on the right and left sides of the cerebral cortex relate to feelings of happiness and sadness. Specifically, higher levels of activity at the left frontal area of the cerebral cortex coincide with feelings of happiness, For example, meditation has been shown to generate left-brain activity, and studies show that it produces positive emotions. Davidson studied the link between meditation and happiness through a project involving Tibetan Buddhist monks. His research brings together Eastern and Western traditions, and it links together objective reality with internal states of consciousness once thought to be subjective. The connection is made through observable electrical activity in the central nervous system. When the monks in the study meditated, their brain activity was recorded. Increases in left cerebral cortex activity indicate that the practice of meditation can, over time, change the structure of the brain, increasing the size and activity level of the left cerebral cortex.

Another practice that has been shown to stimulate left cerebral cortex activity and enhance feelings of happiness is the altering of conscious thoughts. More specifically, when a subject repeats positive affirmations_thinking optimistic thoughts-activity in the left cerebral cortex increases. As with the practice of meditation, the repetition of positive affirmations can change the structure of the brain over time, creating feelings of happiness and well-being. These findings show that the mind-body connection cannot be denied.

Questions 5-11 are based on the following passage.

Passage II

In sharp contrast to the modern, confessional poetry of the 20th century, the oeuvre of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow seems quaint and primly Victorian. During his lifetime, however, he was the most celebrated poet in the country. A closer look at the history of American poetry reveals that, despite his eminence, Longfellow wrote in a mold of both form and content that was already being challenged during his lifetime. But why, a century later, do the artistic works of many of his contemporaries continue to be enjoyed and studied while Longfellow languishes in the tomb of cultural artifacts?

One answer lies in the radical shift that began to take place in poetry in the mid19th century. Longfellow's themes and steadfast rhymes (and those of John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and James Russell Lowell) gave way gradually to confessional verse, whose subjects were more personal and rhymes were looser and less conventional. But to understand this shift, one must first understand the nature of Longfellow's work and his standing in the American literary scene of his time.

Longfellow took as his subject his country's historical imagination, writing on an epic scale about Paul Revere, the Indian Hiawatha, and the pilgrim Miles Standish. He bestowed a mythic dimension on these figures, giving American readers iconic images that helped form a collective consciousness in the new country (indeed, Longfellow was a part of the first generation to be born in the United States). But Longfellow's content went beyond nationalistic pride-it was highly accessible and incredibly popular. Its accessibility is explained by his obvious themes that could be easily understood and embraced by the public. Longfellow did not challenge his readers, but appealed to their desire for stories that expounded an optimistic, sentimental, and moralistic worldview. Those themes were explored in rhyme that allowed readers to commit the poems to memory, much like songs. In 1857, The Song of Hiawatha, arguably his bestknown poem, sold 50,000 copies, an astounding number at the time. The next year, The Courtship of Miles Standish sold 25,000 copies in two months and in London sold 10,000 copies in one day. His success allowed him to give up a professorship at Harvard and focus full time on his writing.

Walt Whitman, Longfellow's contemporary, wrote poetry similar to that of Longfellow-romantic and sentimental, with conventional rhyme and meter. But in the 1850s, indeed two years before The Song of Hiawatha, he wrote and published Leaves of Grass; a more radical departure from his previous work could not have been imagined. The 12 unnamed poems comprising Leaves of Grass are written in free verse-that is, without conventional rhyme and meter. Yet, like Longfellow, he was determined to explore the subject of America and his love for his country.

Whitman looked to the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson for inspiration. Emerson wrote "America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography dazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for metres." Indeed, Whitman paraphrased Emerson in his preface SECTION 4:

Critical

Analysis and Reasoning Skills Whitman's groundbreaking free verse changed the trajectory of American poetry. The next generation of poets, including Ezra Pound, Hart Crane, Sherwood Anderson, and William Carlos Williams, celebrated their debt to Whitman. Decades later, the influence of Whitman's work on Allen Ginsberg and Langston Hughes, among many others, continues his legacy.

5. According to the passage, what might be the current reputation of poets such as Whittier and Holmes?

A. They are considered integral writers in the history of American poetry.

B. They are reviled as part of the Victorian Romantic period of American poetry.

C. They are regarded as antiquated due to their conventional form and content.

D. They are viewed as an influence on the Modern movement.

6. The main argument of the passage is that:

A. Whitman's free verse is superior to Longfellow's rhymes.

B. Longfellow's standing as an American poet was diminished by a rejection of quaint subjects and conventional rhyme and meter that came in the wake of poets such as Whitman.

C. Longfellow would be read and studied more today if he had retained his nationalistic subject matter but eschewed the sentimental tone and standard forms of his poems.

D. Ralph Waldo Emerson aided in the transformation of American poetry from Victorian Romanticism to Modernism.

7. Which of the following statements is NOT presented as evidence that Whitman is responsible for the radical shift in American poetry that occurred in the 19th century?

A. He used iconic American figures as his subjects.

B. His poetry was more personal and intimate than that of his predecessors or contemporaries.

C. He wrote about the common man and commonplace events.

D. He began writing in free verse rather than conventional rhymes. 8. What does the author mean by "tomb of cultural artifacts"?
A. a resting place for dead poets
B. a kind of cemetery in which people can pay their respects to writers of the past

D. a group of ideas and works of art from the past that are considered to be dead

9. The author apparently believes that:
A. Poems about iconic American figures can become best-sellers.
B. Whitman's poems are more popular than Longfellow's because people prefer free verse and more personal poetry.
C. Ralph Waldo Emerson could be considered the father of Modern American poetry.
D. Contemporary confessional poetry owes much to the work of Longfellow.

10. One of America's most famous Modern poets, Ezra Pound, said of Walt Whitman, "As for Whitman, I read him (in many parts) with acute pain, but when I write of certain things I find myself using his rhythms." How does this quote affect the author's contention that Pound and his generation of poets celebrated their debt to Whitman?
A. It repudiates it.
B. It endorses it.
C. It denies the contention by showing Pound's distaste for Whitman's work.
D. It calls into question the author's use of the word celebrate.

On what basis might it be said that animals have rights? To partisans on either side of the debate, the question itself seems absurd. Supporters of animal rights would reply that animals, as living creatures, have the same type of rights enjoyed by all living beings. Opponents of the cause would rejoin that rights are the product of rationalism and thus are the sole province of humans.

One interesting moral perspective from which to view the debate comes from the philosophy of utilitarianism. Jeremy Bentham, widely credited as the father of utilitarianism, believed that the rightness or wrongness of actions should be judged by the effect they have on all the beings affected by the action. The entire world comprised a closed system to which the actions of any member of the system either added to the SECTION 4:

Critical

Analysis and Reasoning Skills Bentham himself believed that the good of animals should be taken into consideration in utilitarianism. The issue for him was not whether animals could reason (debatable) or talk (obviously not), but whether they could suffer (absolutely). An animal's capacity for suffering, argued Bentham, implied not necessarily that it should have rights equal to those of man, but that its pain should be given equal consideration when determining exactly what rights it had. It is from this perspective that animal rights can be most justified.

Obviously, it doesn't make sense to say that animals should have the right to free speech or the right to vote, because these are capacities the animal does not and cannot ever possess. But it would be sensible to say that animals have a right to be free from unnecessary pain or suffering. This view of animal rights would preclude many current practices, such as using animals to test new drugs and cosmetics and even perhaps the mass production of animals for food and clothing.

Interestingly, utilitarianism also provides opponents of animal rights with justification for their views. Because utilitarianism is based on calculations of the total good of the system, it is possible to see animal exploitation as adding to, rather than subtracting from, the sum of happiness. For instance, the death of one cow could presumably provide food and clothing for multiple people. This increase of happiness for the many at the expense of the few would satisfy the tenets of utilitarianism. Alternatively, opponents could argue that because utilitarianism operates in a closed system, the negative effect of the death or suffering of one creature can be negated by the birth or pleasure of another creature. Because there are many times more animals that are born and live out their natural lives free from human-inflicted cruelty, the supposed suffering of those animals used for food, clothing, and experimentation is neutralized.

Questions 18-23 are based on the following passage.

Passage IV

In literature, the period typically referred to as the 20th century actually begins in the previous century. To many, Queen Victoria's Jubilee in 1887 effectively marked the end of a literary epoch. The prevailing aesthetic sensibility, art for art's sake, was dying a slow death, as the gulf between artists and writers and the rest of the public widened, resulting in the widespread idea of the artist as one alienated from the rest of society. This viewpoint was spurred on by the bohemian culture movement, which arose in France and quickly spread. At its core, the bohemian movement scoffed at the limits placed on the individual by polite society and sought to isolate the artist from society as one who both rejects and is rejected by society.

Across the English Channel, developments in England further accentuated the separation of the artist from society at large. The Education Act of 1870 made elementary education mandatory, creating a massive class of literate, though still mostly uneducated, consumers. In response to this new market, new forms of entertainment were created, including the cheap and sensational "yellow press," which focused on scandal, crime, and other base aspects of human nature. Furthermore, publishers SECTION 4:

audiences, the degree and the speed at which these audiences became fragmented occurred at an unprecedented rate in the early 20th century.

The emergence and mass production of such so-called popular literature provided more fodder for the artistic elite's war on the crude and unsophisticated philistines in the public square. Perhaps this divide and the artist's growing awareness of difference led to a prevalence of pessimism and stoicism in the literature of the late Victorian period. Hardy, Housman, and Stevenson all expressed at least some form of overweening negativity or passivity in their prose and poetry.

The end of Victoria's reign brought Edward VII to the throne, and Edwardian England seemed to articulate all those qualities the artistic elite had grown weary of. Edward VII has been described as self-indulgent, and his 10 -year regime was a boon to those who had the means to enjoy a life of idle pleasures. Although in the past artists and writers enjoyed the patronage of the royal family and other notables, now they strove to keep their distance from such decadence, perhaps to avoid contaminating their art, perhaps to further their sense of alienation from society.

The Edwardian period lasted a mere decade, with the prevailing cultural mentality changed by the ascendancy of GeorgeV to the throne in 1910 and thoroughly extirpated by England's entry into World War I in 1914. With the advantage of hindsight, the Georgian period seems an especially crucial one, a necessary balancing point between the gilded nature of the Edwardian age and the somewhat artificial staidness of the Victorian period. It was in this brief four-year period that English literature held its breath, and when it exhaled, at the end of the Great War, the old order in Europe was no more.

B. Writers in America continued to embrace French bohemianism.

C. Writers and artists worked to reintegrate themselves into society.

D. The reign of George $V$ came to an end.

Questions 24-30 are based on the following passage.

\section{Passage $\mathrm{V}$}

Engineers and computer scientists are intrigued by the potential power of nanocomputing. Nanocomputers will use atoms and molecules to perform their functions instead of the standard integrated circuits now employed. Theorists believe that the amount of information a nanocomputer could handle is staggering.

A professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has attempted to calculate the computational limits of a computer with a weight of 1 kilogram and a volume of 1 liter. According to the laws of physics, the potential amount of computational power is a function of the available energy. Basically, each atom and subatomic particle in the computer has an amount of energy attached to it. Furthermore, the energy of each particle or atom is increased by the frequency of its movement. Thus the power of a computer that uses nanotechnology is bounded by the energy available from its atoms.

Specifically, the relationship between the energy of an object and its computation potential is a proportionate one. As Einstein has famously calculated, the energy of an object is equal to its mass times the speed of light squared. Thus, a theoretical computer weighing a mere kilogram has a huge amount of potential energy. To find the total computational power, the minimum amount of energy required to perform an operation is divided by the total amount of energy. SECTION 4:

Analysis and Reasoning Skills 
of energy possessed by a 1-kilogram computer by Planck's constant yields a tremendously large number, roughly $5 \times 10^{50}$ operations per second. Using even the most conservative estimates of the computing power of the human brain, such a computer would have the computational power of five trillion trillion human civilizations. The computer would also have a memory capacity, calculated by determining the degrees of freedom allowed by the state of all the particles comprising it, of $10^{31} \mathrm{bits}$.

These numbers are purely theoretical, however. Were the computer to convert all of its mass to energy, it would be the equivalent of a thermonuclear explosion. And it is unreasonable to expect human technology to ever achieve abilities even close to these limits. However, a project at the University of Oklahoma has succeeded in storing 50 bits of data per atom, albeit on only a limited number of atoms. Given that there are $10^{25}$ atoms in 1 kilogram of material, it may be possible to fit up to $10^{27}$ bits of information in the computer. And if scientists are able to exploit the many properties of atoms to store information, including the position, spin, and quantum state of all its particles, it may be possible to exceed even that number.

One interesting consequence of such staggering increases in computing power is that each advance could provide the basis for further evolution. Once technology can achieve, for instance, a level of computation equal to $10^{40}$ operations per second, it can use that massive power to help bring the theoretical limit ever closer.

Questions 31-37 are based on the following passage.

\section{Passage VI}

Language consists of three main parts. The first is simply vocabulary, the lexicon of words available to the speaker to describe particular concepts, actions, and states. The second part is morphology, the set of rules that dictates how words and parts of words may be combined to form other words. The final part of language is syntax, the rules that combine words into phrases and sentences. It is morphology that we shall turn our attention to first.

Morphology has two major subdivisions. They are derivation and inflection. Derivation refers to those rules by which new words may be formed out of preexisting words. Inflection, sometimes referred to as conjugation and declension, states how words are changed to indicate their function within a sentence.

Although common mythology holds that English is one of the most difficult languages to learn, many linguists would beg to differ. In fact, when it comes to inflection, SECTION 4:

Analysis and Reasoning Skills 
the conditional, the subjunctive, the imperative, and others. Languages from outside the Indo-European family tree may be even more complex. The Bantu language of Kivunjo has roughly half a million combinations of prefixes and suffixes for a verb. English, however, has a mere four combinations. A verb such as to walk is limited to the following forms: walk, walks, walked, and walking.

Although there are only four basic verb forms, the English language does have more than 13 possible inflections. It just makes do with these four forms for the various functions. English also differs significantly from many other Indo-European languages in that in English, the stem of the word can be pronounced and is in fact part of the language. In Spanish, the stem of the verb to walk is camin-, but this is not a word in the language. In order to pronounce this word, it must be conjugated and combined with a suffix. English uses the stem form of the verb for four inflections: the present tense (except for the third-person singular), the infinitive, the imperative, and the subjunctive. The verb form ending in $-s$ is used in only one case, the third-person singular.

The two possible verb suffixes, -ing and $-e d$, are put to use in a variety of ways as well. The -ing ending appears in the progressive participle, the present participle, the gerund form, and the verbal adjective form. That leaves the $-e d$ form to handle the remaining inflections, including the past tense, the perfect participle, the passive participle, and some verbal adjectives.

Why are there so many different inflections for verb forms that basically sound the same? Simply put, the meanings implied by the various moods are different, even if the words used are fairly similar. Compare the meaning conveyed by the simple past tense (he walked) to the meaning inherent in the perfect participle (he has walked).

31. The central thesis of the passage is that:
A. English is easier to learn than many other languages.
B. Each language is unique in its major forms.
C. The English language uses a minimum of verb forms in its inflections.
D. The English language is not as rich in meaning as other languages.

32. The passage suggests that the author MOST likely believes that:
A. The English language does not suffer from its lack of inflections.
B. English is the only language in which the verb stem is a word.
C. English is not as hard to learn as many think.
D. At one time the English language had more inflections. 33. Which of the following assertions does the author support with an example?

I. The English language is relatively simple in its inflections.

II. The English language is not as hard to learn as some believe.

III. Inflections in the English language can convey a variety of meanings.
A. I only
B. III only
C. I and III only
D. II and III only

34. The ideas presented in this passage would probably be MOST interesting to:
A. linguists
B. language teachers
C. psychologists
D. translators

35. The passage indicates that a native Spanish speaker may be puzzled by the verb to see in which of the following sentences?
A. I saw the car.
B. They want to see the car.
C. She sees the car.
D. Seeing is believing.

36. According to the passage, which English inflection can be expressed by two different verb suffixes?

I. the present tense

II. the verbal adjective

III. the present participle
A. I only
B. I and II only
C. III only
D. I, II, and III

37. The Russian language is similar to the Spanish language in that the verbs have stem forms that are not words unto themselves. From this fact, a linguist might infer that:
A. Russian verbs have roughly 50 forms.
B. The Russian language may be of the Indo-European family.
C. Russian is harder to learn than Spanish.
D. The Russian language has more inflections than the English language.

Passage VII

The man whom Franklin Delano Roosevelt christened “The Happy Warrior" in a nominating speech would later become a thorn in Roosevelt's side. Some thought the switch in loyalties was sour grapes, but others saw Alfred E. Smith as the epitome of William Wordsworth's "happy warrior" and therefore a man who "makes his moral being his prime care"-one who never made a move without consulting his conscience.

Alfred E. Smith was both a successful politician and an unsuccessful one. A fourterm governor of New York State, he seemed a sure candidate for president, and indeed he ran three times for that position, only to lose each time.

He had several strikes against him. He was the Catholic son of Irish and ItalianGerman immigrants, making him anathema to nativists, the xenophobes who underwent a resurgence in the 1920s. He was from New York City, viewed even in the early twentieth century as disconnected from the national character. He was a progressive, which made conservatives of all stripes nervous. And he favored the repeal of Prohibition, a position that lost him the backing of many party leaders.

Who was this unlikely candidate? Born Alfred Emanuel Smith in 1873, Smith grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His father died when Smith was young, and the boy dropped out of school to take care of the family. At age 21, Smith supported a losing candidate in a local race and came to the attention of New York politicos, who took him under their wing. Nine years later, he ran successfully for the New York State Assembly, where he rapidly rose in the ranks to become Majority Leader and finally Speaker. He played a pivotal role in the revamping of New York's constitution, was elected sheriff of New York County, and then ran for governor in 1918, winning handily. Although he lost a re-election bid two years later, he surged back in 1922 and would remain in the governor's seat for six more years. His terms were marked by unparalleled improvements in labor laws and laws protecting civil liberties, for Smith's goal was to support those he saw as most in need of government's assistance.

In this goal, he was allied with Franklin Roosevelt, and the two were close enough that Roosevelt nominated Smith for president in 1924. The Drys, or Prohibitionists, backed William McAdoo, a son-in-law of former President Woodrow Wilson. Smith's supporters and McAdoo's supporters were so far apart that finally a compromise candidate, John Davis, was nominated and promptly lost the general election to Calvin Coolidge.

In 1928, Smith received his party's nomination on the second ballot, but along with his anti-Prohibition leanings, his religion became a major issue during the campaign, paving the way for Herbert Hoover to win the general election. Meanwhile, Smith had arranged for the nomination of his New York colleague, Franklin Roosevelt, to be governor of New York. Although Smith lost his bid, Roosevelt did not. Then came the Depression and the election of 1932. Backroom dealings ensured that Franklin Roosevelt won the nominating process, with another would-be presidential candidate in the vice-presidential spot on the ticket. Smith was left out in the cold on his third try for the presidency. Despite his former regard for Roosevelt, he began to work hard, if unsuccessfully, to defeat the New Deal. He supported two Republicans rather than Roosevelt in the 1936 and 1940 elections, and he died in 1944, a man who had never reached his desired goal, yet had inspired many of the changes for which his rival is now known.

38. One important argument of the final paragraph is that:
A. Roosevelt would have done better with Smith at his side.
B. The New Deal was anathema to someone with Smith's ideals.
C. Smith's background made him an improbable candidate.
D. Smith deserves credit for many of Roosevelt's successes.

39. The passage implies that being from New York City is bad for a national candidate because:
A. Urban candidates have trouble relating to those in the heartland.
B. New York is perceived as too different from the rest of the country.
C. Westerners rarely support or give money to eastern candidates.
D. New York is the center of liberalism, but candidates must be neutral.

40. The passage suggests that Roosevelt's change of heart toward Smith was influenced by:
A. ethics
B. spitefulness
C. miscommunication
D. ambition

41. The mention of nativists shows primarily that:
A. Only those born in the United States are eligible for the presidency.
B. Bigotry figured into politics in the early twentieth century.
C. Prohibition was a critical issue for many urban voters.
D. A candidate for national office must embrace religion.

Questions 45-49 are based on the following passage.

Passage VIII

Fifty years ago, only New Yorkers lived in what is now termed a megacity, an agglomeration of more than 10 million people living and working in an urban environment. In contrast, today there are more than 40 megacities, most in less developed countries, and more urban centers are expected to explode in population by the year 2020. Demographers and globalization experts are already referring to the 21 st century as "the urban century."

Already, more people on our Earth live in cities than live in rural areas. This is an enormous change in population trends, and it skews the entire planet in ways we haven't begun to analyze.

Although some cities have seen immigration expand their borders, for most megacities, it is migration from within the country that has caused the city to grow. An example is China, where some 150 million rural inhabitants have migrated to cities in just the last 10 years. In many cases, the cities house the only possibilities of employment in this global economy. That is what has grown Mumbai (Bombay), India, from a large city to a megacity of more than 18 million people in just a few years. It's the cause of the explosion of populations in Lagos, Nigeria; Karachi, Pakistan; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Jakarta, Indonesia.

Whereas just a few years ago, most large cities were in developed nations, now the largest are suddenly in the less developed countries of South America, Africa, and Asia. Imagine the pressure on the infrastructure of these already poor cities as the influx of workers pushes services to the breaking point. Slums and shantytowns spring up around the outskirts of the cities, and government is powerless to affect the disadvantaged workers, leaving them exposed to corrupt local officials or urban gangs. Imagine, too, what happens in the rural areas that these people have abandoned. China faces a desperate shortage of agricultural labor. So do other areas of Asia and Africa.

According to United Nations (UN) statistics, by the year 2030, more than 60 percent of the world population will be urban, up from 30 percent in 1950 . Unlike the population growth in developed nations, the birth rate in less developed nations is high, meaning that the cities continue to grow even as migration slows from the rural areas. Megacities such as New York have populations that have leveled off over time. Despite its location in a less developed nation, even a megacity such as Mexico City has a slow rate of growth compared to Asian and African cities such as Mumbai or Lagos.

It is difficult to imagine what the growth of the megacities will mean to the world in the 21st century. Demographers foresee ecological overload, homelessness, uncontrolled traffic, and an infrastructure strained to the breaking point. Despite the notion that industrial jobs improve the lot of the workers, it is already possible to see that megacities are creating a new, even deeper division between rich and poor, as the poor concentrate in the outskirts of town and the rich barricade themselves behind walls and in towers.

45. The main argument of the passage is that:
A. Megacities are more often found in less developed nations but strain the resources of developed nations.
B. The growth in population and number of megacities means foreseeable changes, many of them negative.
C. The movement of population bases from rural to urban locations decimates the countryside and limits our ability to grow food.
D. We must begin to fight back against the growth of megacities in the less devel- oped nations of the world.

46. The passage suggests that demographers:
A. have not been able to keep pace with the growth of cities
B. focus primarily on population trends in the developing world
C. are observing the growth of the world's cities with concern
D. work hand in hand with the UN to plan for the future

47. The author's use of UN statistics helps:
A. strengthen the argument that urbanization is radically changing the world
B. contradict demographers' claims about megacities and their effects
C. indicate that the results of urbanization include poverty and crime
D. complement the assertion that birth rate is the main reason for urban growth

48. According to this passage, why might skyscrapers be a sign of divisiveness?
A. They cost too much to build.
B. They are found only in developed nations.
C. They separate rich from poor.
D. They house businesses, not people.

49. Which new information, if true, might CHALLENGE the author's contention that cities will continue to grow despite a slowing of migration from the countryside?
A. Scientists are creating new strains of rice and wheat that require far less in the way of hands-on care.
B. The number of people living below the poverty level will climb in less devel- oped and developed nations.
C. Inflationary trends in heating oil and gasoline prices will limit most people's discretionary spending.
D. New methods of birth control will limit the population explosion in the devel- oping world.

Passage IX

Muralism has long been a Mexican tradition, perhaps dating back to the Aztecs, who recorded their history on the walls of their pyramids. The covering of a white wall with political art made the careers of David Alfara Siqueiros, Jose Clemente Orozco, and the best known of them all, Diego Rivera.

Siqueiros, born in Chihuahua, studied art from an early age. He organized a student strike at the age of 15 and later worked to unseat the Mexican dictator Huerta, attaining the rank of captain during the revolution that was taking place. He later brought his tactical knowledge to the world of organized labor, where his activism led to lengthy jail terms. That is where he created some of his finest artworks on canvas. During the 1930s, he went to Spain to join the anti-fascist forces. His life was that of a soldier-artist, and some considered him a dangerous, subversive gangster.

Orozco, too, studied art as a youth and was inspired by the Mexican Revolution. One of his famous murals depicts the Holy Trinity as a worker, a soldier, and a peasant. Later he turned his focus to the dehumanizing effect of large cities on the people who live there. When he wasn't painting vast murals, Orozco was drawing political cartoons.

Rivera, the third of these Mexican Social Realists, los tres grandes, remains the most famous through sheer force of personality. His storytelling, his love affairs, his radicalism, and his love-hate relationship with the land of his birth informed his life and his paintings. He incorporated Mexican folklore and cultural icons into his murals in an effort to educate working people in their own history.

In the Chicano neighborhoods of the southwestern United States, political muralism still explodes onto bare walls in the form of graffiti. Edward Seymour's 1949 invention of canned spray paint provided would-be artists with an easy mode of expression, and the graffiti mural took off as an art form in the 1960s and 1970s. It began as outlaw art, which surely would have appealed to an outlaw such as Siqueiros. Despite the new artists' lack of formal training, some members of the outlaw group managed to create something beautiful while making political statements about poverty, injustice, diversity, and racism.

One extraordinary thing about this kind of public art is that it is truly for everyone. You do not need to enter the halls of a museum to see it; it resides on the walls of your local bodega or school or health clinic; you bounce your ball off of it in the basketball or handball court; you cover it over with posters for your favorite band or flyers about your lost pet.

Certainly, many of the graffiti artists were reviled as nuisances, and their art was erased. For some, however, graffiti would prove a launching point into the world of fine art. Today, modern murals in Austin, San Antonio, Los Angeles, and Tucson, among others, attest to the power of the Mexican tradition of the muralist as purveyor of political thought. 50.

Generally, lipids contain the same three elements. Proteins always contain $\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{H}$, and $\mathrm{N}$ and perhaps some other elements depending on the amino acids used. Nucleic acids contain $\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{N}$, and phosphorus.

4. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This problem requires a Punnett square to be performed for each generation. For the first generation, the Punnett square for the genetic cross of $T T \times t t$ is:

In the first generation, the $T$ and $t$ gametes unite to produce individuals with a $T t$ (heterozygous) genotype. In the second generation, the Punnett square is conducted for the genetic cross of $T t \times T t$ :

MCAT

Practice Test 3

Passage I The phenotypic results from this cross are that three of the four pea plants will be tall ( $T T, T t$, and $T t$ ) and one of the four is short $(t t)$. Thus, the phenotypic ratio of dominant to recessive pea plants is $3: 1$, given by choice C.

5. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. If a person has cystic fibrosis, his or her CFTR gene is mutated and produces a faulty version of the CFTR protein. Increasing the production of the mutated CFTR would not improve the condition. The passage indicates that some mutations of CFTR produce proteins that are misdirected and destroyed instead of being sent to the cell membrane. A drug that stops the destruction of CFTR might sound helpful; but if it doesn't also get the CFTR to the membrane where it is needed, it won't be beneficial. Increasing nutrient absorption in the small intestine would be helpful in countering some of the malnutrition problems that cystic fibrosis patients often have. However, it would lead to an improvement only in that one symptom. Activating an additional chloride channel other than CFTR might help restore ion and water balance to produce mucus of the appropriate consistency.

6. The correct answer is C. A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides found on the mRNA that specifies particular amino acids to be added to a protein. The genetic code lists all possible codons. One codon always specifies one amino acid. If the protein is 1480 amino acids long, you might suspect that the mRNA had 1480 codons. However, an additional codon would be present that served as the stop codon. The stop codon does not code for an amino acid, but instead signals the end of translation and the release of the protein. Therefore, 1481 codons would be present on the mRNA.

7. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Carriers are heterozygotes. In the case of recessive inheritance, a carrier will not necessarily know that they are carrying a single allele for the disease. When two heterozygotes are crossed in a Punnett square, the result is that $25 \%$ will be homozygous dominant (normal), $50 \%$ will be heterozygous carriers, and $25 \%$ will be homozygous recessive and will have cystic fibrosis.

8. The correct answer is A. Trypsin is a proteinase produced by the pancreas and secreted into the small intestine. It is involved in protein digestion, so if the levels were reduced, proteins would not be well digested. Amylase is the enzyme involved in carbohydrate digestion, and lipases are involved in the digestion of fats.

9. The correct answer is D. This question is simply asking about the function of mitochondria in the cell. Mitochondria are involved in aerobic respiration and are the site of the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain. Aerobic cellular respiration produces large amounts of ATP. Therefore, the more mitochondria a cell has, the more ATP it can produce. Cells with higher ATP demands should have more mitochondria than cells with lower ATP demands.

10. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Men pass on their genetic contribution to the next generation via sperm. Any mitochondria present in sperm typically do not enter the cell. The passage indicates that all mitochondria in a given cell are derived from those in the egg cell. Because a male does not pass on any of his mitochondria to the next generation, even if he has an mtDNA disease, he could never pass it on to his children. Only when the mtDNA of the egg cell is affected can the disease be passed on.

11. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question relies on some basic knowledge of endosymbiotic theory. Choice A suggests that this theory is supported because mitochondria are membrane bound. Because cells have many other membrane-bound organelles, this would not provide any compelling evidence for the mitochondria being unique. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ indicates that because mitochondria are found in multiple copies within a cell, this would be evidence to support endosymbiosis. Because other organelles are found in multiple copies, this would not be a plausible explanation. The best choice to support the idea that mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotic cells is that they have their own DNA. The passage explains that the mtDNA is circular, which corresponds to the typical DNA conformation in bacteria. Because mitochondria have their own DNA and it resembles that of prokaryotes, choice B would lend the best support to the endosymbiotic theory.

12. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The question explains that mtDNA comes from a single source, which you know is the mother. In the nucleus of diploid cells, each gene is present in duplicate copies that can recombine during crossing over. Because mtDNA comes from a single source, recombination should not occur. The remaining choices listed, such as transcription and translation, should still be able to happen within the mitochondria. Any DNA is subject to spontaneous mutation, including the mtDNA.

13. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. Viagra works by increasing NO activity. The NOS enzyme is responsible for the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. Something antagonistic to L-arginine would mean that less would be available to convert to L-citrulline and NO. Decreasing NOS activity would decrease NO. The passage explains that cGMP is needed to modulate the activity of NO. Decreasing cGMP would decrease NO activity. The PDE enzyme degrades cGMP, which in turn decreases NO activity. If the PDE enzyme were to be inhibited, cGMP could work longer and NO activity would increase.

14. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Because you know that guanine is a nucleotide, it can be deduced that cyclic guanine monophosphate is some variant of a nucleotide.

15. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Because $\mathrm{NO}$ is a gas with a half-life of just a few seconds, it seems impossible for NO to be in these supplements. The PDE enzyme would degrade cGMP and decrease the amount of NO produced. The best explanation is that the supplements contain the precursor to NO, which is L-arginine. Once ingested, the L-arginine could potentially be converted to L-citrulline and NO in the cells. Answers and Explanations Passage III MCAT

Practice Test 3 16. The correct answer is A. Nitroglycerin and erectile dysfunction drugs both have similar effects in that they are vasodilators, which increase blood flow to specific areas in the body. Taking both could dilate the vessels to a point where blood pressure drops critically low. With extreme hypotension, tissues and organs become oxygen deprived.

No Passage 17. The correct answer is A. Because the 3' end of mRNA aligns with the 5' end of DNA in transcription, the complementary base sequence of the mRNA, reading from the mRNA's 3' end, will be G-U-A. Note that uracil is substituted for thymine in RNA. Because the 5' end of tRNA aligns with the 3' end of mRNA, the tRNA base sequence, from the tRNA's 5' end, will be C-A-U. Except for the substitution of uracil, anticodons are the same as the original DNA triplets they are translating.

18. The correct answer is C. Chain growth in DNA replication is initiated by a primase and is extended by a DNA polymerase. Thus the enzyme acting between Initiation $\rightarrow$ Elongation is DNA polymerase.

19. The correct answer is A. Topoisomerases are enzymes that cut one of the DNA strands so that it can begin to unwind and serve to relieve pressure in the coil caused by its unwinding. Thus the enzyme acting between Double helix $\rightarrow$ Nicking of a strand is topoisomerase.

20. The correct answer is D. Abutting segments of unjoined DNA can be annealed by ligases. Thus the enzyme acting between Elongation $\rightarrow$ Closing of nicks is $D N A$ ligase.

No Passage 21. The correct answer is C. The majority of the cell cycle is spent in interphase, which consists of three stages: G1, S, and G2. In the G1 stage of interphase, the cell organelles are doubled, and materials required for DNA synthesis are accumulated for the onset of cell division. The $\mathrm{S}$ stage of interphase is the stage of the cell cycle where the amount of DNA doubles with the replication of chromosomes. In the G2 stage of interphase, which follows the synthesis of DNA, proteins required for the next cell division are synthesized. Metaphase is the stage in mitosis characterized by the precise lineup of the chromosomes along the equatorial plane.

22. The correct answer is A. Osmosis is a specialized form of diffusion, or passive transport. During osmosis, water always moves from the side of the membrane that has more water to the side of the membrane that has less water. The only thing that moves by osmosis is water. This means that choice B can be eliminated because solutes are not moving by osmosis. If there is a concentration difference across the membrane, there will be water movement, which eliminates choice $\mathrm{C}$. When osmosis occurs, water moves from the side of the membrane that has more water to the side that has less water. This means that the side of the membrane with more water has less solute (and is therefore less concentrated) than the side of the membrane with less water and more solute (being more concentrated). Based on the choices provided, choice A is the most appropriate. 23. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have several structures in common. In order to determine that a cell is eukaryotic, structures that are unique to eukaryotic cells must be identified. Ribosomes perform protein synthesis and can be found in all cells. The cell membrane is the outer boundary of the cell and is also found in all types of cells. DNA serves as the genetic material found in all cell types. Mitochondria (choice D) are true bound organelles that perform the process of cellular respiration. Because they are true organelles, they are found only in eukaryotic cells.

24. The correct answer is D. Connective tissues are characterized by cells scattered in a nonliving matrix. This matrix often consists of collagen fibers. Muscle has the ability to contract, whereas epithelial cells are characterized by cells arranged in sheets and a basement membrane.

25. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. A bacterial cell performing anaerobic respiration would perform a fermentation step following glycolysis. The Krebs cycle and electron transport chain are associated with aerobic cellular respiration.

26. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question is asking for a comparison between the organization of DNA in bacteria and eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic DNA exists in multiple linear pieces termed chromosomes. Bacterial DNA consists of a single loop of DNA. Although bacteria can have extra chromosomal DNA known as plasmids, this is not the case for all bacteria. RNA is single stranded, but it is not the primary genetic material of the cells and is only produced during transcription.

27. The correct answer is A. Once taken inside a cell, foreign items can be broken down in the lysosomes of the cell. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for lipid synthesis, and the rough endoplasmic reticulum deals in protein labeling. The Golgi apparatus sorts and modifies contents from the endoplasmic reticulum.

28. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. All of the given choices would give support to the endosymbiotic theory. The subunit sizes of bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes are known to be different. Bacterial cell membranes have some different properties as compared to their eukaryotic counterparts. Because plasmids are unique to bacteria, finding them in the chloroplasts or mitochondria would support the idea that these structures were once prokaryotic in nature.

29. The correct answer is A. Retroviruses are unique in that they enter their host as RNA but must convert themselves to DNA to enter the latent phase and insert into the host's chromosomes, which are also DNA. This is indicated by choice A. This conversion of RNA to DNA is carried out by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The question is asking specifically about retroviruses, so choices B and C can be eliminated, as they are not unique to the retrovirus family. Choice D indicates that the retrovirus needs to recombine with the host chromosomes. Recombination Answers and Explanations Passage IV

Passage $\mathrm{V}$ MCAT

Practice Test 3 implies genetic exchange between the two sources. Although the viral genetic material will insert into a proto-oncogene of the host, there will not be an exchange of DNA.

30. The correct answer is A. The passage describes the function of the four genes found in RSV. Packaging of viruses for release involves the viral envelope and capsid, which implicates the gag gene and the $e n v$ gene. The pol gene codes for reverse transcriptase, which converts viral RNA to DNA and is not needed for the packaging viruses. The $s r c$ gene encodes for tyrosine kinase. Kinases phosphorylate other molecules, which would not be part of the viral packaging process.

31. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Oncogenes develop when a proto-oncogene activates. In order for a virus to carry an oncogene into its host, that virus must be derived from a virus that picked up the gene from a former host cell. Spontaneous mutation alone could not account for a virus acquiring an entire proto-oncogene, which eliminates choice A. Viruses do not conjugate, so choice B can be eliminated as well. Transformation occurs when a cell incorporates foreign DNA from its environment into its own genome. This occurs with bacteria but not viruses, meaning that choice $\mathrm{C}$ can also be eliminated. This leaves transduction as the only choice. When a virus excises from the host chromosome, it can take with it genes from the host's chromosome. A virus could feasibly acquire an activated oncogene when excising from its host, and this gene could be transferred to a new host.

32. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. This question is essentially asking how a cancerous cell could have its cell division halted. Because cancer is characterized by uncontrolled mitosis, the best way to halt the cancer would be to halt mitosis. Disrupting protein synthesis, or aerobic cellular respiration, would not directly affect cell division, so these choices can be eliminated. Introducing additional growth factors to the cell would only increase the rate of cell division, which is the opposite of what this question is asking. The only feasible choice would be to interfere with the microtubules (spindle fibers) and halt mitosis.

Passage VI 33. The correct answer is B. For this question, the best strategy is to find the most logical-sounding answer. Choice A suggests that antibiotics cause the mutation rate to increase. You have no evidence to support this assertion; therefore, this choice should be eliminated. Choice $C$ suggests that antibiotics increase the rate of reproduction in bacteria. Again, you have no evidence to support this. Choice D can be eliminated because other choices have already been found incorrect. This leaves choice B as your answer. The antibiotics will kill all but the resistant bacteria, leaving them to multiply and lead to a new generation of resistant bacteria.

34. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question is asking about a basic knowledge of bacterial conjugation. During conjugation, a bacterial cell copies a plasmid and transfers that plasmid to a recipient that is lacking the plasmid. Because the question tells you that the resistance genes are often passed by conjugation and you know conjugation passes plasmids, you can assume that the resistance genes are located on plasmids.

35. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question requires you to locate the most logical explanation as to why antibiotic genes are often purposefully transferred along with a gene of interest in biotechnology procedures. Because the question does not provide information on what type of cells are being transformed, don't assume anything. Choice A suggests that you need resistance genes transferred so the cells can survive in the presence of antibiotics. If the cells transformed are not bacterial, they would survive anyway, as antibiotics would target and kill only bacteria. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ suggests that the antibiotic genes are transferred out of convenience because they happen to be near the gene of interest. If the gene of interest is not coming from bacteria, then there could not be any antibiotic resistance genes nearby. Choice D really doesn't offer much in the way of logic, suggesting that antibiotic resistance would be necessary to prevent infection in transformed cells. The only logical explanation is choice B. In order to determine if a cell was transformed with the gene of interest or not, antibiotics could be added. The transformed cells that picked up the gene of interest would also pick up the antibiotic resistance marker and would grow in the presence of antibiotics. The nontransformed cells would not be resistant to the antibiotics and would be killed.

36. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Of the choices listed, only the ribosomes are structurally different between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Although both eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomes have a small and large subunit, the sizes of these subunits are different in prokaryotic cells.

37. The correct answer is A. The karyotype is the characteristic morphology of a species's chromosome set. The normal karyotype for humans consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes. The 23rd pair constitutes the sex chromosomes, which consist of a pair of $\mathrm{X}$ chromosomes in the female or an $\mathrm{X}$ and $\mathrm{Y}$ chromosome in the male. In Klinefelter's syndrome, males exhibit an altered karyotype in that they possess a third X chromosome.

38. The correct answer is C. Mitosis is the process during which chromosomes are distributed evenly to two new cells that arise from the parent cell undergoing division. Tetrads, or the formation of four new cells, do not occur during mitosis. Thus the number of tetrads formed during mitosis is 0 .

39. The correct answer is D. During the $\mathrm{S}$ phase of interphase before mitosis proper, each chromosome will have replicated. The two chromosomal strands or chromatids are identical in their genetic material and are joined at a constricted region called the centromere. Within the centromere are one or more rings of protein known as kinetochores, which play a significant role in the attachment of the spindle fibers to the chromosomes.

40. The correct answer is B. Diploid organisms have two sets of 23 chromosomes, with one (haploid) set provided by each parent. Answers and Explanations No Passage MCAT

Practice Test 3

Passage VII 41. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question is asking for a simple understanding of the structures of the peripheral nervous system as compared to the central nervous system. The central nervous system is composed of the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system is composed of nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. Because Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) affects only the peripheral nervous system, the neurons in the central nervous system should be unaffected. Of the choices listed, the neurons of the arms and legs, abdominal cavity, and heart are all part of the peripheral nervous system and subject to GBS. The neurons of the spinal cord are part of the central nervous system and should be unaffected by GBS.

42. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The myelin sheath is used to insulate the axons of neurons. Within the myelin sheath there are gaps, known as nodes of Ranvier, where the myelin is absent. Action potentials move down the axon and jump from one node to the next. When the myelin is removed, the gap from one node to the next becomes so large that the action potential can no longer jump the gap. This means that the action potential never reaches the end of the neuron, and the message is not passed to other neurons. Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is most indicative of this problem. Choice $\mathrm{B}$ suggests that the problem is with the response of muscle cells to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. If the action potential never reaches the end of the neuron, acetylcholine will not be released to the neuromuscular junction; therefore, the issue is not with the muscle cells' response. The sodium-potassium pumps are used to maintain resting potential in neurons, and there is nothing in the passage or question that would indicate that there is a problem with this. Because GBS is not a problem with the central nervous system, there would be no logical reason to assume that the problem is with the brain.

43. The correct answer is C. The passage described Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as a disorder with unknown causes that leads to the production of antibodies from the immune system that attack the peripheral myelin. Because no pattern of inheritance was stated and the disease is unpredictable in terms of who it strikes, there would be no reason to think this is a genetic condition. This allows choices $A$ and $B$ to be eliminated. The passage mentions that GBS can follow an infection in some but not all cases. No other evidence was provided to suggest that GBS is an infection. This leaves choice $\mathrm{C}$ as the best answer. Autoimmune diseases are characterized by an immune response to self-structures. Because the immune system is producing antibodies against the peripheral myelin, this would count as an autoimmune condition.

44. The correct answer is B. The passage described plasmapheresis as the separation of blood and plasma, where the plasma is discarded and the blood cells are returned to the patient as donated or synthetic plasma. If this helps with the symptoms of GBS, this would indicate that something in the plasma is causing the problem. The passage indicated that antibodies against myelin cause the demyelination characteristic of GBS. Plasma cells secrete antibodies into fluids of the body, including plasma. By removing the plasma, the antibody concentration is decreased, leading to a reduced level of attack on peripheral myelin.

45. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. During a muscle contraction, the sarcomeres contract as the result of myosin heads attaching to actin and pulling the fibers inward. In order for this to occur, ATP and calcium are required. If there were excessive amounts of calcium, you would expect more contractions to occur.

46. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. Of the hormones listed, the only one that is involved with water levels and the kidneys is antidiuretic hormone. The hormone increases water reabsorption in the nephrons, increasing blood volume and pressure and decreasing urine volume. Thyroid-stimulating hormone acts on the thyroid gland to regulate metabolism. Glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen to increase blood sugar levels. Calcitonin is used to decrease blood calcium levels and stimulate osteoblasts to build new bone matrix.

47. The correct answer is C. Pulmonary gas exchange is always based on simple diffusion. Diffusion allows for the movement of a substance from an area of high concentration of the substance to an area of low concentration of the substance. Depending on the concentrations, oxygen and carbon dioxide will move in variable directions. Choices A, B, and D indicate that the movement of gases always occurs in a fixed direction, which is incorrect.

48. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The hypothalamus is located in the brain, which allows choice $\mathrm{D}$ to be eliminated immediately. The cerebrum is the largest portion of the brain that is divided into right and left hemispheres, which are connected by the corpus callosum. The processing of conscious thought and sensory information occurs in the cerebrum. The brain stem consists of the pons (connects the spinal cord to the cerebellum), medulla oblongata (reflex centers for vital functions), and reticular activating system (the activating system for the cerebrum). The hypothalamus and thalamus are both located in the diencephalon. The hypothalamus is involved in endocrine regulation as well as regulating conditions such as thirst and hunger.

49. The correct answer is D. According to the data, TSH levels are low and T3 and T4 levels are elevated. Choice B suggests that the problem is related to thyroglobulin levels. Because this is not mentioned in the data, choice B can be eliminated. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ directly contradicts the data. The data shows increased levels of T3 (when compared to expected values), and the choice indicates that T3 levels are decreased. The passage indicates an inverse relationship between TSH and T3/T4. When TSH is high, this is in response to low T3 and T4. When TSH is low, this is in response to high levels of T3 and T4. T3 and T4 directly regulate metabolism, so it makes sense that if their levels are elevated, metabolism increases. This is Answers and Explanations

No Passage

Passage VIII 50. The correct answer is A. To answer this question, you need to be familiar with mechanisms used in the body to maintain calcium homeostasis and bone cell action. The hormones calcitonin and parathyroid hormone both regulate blood calcium levels. Calcitonin, secreted by the thyroid gland, decreases blood calcium by storing excess calcium in bone matrix due to the activity of osteoblasts. Parathyroid hormone, secreted by the parathyroid glands located on top of the thyroid, is antagonistic to calcitonin and increases blood calcium levels. Osteoblasts are bone cells that build bone tissue when there is excess calcium. Their activity is regulated by calcitonin. When active, osteoblasts reduce blood calcium levels. Osteoclasts break down bone tissue and are regulated by parathyroid hormone. When active, osteoclasts increase blood calcium levels. If a patient has had his or her thyroid and parathyroids removed, it would be safe to assume that calcitonin and parathyroid levels would be decreased, making it difficult to regulate blood calcium levels. Choice B suggests that activating osteoblasts would help increase calcium levels. Because osteoblasts build bone and decrease blood calcium, this would actually further decrease the calcium levels in the blood. Taking synthetic calcitonin as suggested by choices $C$ and $D$ would only decrease calcium levels further because calcitonin activates osteoblasts. One potential solution to increase blood calcium levels would be to increase bone matrix breakdown as suggested by choice A. Osteoclasts are the bone cells responsible for this response.

51. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question relies on your knowledge of the endocrine system. The thyroid gland itself produces T3 and T4 that could be involved with hyperthyroidism, thus eliminating choice C. The thyroid is regulated by thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, which eliminates choice B. The anterior pituitary gland is regulated by hormones from the hypothalamus, eliminating choice A. Therefore, the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, and thyroid gland all could potentially have a role in a thyroid problem. The adrenal glands do not secrete any hormones related to thyroid function, making choice $\mathrm{D}$ the correct answer.

52. The correct answer is $D$. This question requires an understanding of the requirements of T3 and T4. Without a certain mineral, neither hormone can function properly. Both T3 and T4 require iodine from the diet to function.

Passage IX 53. The correct answer is C. The passage explains that blood doping is used to increase erythrocyte counts in the athlete. Because the function of erythrocytes and hemoglobin is to carry oxygen, it would be expected that an increase in red blood cell count would allow for more oxygen to be transported. This oxygen would be used for electron transport in aerobic cellular respiration, which produces ATP to be used by the athlete.

54. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. You know that autologous transfusions come from the athlete's own blood and homologous transfusions come from someone else's blood. Just as is the case with any type of transfusion, there can be problems with incompatibilities or with infectious agents that can be transmitted by infected tissues. Whether the blood transfusion is homologous or autologous, there would be no difference in the ability to carry oxygen by the erythrocytes that would provide an athletic advantage. Autologous transfusions would provide no more erythrocytes than a homologous transfusion. In fact, autologous transfusions often contain fewer cells.

55. The correct answer is D. Erythropoietin (EPO) stimulates the cells of the bone marrow to differentiate into new red blood cells. Of the conditions listed, anemia is characterized by a low erythrocyte or hemoglobin count. In this case, additional EPO could stimulate the production of more erythrocytes to correct the condition. Coronary artery disease, hypotension, and renal failure are not associated with erythrocyte deficiencies.

56. The correct answer is B. Once the erythrocytes have been collected, the athlete has a low erythrocyte count. His or her own erythropoietin (EPO) is released to stimulate the production of new cells and return the erythrocyte count to normal within a few weeks (similar to what happens to anyone who donates blood). When the erythrocytes are reinfused in the athlete who already has a normal count, they now have extra erythrocytes that can carry more oxygen in the body and perhaps provide an athletic advantage.

57. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The hormones released by the anterior pituitary gland include growth hormone, prolactin, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, endorphins, enkephalins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone. The hormones released by the posterior pituitary gland include oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone.

58. The correct answer is C. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter found in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Because of its presence and function in the CNS and PNS, the impairment of acetylcholine as a direct result of curare exerts a devastating effect on the human body, that is, paralysis.

59. The correct answer is D. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs. One would therefore expect it to have the lowest oxygen tension. Blood entering the capillaries around the alveoli from the pulmonary artery does, in fact, have a $\mathrm{pO}_{2}$ of around $40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Not surprisingly, because it is the source of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Answers and Explanations 

\section{Section 2. Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems}

1. The correct answer is B. Terminal velocity occurs when the drag force exerted on

Passage I the skydiver becomes equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the skydiver. The drag force develops as the air molecules interact with the surface area of the falling skydiver. The greater the surface area of the skydiver that acts perpendicular to the direction of the skydiver's fall, the greater force will be exerted on the skydiver, resulting in a smaller terminal velocity. To the contrary, the smaller the surface area of the skydiver that acts perpendicular to the direction of the skydiver's fall, the smaller force will be exerted on the skydiver, resulting in a larger terminal velocity. From the orientations presented in the options, the one orientation that translates to the smallest surface area and hence the greatest terminal velocity is given by choice B.

2. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Using the relationship

$$
\text { density }=\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { volume }},
$$

you can determine the mass of the helium used to inflate the balloon from

$$
\text { mass }=(\text { density }) \times(\text { volume })
$$

where density $=0.1785 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and volume $=8.5 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~mL}$, or since $1 \mathrm{~mL}=1 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, volume $=8.5 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { mass } & =\left(0.1785 \frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm}^{3}}\right) \times\left(8.5 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~cm}^{3}\right) \\
& =1.52 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~g} \\
& =1.52 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}
\end{aligned}
$$

The weight of the helium used to inflate the balloon can be determined from

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { weight } & =(\text { mass }) \times(\text { acceleration due to gravity }) \\
& =\left(1.52 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}\right) \times\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right) \\
& =14.9 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~N} \\
& =1.49 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N}

given by choice $\mathrm{C}$.

3. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The initial velocity $\left(v_{i}\right)$ of Felix Baumgartner in the vertical direction is 0 , his final velocity $\left(v_{f}\right)$ is $373 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, and the acceleration due to gravity is $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ (although in reality it is probably slightly lower because of the significantly MCAT

Practice Test 3 large jumping altitude). The equation of motion that can be used to determine the distance traversed by Baumgartner is:

$$
\begin{aligned}

\end{aligned}
$$

4. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. When an object in free fall reaches terminal velocity, it is in equilibrium. In other words, the drag force acting upward becomes equal in magnitude yet opposite in direction to the object's weight, or:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{d} & =F_{g} \\
C v_{t}^{2} & =\mathrm{mg} \\
C & =\frac{\mathrm{mg}}{v_{t}^{2}}=\frac{1,156 \mathrm{~N}}{\left(373 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\right)^{2}}=\frac{1,156 \mathrm{~N}}{139,129 \frac{\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\mathrm{~s}^{2}}}=0.008 \frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{m}}
\end{aligned}
$$

5. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Terminal velocity occurs for a free-falling object when the drag force $\left(F_{d}\right)$ becomes equal in magnitude yet opposite in direction to the object's weight or force due to gravity $\left(F_{g}\right)$. This is depicted by the free body diagram with the two forces, $F_{d}$ and $F_{g}$, drawn as arrows of equal size in opposite directions, given by choice $\mathrm{C}$.

6. The correct answer is A. The longest wavelength will have the lowest frequency and the lowest energy. This lowest energy occurs from the transition from $n=3$ to $n=2$. The relationship can be found in the equation $E=\frac{h c}{\lambda}$. The energy, $E$, of a photon is equal to Planck's constant times the speed of light, divided by the wavelength. As the wavelength increases, the value of the denominator increases, decreasing the value of $E$.

7. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The density of a solution can be determined from $\rho=m / V$, where $\rho$ is the density of the solution (in units of $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ), $m$ is the mass of the solution (in units of $\mathrm{g}$ ), and $V$ is the volume of the solution (in units of $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ). The mass of the solution, $m_{\text {sol }}$, is the total mass of the solution and the syringe, $m_{\text {tot }}$, minus the mass of the syringe, $m_{\mathrm{syr}}$, or

$$
\begin{aligned}
& m_{\mathrm{tot}}=m_{\mathrm{sol}}+m_{\mathrm{syr}} \\
& m_{\mathrm{sol}}=m_{\mathrm{tot}}-m_{\mathrm{syr}}=80 \mathrm{~g}-5 \mathrm{~g}=75 \mathrm{~g}
\end{aligned}
$$

The volume of the solution in the syringe is $V_{\mathrm{syr}}=30 \mathrm{~mL}=30 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. The density of the solution is:

$$
\rho=\frac{m}{V}=\frac{75 \mathrm{~g}}{30 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}=2.5 \frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm}^{3}}
$$

8. The correct answer is B. Realizing that the atomic mass is almost at the midpoint value of the two isotopes, you can conclude that the approximate abundance is about $50 \%$ for each isotope. This comes closest to choice B. To check, take the relative abundance for each isotope and multiply by the mass number for that isotope. Doing so gives the following: $(0.507)(79)+(0.493)(81)=40.053+39.933=79.986$. Considering that there will always be some error in analysis, this is the closest choice to the atomic mass of bromine.

9. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. There are four combinations for the bromine atoms: Br-79 and Br-79 (=158), Br-79 and Br-81 ( $=160), \mathrm{Br}-81$ and Br-79 ( $=160)$, and Br-81 and Br-81 (=162). An $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{z}$ ratio of 160 will be detected $50 \%$ of the time, whereas the other two $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{z}$ ratios occur $25 \%$ of the time each.

10. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The electron configuration for bromine is $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{6} 3 s^{2} 3 p^{6}$ $4 s^{2} 3 d^{10} 4 p^{5}$. Whereas a bromine atom has an unpaired electron, $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ does not. Because there are no unpaired electrons, it will be diamagnetic. $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ will not be polar because it is diatomic and both atoms have the same electronegativity. Finally, looking at the trend down the halogen family, $\mathrm{F}_{2}$ will be a gas, as will $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, because of their low atomic masses and low dispersion force attractions. Because $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ has the greater mass, its dispersion forces allow it to be a solid at room temperature. As per the passage, bromine is a liquid and will be less dense than iodine.

11. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The general trend is that $Z_{\text {eff }}$ will increase moving down a family and from left to right across a period. However, because the number of core electrons remains constant while one goes from left to right in a period, the nuclear charge will increase and have a greater effect on the valence electrons. The impact of effective nuclear charge will be greater when moving left to right than from top to bottom on the periodic table.

12. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. When ${ }_{35}^{80} \mathrm{Br}$ undergoes positron decay, the result is ${ }_{+1}^{0} e+$ ${ }_{34}^{80} \mathrm{Se}$. In order to achieve ${ }_{36}^{80} \mathrm{Kr}$, two more modes of beta decay need to occur as per the following:

$$
{ }_{34}^{80} \mathrm{Se} \rightarrow{ }_{-1}^{0} e+{ }_{35}^{80} \mathrm{Br} \quad \text { and } \quad{ }_{35}^{80} \mathrm{Br} \rightarrow{ }_{-1}^{0} e+{ }_{36}^{80} \mathrm{Kr}
$$

13. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This problem can be solved by substituting the results of each scenario into Poiseuille's law and searching for the smallest value. Choice A yields an 8-fold increase in flow. Choice B results in a 32-fold decrease in flow. Choice $C$ yields a 32-fold increase in flow, and choice D results in an 8-fold decrease in flow.

14. The correct answer is A. By definition of the two types of lenses, a concave lens increases the focal length of an image, whereas a convex lens reduces the focal Answers and Explanations

Passage II No Passage MCAT

Practice Test 3 length of an image. Therefore, choices $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{C}$ are incorrect and can be immediately excluded. Because myopia results in image formation in front of the retina, the appropriate corrective lens would be a concave lens, which increases the focal length of the image, causing the image to focus past this point and on the retina. Choice A is the correct response. Choice D represents the corrective approach for hyperopia, or farsightedness.

15. The correct answer is D. The electrostatic force can be calculated using Coulomb's law:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F & =k \frac{q_{e} q_{p}}{r_{\mathrm{ep}}^{2}}=\left(9 \times 10^{9} \frac{\mathrm{N} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2}}{\mathrm{C}^{2}}\right) \frac{\left(-1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(+1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right)}{\left(5.3 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~m}\right)^{2}} \\
& =-8.2 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

represented by choice $\mathrm{D}$.

Passage III 16. The correct answer is A. In single-slit diffraction, light (electromagnetic radiation) passes through a small slit within a diffraction grating and moves toward a screen as wavefronts. As the wavefronts strike the screen, points within the wavefronts will either amplify as a result of constructive interference or cancel each other as a result of destructive interference. The alternating patterns of constructive and destructive interference will result in a pattern of bright and dark fringes on the screen. This observation is indicative of the wavelike behavior of light. Compton scattering involves a two-dimensional elastic collision that can take place only if particles are involved. An electron is a particle, and thus in order to observe the Compton effect, light (electromagnetic radiation) must also behave as a particle.

17. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The interference pattern described in Fraunhofer singleslit diffraction is based on the fact that light behaves as waves. Wavefronts passing through the slit move toward the screen and, depending on the position of the wavefronts, an interference pattern consisting of alternating maxima and minima will result. If the source were composed of particles, the resultant image would depict a linear array of points, consistent with the geometrical constraints of the slit, as illustrated in choice A.

18. The correct answer is D. In Compton scattering, a two-dimensional elastic collision occurs between a photon with an incident energy, $E_{\mathrm{ph}}$, and an electron at rest. As the photon collides with the electron, it scatters at some angle $\theta$ after transferring a portion of its energy to the electron, which in turn causes it to scatter with an energy, $E_{\mathrm{el}}$, at some angle $\varphi$. The energy of the scattered photon, $E_{\mathrm{ph}}^{\prime}$, is less than the original energy of the photon. From the relation

$$
E=h v=h \frac{c}{\lambda},
$$

you can see that a reduced energy implies a lower frequency (because energy is directly proportional to frequency) and a longer wavelength (because energy is inversely proportional to wavelength). 19. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This problem requires the application of the conservation of energy:

$$
\begin{gathered}
(\text { total energy })_{\text {before collision }}=(\text { total energy })_{\text {after collision }} \\
\left(E_{\mathrm{ph}}+E_{\mathrm{el}}\right)_{\text {before collision }}=\left(E_{\mathrm{ph}}^{\prime}+E_{\mathrm{el}}^{\prime}\right)_{\text {after collision }}
\end{gathered}
$$

Although the collision is two-dimensional, only the conservation of energy in the $x$-direction allows one to develop a relationship between the energy of the Compton-scattered electron and the energy of the incident and scattered photon:

$$
\left(E_{\mathrm{ph}}+0\right)_{\text {before collision }}=\left(E_{\mathrm{ph}}^{\prime} \cos (-\theta)+E_{\mathrm{el}}^{\prime} \cos (\phi)\right)_{\text {after collision }}
$$

$E_{\mathrm{el}}=0$ because the electron before the collision is at rest. Because cosine is an even function, $\cos (-\theta)=\cos (\theta)$. Therefore,

$$
E_{\mathrm{ph}}=E_{\mathrm{ph}}^{\prime} \cos (\theta)+E_{\mathrm{el}}^{\prime} \cos (\phi)
$$

Solving for $E_{\mathrm{el}}^{\prime}$ yields

$$
E_{\mathrm{el}}^{\prime}=\frac{\left[E_{\mathrm{ph}}-E_{\mathrm{ph}}^{\prime} \cos (\theta)\right]}{\cos (\phi)}
$$

20. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This problem can be solved through the use of unit analysis. The units for Planck's constant, $h$, are $J \cdot s$, wavelength, $\lambda$, is $m$, and frequency, $v$, is $1 / \mathrm{s}$. The question is which combination of these units will yield the units of momentum $\left(\frac{\mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}\right)$. The term that has units of momentum is $\mathrm{h} / \lambda$.

21. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The spring constant, $k$, which is a constant unique to an Passage IV elastic object that describes the amount of force required to stretch or compress the elastic object by a known distance, can be determined from the data displayed in the first table. Plotting the data with the elastic force, $F_{\mathrm{el}}$, on the $y$-axis and stretching distance, $x_{\mathrm{el}}$, on the $x$-axis, the spring constant can be found by taking the slope of the graph. Because the data indicates a linear graph, the slope and thus the spring constant can be found by using the endpoints:

$$
k=\text { slope }=\frac{\text { rise }}{\text { run }}=\frac{\Delta F_{\mathrm{el}}}{\Delta x_{\mathrm{el}}}=\frac{5 N-2 N}{0.3 m-0.14 m}=\frac{3 N}{0.16 m}=18.75 \frac{N}{m}
$$

22. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The work done in pulling back the slingshot is stored as elastic potential energy, which in turn is transferred to kinetic energy of the moving projectile. Applying the work-kinetic energy theorem:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Work } & =\text { Elastic Potential Energy }=\text { Change in Kinetic Energy } \\
& =\frac{1}{2} k x_{\mathrm{el}}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{o}^{2} \\
v_{f}^{2} & =\frac{k}{m} x_{\mathrm{el}}^{2} \quad v_{f}=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} x_{\mathrm{el}}

$$

$$

24. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The horizontal landing distance, $\Delta x$, can be determined from the equation:

$$
\Delta x=v_{x} \Delta t
$$

From the response to Question 21, the horizontal velocity that the marble leaves the tabletop with is given by:

$$
v_{f}=v_{x}=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} x_{\mathrm{el}}
$$

The time can be found using the equation for displacement in the $y$-direction for accelerated motion:

$$
\Delta y=\frac{1}{2} g \Delta t^{2}
$$

Solving for $\Delta t$ yields:

$$
\Delta t=\sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta y}{g}}
$$

Substituting into the previous expression for the horizontal landing distance gives:

$$
\Delta x=v_{x} \Delta t=\left[\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} x_{\mathrm{el}}\right]\left[\sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta y}{g}}\right]
$$

25. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The students are being asked to extrapolate from the data points already collected and displayed in the second table. Performing simple linear regression analysis, the graphed data reveals the following graph of a line:

$$
y=88.3 x+0.895
$$

Substituting the value of $10 \mathrm{~cm}$ or $0.1 \mathrm{~m}$ into the regression line for $x$, the $y$-value, or the observed value the students should expect to see when the slingshot is pulled back, to $10 \mathrm{~cm}$ is:

$$
y=88.3(0.10)+0.895=9.73 \mathrm{~m}
$$

26. The correct answer is A. Using the expression for the horizontal landing distance:

$$
\Delta x=v_{x} \Delta t=\left[\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} x_{\mathrm{el}}\right]\left[\sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta y}{g}}\right]
$$

if the mass of the marble were doubled,

$$
\Delta x=v_{x} \Delta t=\left[\sqrt{\frac{k}{2 m}} x_{\mathrm{el}}\right]\left[\sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta y}{g}}\right]
$$

So, in comparison to the original mass of the marble, the horizontal landing distance would decrease by $\sqrt{2}$.

27. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The answer choices are best considered as two sets of two: two boat conformations and two chair conformations. Boat conformations in general are almost always of higher energy due to the so-called flagpole interactions shown here:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_348ed3fba27176ba009dg-37.jpg?height=105&width=195&top_left_y=842&top_left_x=846)

The distinguishing characteristic between the two chair conformations is that one (choice C) places the chlorine substituent in an equatorial attitude, whereas the other (choice D) forces the substituent to occupy an axial position. An equatorial orientation is almost always energetically preferable.

28. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. In the decay process of thallium-201, given in the pas- Passage $\mathbf{V}$ sage as

$$
{ }_{81}^{201} \mathrm{Tl}+{ }_{-1}^{0} e \rightarrow{ }_{80}^{201} \mathrm{Hg}+{ }_{0}^{0} v
$$

it can be seen that the mass number of Tl-201 $(A=201)$ is identical to the mass number of Hg-201 $(A=201)$, the atomic number of Tl-201 $(Z=81)$ is greater than the atomic number of $\operatorname{Hg}-201(Z=80)$, and the neutron number of Tl-201 $(N=201-81=120)$ is smaller than the neutron number of Hg-201 $(N=201-80=$ 121). Thus, $A$ remains constant, $N$ increases by one, and $Z$ decreases by one. Choice B is the correct choice.

29. The correct answer is $A$. The wavelength of the gamma ray is equal to its energy by the relation:

$$
E=h c / \lambda
$$

where $E$ is the energy of the electromagnetic radiation (in units of $\mathrm{eV}$ ), $h$ is Planck's constant $\left(=4.15 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{eV} \cdot \mathrm{sec}\right), c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum $\left(=3.0 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\right)$, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

$$
\lambda=h \frac{c}{E}=\left(4.15 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{eV} \cdot \mathrm{s}\right) \frac{\left(3.0 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\right)}{\left(167 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{eV}\right)}=0.074 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}=0.074 \AA
$$

30. The correct answer is B. The energy, wavelength, frequency, and speed are related by:

$$
E=h v=h \frac{c}{\lambda}
$$

Because gamma rays have higher energy than x-rays and frequency is linearly proportional to the energy, the frequency is larger as well. Because the wavelength is No Passage Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 3 inversely proportional to energy, the wavelength decreases as the energy increases. The speed of the x-rays, which is the same speed for the gamma ray, is the speed of light in a vacuum and is constant. Thus, choice B is the correct answer.

31. The correct answer is D. This problem is solved using the radioactive decay equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
N & =N_{o} e^{-\left(\frac{0.693}{T_{1 / 2}}\right) \cdot t} \\
\frac{N}{N_{O}} & =e^{-\left(\frac{0.693}{73 h r}\right) \cdot 24 h r}=e^{-0.22}=0.80
\end{aligned}
$$

Expressed in percentage, the fraction N/No is $80 \%$.

32. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This problem is solved using the radioactive decay equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
N & =N_{O} e^{-\left(\frac{0.693}{T_{1 / 2}}\right) \cdot t} \\
\frac{N}{N_{O}} & =0.10=e^{-\left(\frac{0.693}{73 h r}\right) \cdot t}=e^{-(0.0095 / h r) \cdot t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields:

$$
\begin{aligned}
-2.3 & =-(0.0095 / \mathrm{hr}) \cdot t \\
t & =\frac{2.3}{0.0095 / \mathrm{hr}}=242 \mathrm{hr} \approx 10.1 \text { days }
\end{aligned}
$$

Passage VI 33. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. When writing the $K_{\text {eq }}$ for a reaction, you need to remember "products over reactants, coefficients become powers." Looking at the reaction in reverse, ammonia is the reactant and the nitrogen and hydrogen gases are the products. This is best demonstrated by choice $\mathrm{B}$.

34. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. Because the reaction is exothermic, the addition or presence of heat (a product) will cause more products to be present. More products present will mean that the reaction will shift to produce more reactants. This is why it is vital to cool the ammonia once it is formed. The next two choices favor the reaction to proceed to the right. Choice $\mathrm{D}$, the catalyst, has no effect on the point of equilibrium. However, the catalyst will help equilibrium be achieved faster.

35. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The addition of a catalyst will lower the activation energy by producing an alternative pathway for the reaction to proceed. This makes the potential energy of the activated complex lower. Because the potential energy of the reactants and products does not change, the heat of reaction will not change as well.

36. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The rate-determining step is the slowest of the elementary steps of the reaction. The reaction has to overcome the triple-bonded nitrogen to form nitrogen atoms that need to react. This is why the $79 \%$ of the atmosphere that is nitrogen gas is considered inert (for the most part). 37. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Because the reaction is exothermic, the increase in temperature will drive the equilibrium to the left. This causes more reactants to form. A greater concentration of reactants means a greater value in the denominator of the $K_{\mathrm{eq}}$ expression and a lower $K_{\mathrm{eq}}$ value.

38. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question touches on four different definitions of acids and bases. Although they do not replace each other, they do enhance each other, depending upon the conditions. Choice A is the classic Arrhenius definition in which $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$neutralize to form water. Choice B shows a proton transfer and demonstrates the Brønsted-Lowry definition. The reaction in choice $\mathrm{C}$ shows the ammonia (base) donating a pair of electrons to boron trifluoride (acid), which is indicative of the Lewis definition of an acid-base reaction. The final reaction in choice D shows the less popular Lux-Flood definition in which an $\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$ion is transferred from the base $(\mathrm{CaO})$ to the acid $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$.

39. The correct answer is C. The product shown is the result of a nucleophilic ring opening of an epoxide. Methyl iodide can be discounted because it does not represent a competent nucleophile. Sodium iodide does provide a good nucleophile (iodide), but it would not provide the product shown. The choice then becomes one of base-catalyzed or acid-catalyzed ring opening in methanol. Here the regiochemistry is the deciding factor. Note that the methoxy group ends up at the more substituted position; yet methoxide (Condition A) would attack at the least hindered (less substituted) position. However, under acidic conditions, the protonated epoxide already starts to open, elongating the bond between the oxygen and the more substituted carbon (i.e., more able to sustain positive character). The lone pair on the methanol is then attracted to the developing positive charge at that site, leading to the product shown.

Because the two substituents of the same priority are on opposite sides of the double bond, it is given the E(entgegen) designation.

41. The correct answer is $C$. Recall that ozonolysis is a type of oxidative cleavage that severs a double bond and, in the case of a reductive workup such as dimethyl sulfide, places a carbonyl at each terminus of the olefin:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_348ed3fba27176ba009dg-40.jpg?height=234&width=918&top_left_y=1040&top_left_x=716)

2-butanone

Because the total carbon count is the same, choices A and D can be excluded (six carbons and eight carbons, respectively). The decision between choice B and choice $\mathrm{C}$ is governed by regiochemistry (the hydroxyl group remains on the threecarbon fragment).

42. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The product of the oxidation is the corresponding ketone, as follows:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_348ed3fba27176ba009dg-40.jpg?height=111&width=678&top_left_y=1660&top_left_x=840)

The molecular weights of the two compounds are virtually identical; therefore, physical properties are governed primarily by differences in functional groups. Compared to ketones, alcohols can serve as both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and thus form more extensive $\mathrm{H}$-bond networks, resulting in higher boiling points (e.g., consider the extraordinarily high boiling point of water). For the same reason, an alcohol tends to bind more tightly to the polar silica gel in chromatography, resulting in lower $R_{f}$ values.

43. The correct answer is C. For the purposes of acidity, the starting material is best classified as a secondary alcohol. A suitable familiar model for such a substrate is 2-propanol (isopropanol), which has a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of about 17. 44. The correct answer is C. Aerobic respiration produces far more ATP than does anaerobic respiration. The process of anaerobic respiration produces 2 ATP (both from glycolysis), whereas aerobic respiration produces about 36 ATP from glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. The most accurate answer would be choice C.

45. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. If the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(proton) gradient were to be destroyed, the electron transport chain would be affected, as it is the only step of cellular respiration that relies on a concentration gradient. You must look for the choice that relates to how a cell performs cellular respiration without an electron transport chain. The only option is to move to anaerobic respiration, which requires fermentation, as indicated by choice A.

46. The correct answer is D. $S_{N} 2$ reactions take place with stronger nucleophiles, leaving groups on primary carbon atoms and at lower temperatures. A polar solvent favors the formation of ions, a characteristic not found in $S_{N} 2$ reactions.

47. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Ethanol has a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of about 16 and, as expected, acetic acid has a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of about $4.8$ as the lower $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ value. Terminal alkynes can give up their terminal hydrogen atoms in a base so as to react and extend the carbon chain when reacted with the proper alkyl halide. A terminal alkyne has a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ value of about 25 for its terminal hydrogen atoms. Alkanes are not very acidic at all and have a very high $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ value of about 50 .

48. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question relies on direct recollection of the steps of aerobic respiration. During the Krebs cycle, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is released as citric acid, broken down, and rearranged. There is no release of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in any other steps of aerobic respiration.

49. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The conditions leading to the formation of $N, N, 2,2-\quad$ Passage VIII tetramethylpropan-1-amine represent reductive amination, which occurs between amines and carbonyl compounds in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride. Because the amine component is given as dimethylamine, consideration of the remaining carbon fragment leads to the conclusion that Compound $\mathrm{A}$ is the aldehyde. The conditions leading to Compound $\mathrm{B}$ are evocative of the Grignard reaction, which proceeds by nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl.

52. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Examination of the amine product reveals a methylene group (i.e., two hydrogens) adjacent to the nitrogen. Only one of the hydrogens came from the hydride source (blue); the remaining hydrogen was already attached to the carbonyl carbon, meaning the starting material was an aldehyde.

Passage IX

53. The correct answer is D. Choice D shows all correct charges and coefficients for the equation. Five moles of calcium ions contribute $+10$. Three moles of phosphate ions contribute $-9$. One mole of hydroxide ions contributes $-1$. Adding them together results in a net of zero, signifying that the overall charge of the products is equal to the charge of the reactant.

54. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The direction will lie toward the species that is the stronger base. Because hydroxide is a stronger base than fluoride, the equilibrium will lie to the right.

55. The correct answer is B. A larger $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ means that the substance is more soluble and that more ions will be produced. Because the ions are the products, a larger $K_{\text {sp }}$ means that the products predominate.

56. The correct answer is B. A common ion lowers the solubility of the salt. An increase in calcium ion is an increase in the concentration of a product. The equilibrium will then shift to the left so as to consume this increase and make more reactant.

57. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Nine ions are formed when hydroxyapatite dissolves. Because the coefficient of each ion becomes the power of the concentration, you have $[x]^{5} \cdot[x]^{3} \cdot[x]^{1}=[x]^{9}$.

No Passage

58. The correct answer is $D$. Choice $D$ shows the correct Lewis structure for fluoride ion. A fluorine atom starts with seven valence electrons. Adding one more electron to complete the octet produces an ion with a $-1$ charge. 59. The correct answer is C. Ionic carbonates and hydrogen carbonates (also called bicarbonates) react with acids to form the unstable compound carbonic acid. Carbonic acid rapidly decomposes to carbon dioxide and water. The gas observed is carbon dioxide.

The reaction for carbonates is:

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}(a q)+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}(a q) \rightarrow " \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}(a q) " \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)+\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)
$$

The reaction for hydrogen carbonates is:

$$
\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}(a q)+\mathrm{H}^{+}(a q) \rightarrow " \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}(a q) " \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)+\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)

Answers and Explanations 

\section{Section 3. Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior}

1. The correct answer is B. According to frequency theory, pitch perception corre-

No Passage sponds to the frequency of vibration of the entire basilar membrane in the inner ear. According to place theory, pitch perception corresponds to the vibration of specific locations along the basilar membrane. Frequency theory cannot account for neurons firing over 1000 times per second, so it is associated only with lowerpitched sounds. The volley theory reconciles the two theories by showing that the neurons work together using the functions described in both place and frequency theories to signal pitch.

2. The correct answer is C. If a third tempo of $60 \mathrm{bpm}$ was introduced, it would be in between the slow tempo condition (43 bpm) and the fast tempo condition (75 bpm). According to Weber's law, a proportional difference in the initial/target and comparison tempos would be necessary for a person to detect a difference. Therefore, the magnitude (number of beats per minute) of the change would need to be greater than the slow tempo but less than the fast tempo.

3. The correct answer is $D$. If this study used a forced-choice signal detection method, responses could be classified into four categories: miss (failing to identify a changed stimulus), false alarm (identifying an unchanged stimulus as changed), correct rejection (identifying an unchanged comparison as the same as the initial/target stimulus), or hit (correctly identifying a comparison stimulus that differs from the initial/target stimulus). As the magnitude of the comparison tempo increased, the greater would be the likelihood that a participant would perceive a change and the greater the chance that he or she would identify the comparison tempo as different from the initial/target tempo.

4. The correct answer is A. According to Weber's law, the JND of a stimulus is in a constant proportion to the intensity/size of the initial/target stimulus. Therefore, the JND must be a constant proportion of the initial/target stimulus. Although the absolute threshold is a similar concept, that term refers to the minimum intensity/size necessary to perceive the existence of a stimulus and does not indicate the amount of change in an existing stimulus necessary to perceive a difference.

5. The correct answer is A. The faster the initial/target tempo, the greater the difference needed for detection between the initial and the comparison stimuli. The slower the initial/target tempo, the smaller the difference needed for detection between the initial and the comparison stimuli. The magnitude of the change necessary to perceive differences increases in proportion to the magnitude of the initial/target stimuli. The proportion of difference necessary is constant because the results were consistent with Weber's law. MCAT

Passage II 6. The correct answer is A. The occipital lobe is responsible for processing visual images. Further, research examining line orientation has found that specific neurons selectively fire in response to lines of different orientations. This is also consistent with feature integration theory (bottom-up processing).

7. The correct answer is D. Janet is displaying an understanding of conservation, whereas Tommy has yet to develop an understanding of conservation. Conservation is characterized by the ability to understand that the amount of a substance within a container remains the same even if the dimensions of the container change. Egocentrism is characterized by difficulty in sharing another person's viewpoint, a problem that is not necessarily represented in the question. Reversibility is not necessary for an understanding of conservation and is associated with a more complex understanding about state changes in objects and numbers. Object permanence is developed earlier, during the sensory motor stage.

8. The correct answer is A. The sensory motor stage is associated with the development of motor coordination and a memory of past events. During this stage, children master the concept of object permanence. Object permanence is characterized by the knowledge that an object continues to exist even when out of view of the child.

9. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Assimilation is characterized by the ability to absorb new ideas and experiences and to incorporate them into existing mental structures. Accommodation is the process of modifying previously developed mental structures and behaviors and adapting them to new experiences.

10. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The preoperational stage is characterized by the increased use of mental images and symbols. A key characteristic of the preoperational stage is egocentrism, in which the child is unable to see the world externally. To the child, the world does not exist by itself and only exists to satisfy the child's interests and needs.

No Passage 11. The correct answer is C. Positive psychology is a growing field that examines positive stress and emotions and how positive psychological processes keep humans mentally healthy and resilient.

Passage III 12. The correct answer is B. The Schachter-Singer theory of emotion posits that a stimulus triggers an autonomic arousal in the body (sympathetic nervous system), which causes a person to appraise the environmental context and, based on that appraisal, to interpret the emotion. This is the only theory that requires active appraisal of the environmental context, which is critical because the same autonomic experience in a different context may trigger a different emotion to be identified.

13. The correct answer is B. Japanese athletes described fewer self-focused emotions than American athletes. Additionally, Japanese athletes described more self+ other-focused emotions than American athletes. However, Japanese athletes described slightly more self-focused emotions than self+other-focused emotions.

14. The correct answer is A. The James-Lange theory posits that a stimulus creates autonomic arousal, causing the individual to identify an emotional state. The Cannon-Bard theory of emotion posits that a physiological arousal can occur without the emotion and that the stimulus simultaneously triggers autonomic arousal by the thalamus and the labeling of the emotion. The Schachter-Singer theory posits that stimuli trigger an autonomic arousal in the body, which causes the individual to appraise the environmental context in order to determine the emotional response.

15. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Conducting the experiment on additional groups from different cultures could yield more information about culture-specific differences in populations. A memory recall task and repeated measures of the same group would most likely not reveal any new information. Likewise, measuring arousal would not be very likely to result in new information.

16. The correct answer is B. Episodic memory is characterized as the ability to remember and consciously reexperience past events. Semantic memory is characterized by memory of facts.

17. The correct answer is D. Interference primarily occurs at the encoding stage of learning information. This is true, regardless of whether it is retroactive or proactive interference. In rare circumstances it can also interfere with retrieval.

18. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The Young-Helmholtz theory of color vision posits that color vision depends on three pigment receptors. Each of these receptors has different spectral sensitivities. Light of a particular wavelength activates the pigment receptors to different degrees, and the pattern of activity represents the perceived color. Ewald Hering proposed the opponent-process theory of color vision. This theory posits that color vision is caused by opposing responses generated by blue and yellow wavelengths and by red or green wavelengths (black and white are also sometimes added).

19. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The photo receptors will all respond to the wavelength of light. However, certain wavelengths will result in increased relative activation compared to others. This relative activation results in the perception of color.

20. The correct answer is B. The trichromatic (Young-Helmholtz) theory posits that receptors are stimulated within a range of wavelengths. So although they are preferentially stimulated by certain wavelengths, they respond to many. This is true for both rods and cones. Further, the combination of the three cone pigment receptors creates the perceived color.

21. The correct answer is D. A person lacking red- or green-sensitive cone pigment receptors would have red-green color blindness. The photoreceptors' stimulation Answers and Explanations No Passage

Passage IV MCAT

Practice Test 3 curves overlap substantially, and the lack of either can be classified as red-green color blindness.

22. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Wavelength stimulates the cone receptors. The combination of stimulation from the wave creates the perception of color. The perception of brightness results from the amplitude of the wave. The intensity of the stimulation increases, but the relative activation of the cone receptors stays relatively the same.

No Passage 23. The correct answer is A. The psychoanalytic theory is characterized by the interaction between the id (basic needs and wants), the ego (based on realistic expectations), and the superego (mediator of both the id and the ego).

Passage V 24. The correct answer is C. Accidents were more likely during the early morning. The data collected show two peaks. The first is in the early morning hours. The second, smaller peak is during the late afternoon. However, the early morning peak is the most substantial peak.

25. The correct answer is $B$. The accident peaks would drift to the right on the graph with a slightly longer circadian cycle. In the absence of circadian cues, sleep research has shown that the human circadian cycle has been shown to drift toward 25 hours rather than 24 . In this artificial case the main accident peak would continue to occur at the trough of the cycle and so would shift along with it.

26. The correct answer is D. Circadian timing is flexible but highly dependent on light, which will push the circadian cycle toward the daylight hours. Research suggests that exposure to light moves the circadian cycle toward the active daylight hours and is a cue that strongly influences behavior.

27. The correct answer is $D$. The suprachiasmatic nucleus located in the hypothalamus is the brain structure that seems to readjust the biological clock based on light exposure. Because some retinal pathways bypass the occipital lobe and project light information directly to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, it is possible for some individuals who are blind but still have this pathway intact to have normal circadian rhythms that respond to light.

No Passage 28. The correct answer is A. Individuals can experience an exacerbation of symptoms of existing medical conditions. Somatoform disorders are characterized by the experience of a medical condition that is exacerbated or alleviated by psychological conditions. They are often mistaken for factitious disorders, in which symptoms are intentionally created, or malingering, in which symptoms are reported but not experienced by the individual. True somatoform disorders are not intentional. Pain has multiple psychosocial factors that affect the pain experience, and all pain has a psychosomatic component to it.

Passage VI 29. The correct answer is A. The majority of participants (65\%) obeyed the authority figure to the point that they administered what they believed were lethal shocks. 30. The correct answer is A. The participant teacher would typically obey the authority figure despite discomfort or pain exhibited by the learner. Most participants continued to administer shocks at the insistence of the authority figure until the shocks appeared to be potentially lethal.

31. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The group discussion makes ethics more salient to the participant teachers, and the influence of the group is likely to polarize the individual toward increasing the importance of ethics through groupthink phenomena.

32. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. In social psychology research, obedience represents compliance to direct commands from an authority figure.

33. The correct answer is C. For such a small amount of money, Jack could not justify that he was doing the dishes for the money; therefore, cognitive dissonance theory indicates he will change his attitude about the chore. Cognitive dissonance results when there is a disconnect between an individual's actions and beliefs. When these are at odds, the individual will often change his or her attitudes or beliefs to bring them into line with his or her actions.

34. The correct answer is C. The unconditioned stimulus would be paired with the conditioned stimulus in initial trials on day 1 . The unconditioned stimulus is paired with the conditioned stimulus during learning trials. In the graph, the saliva is shown to increase only during trials in which the pairing is present (day 1 ; trials 2-16). The increase between days is typical of spontaneous recovery.

35. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The conditioned stimulus would be present on trials over the course of all three days. The conditioned stimulus would be paired with the unconditioned stimulus on initial trials on day 1 (during pairing/learning). It would also be present during the extinction and spontaneous recovery trials on the remaining day 1 trials, as well as the trials over the next two days.

36. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Only the food elicits a response prior to conditioning. The food is the unconditioned stimulus and will elicit the saliva response without any conditioning. During trials, the bell is paired with the food and will elicit the conditioned response by itself in absence of the unconditioned stimulus. However, the response to the conditioned stimulus will drop over time without any new unconditioned stimulus-conditioned stimulus pairings.

37. The correct answer is A. The increase is consistent with the concept of spontaneous recovery. This phenomenon has been noted in certain classical conditioning paradigms. It is characterized by the reappearance of an extinguished response after a period of nonexposure to the conditioned stimulus.

38. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. During the industry versus inferiority stage, an individual must successfully integrate into larger social networks and become competent in academics. Once this conflict is resolved, the individual then progresses to the identity versus role confusion stage. Answers and Explanations No Passage

Practice Test 3

Passage VIII 39. The correct answer is $C$. The infant monkeys preferred to spend more time with the cloth surrogate, regardless of whether they took food from the cloth surrogate or the wire surrogate. The data indicates that monkeys fed by either surrogate (cloth or wire) spent more time with the cloth surrogate.

40. The correct answer is B. Infant monkeys prefer the cloth surrogate because they were more attached to the emotional comfort that the cloth provides. The data shows that regardless of which surrogate fed the infant monkeys, they preferred spending time with the more comforting cloth surrogate.

41. The correct answer is A. The infant monkeys would seek comfort from the cloth surrogate, regardless of which surrogate they took food from. The monkeys would seek comfort from the cloth surrogate because they had become emotionally attached to the cloth surrogate. They would prefer the surrogate with which they had formed an attachment if presented with a stimulus-eliciting fear.

42. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This potential design would allow you to see whether attachment could be formed to the wire surrogate if given the right conditions. Using adult monkeys would not help you learn more about attachment in infant monkeys. Feeding monkeys from both surrogate types at the same time would most likely not result in any differences, because the infant monkeys already have shown their preference for the comforting (cloth) surrogate over the wire surrogate.

No Passage 43. The correct answer is B. Low self-esteem results from low self-efficacy and an external locus of control. Low self-efficacy beliefs such as feeling that you cannot succeed and an external locus of control such as feeling that events are outside of your control are associated with low self-esteem.

Passage IX 44. The correct answer is C. Based on the data shown in the second figure, students were more likely to judge their own team's correct scores as resulting from study and preparation and their opponents' correct scores as resulting from test question bias.

45. The correct answer is A. Participants in the survey believed that correct scores for their team were the result of study and preparation (internal factor) and that correct scores for the other team were the result of test question bias.

46. The correct answer is A. Students would say that their own team picked wrong answers due to test question bias, but their opponents picked wrong answers due to lack of study and preparation. This is consistent with attribution theory, which posits that one's own personal successes are attributed to internal characteristics, but others' successes are due to external factors. Conversely, one's own failures (wrong answers) are attributed to external factors (test question bias), whereas others' failures are attributed to internal factors (lack of study and preparation). 47. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute personal successes to personal traits/characteristics and personal failures to external causes. This answer is consistent with self-serving bias.

48. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Both mental health hospitals and prisons are institutions.

49. The correct answer is C. Within each group of three vertical bars, the bar on the left represents the percentage of the U.S. population that identifies as that racial/ethnic group, and the bar in the middle represents the percentage of bachelor's degrees earned by that racial or ethnic group. The bar in the middle is higher than the bar on the left only for the Asian and white populations.

50. The correct answer is D. In the graph, the third vertical bar in each group represents the percentage of women earning more bachelor's degrees than men within that racial or ethnic group. In every case, the presence of the bar indicates that women earn more than 50 percent of the bachelor's degrees. If the women in a group were earning fewer bachelor's degrees than men, there would be no vertical bar in that position.

51. The correct answer is C. Although choices A, B, and D may be true, interest levels, financial aid, or career choice cannot be extrapolated from this graph. The only conclusion is that women are more successful than men at completing bachelor's degrees.

52. The correct answer is A. Research suggests that a woman's ascribed status (mother, wife) may have a greater influence on her overall status in U.S. society than her personal and educational accomplishments. Women's ascribed statuses may also have greater role demands than men's (e.g., for a woman in the United States, being a "parent" and "wife" usually still requires assuming more than 50 percent of child care and household responsibilities, as compared to a man's role demands as a "parent" and "husband").

53. The correct answer is C. Intelligence does not differ among SES groups. However, opportunities that allow a person to take advantage of his or her intelligence are rarer among lower SES groups. Individuals who hold a just world theory commonly use blame-the-victim techniques (e.g., claiming that someone is in poverty because he or she deserves it) to explain why they do not experience a negative event (e.g., "I am not in poverty because I work harder"). Social reinforcement is a better explanation of decreased social mobility among established societies. Lower SES individuals encounter greater environmental health risks, fewer economic opportunities, and fewer educational opportunities, all of which maintain the status quo SES. Research has shown that lower and higher SES individuals do not differ in their ability to make good choices about their opportunities. However, individuals from lower SES have fewer opportunities, and any poor decisions that they make have a greater impact on their SES trajectory. Answers and Explanations

No Passage

Passage X

No Passage MCAT

Practice Test 3 54. The correct answer is A. Sandra moved from lower SES to middle SES due to an improvement of her educational opportunities and an increase in her human capital. She avoided the social reproduction of maintaining her parents' lower SES. Social stratification does exist in this scenario, but the scenario shows movement across social strata, so social mobility is a better answer. Nepotism does not apply because Sandra's family members were not in a position to provide her with a higher-paying position upon graduation.

55. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. Functionalist theory supports societal stratification as a way to reward the best-qualified individuals and lure them into the positions that are the most critical to the functioning of that society.

Passage XI 56. The correct answer is D. The graph can tell you only the relationship between distance from the airport and nighttime activity. You have to make the cognitive leap that nighttime movements can be a distal measure of sleep coherency. There is a likely association, but because actigraphy is not the most proximal measure of sleep coherency, you cannot make a definitive statement.

57. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Negative amenities tend to decrease housing costs in the affected area, which means that individuals with lower financial resources can afford to live in that area. It is important to note that individuals will report that they "adapt" to noisy environments, but in reality psychology studies show that they continue to have the same level of physiological activation in response to noise disruption and there is no physiological adaptation.

58. The correct answer is A. Because actigraphy is a good measure of movement, but is only a distal measure of sleep coherency, the logical next step would be to make sure that sleep coherency is really affected by airport noise using the more proximal measure of direct EEG measurements of sleep.

59. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. All of the other answers are known outcomes from living near negative amenities with high levels of noise pollution, but improved productivity is not. Individuals living near airports are more likely to experience disrupted sleep leading to increased illness (due to inefficient immune systems), poorer grades (due to difficulty concentrating and sleep deprivation), and more car accidents (for the same reason as poorer grades). 

\section{Section 4. Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills}

1. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question has to do with interpreting vocabulary. Your Explanations first step in answering it is to scan the passage to find the word elusive. It appears in paragraph 2, in the context of qualities of happiness. It is not used in a negative connotation, as choices A and B (both synonyms for lying) would indicate. Choice C doesn't work with the other quality of happiness, which is mysterious. Something that is frank, or honest and forthright, cannot also be mysterious. Choice D is therefore the best answer.

2. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. You need to assess evidence for this question. Because authors ideally use examples to support their statements, you need to find the information that explains why Watson's study was thought to be startling. By scanning paragraph 2 for the exact reference, you will find that the second sentence contains the answer: "Because happiness was considered a highly desired yet elusive and mysterious emotion, Watson's serious endeavor was startling.” This is a clear giveaway that choice $\mathrm{C}$ is correct.

3. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question asks you to locate details within the passage. If one statement stands out as false, you can eliminate all other answer choices. But often, it is easier to answer this type of question by eliminating the true statements. The last two sentences of paragraph 3 contain the information in choice A, so you can eliminate it. Paragraph 5 corresponds with choice C, and paragraph 4 corresponds with choice D. Choice B is the correct answer because the passage states that "findings show the mind-body connection cannot be denied," not that science is attempting to prove the connection.

4. The correct answer is A. You are asked to identify cause and effect as it is implied in the passage for this question. Note that the example of a subject repeating the phrase, "I am successful" does not appear in the passage. However, the last paragraph notes that repetition of a positive affirmation can lead to an increase in left cerebral cortex activity and increased feelings of happiness and well-being. "I am successful" is such an affirmation, and you could expect choice A, a feeling of well-being, to be the outcome following its repetition.

5. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question looks at cause and effect, not as directly Passage II presented in the essay, but rather as implied by the essay. Whittier and Holmes are mentioned once as contemporaries of Longfellow who also employed similar themes and rhymes. Because Longfellow's reputation is said to suffer because of these very themes and rhymes, it may be implied that the reputations of Whittier and Holmes suffer a similar fate. There is no evidence in the passage to support choice A, so it should be eliminated. Choice B is too negative; neither Longfellow nor Whittier and Holmes are said to be held in contempt or disdain. Choice D is in opposition to the ideas found in the passage. Modern poetry is influenced MCAT

Practice Test 3 by Whitman, not Longfellow, Whittier, and Holmes. Choice C works best, with "antiquated" echoing paragraph l's "quaint and primly Victorian."

6. The correct answer is B. You are asked to find the main idea in this question. This type of question is passage based, meaning you should focus on what is actually said as opposed to what may be implied or suggested. To answer it, ask "What is the author trying to say?" Typically, at least one answer choice is not found within the passage. In this case, choices $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ can be easily eliminated for that reason-neither is stated. Another type of distracter is an answer choice that is too narrow to be the main idea of the passage. Choice A is a good example; the passage encompasses much more than a simple comparison of free verse as opposed to rhymes. You are left with choice B, which is the correct answer.

7. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. This question asks you to assess evidence. To answer it, first note the hypothesis as stated in the question stem: Whitman was responsible for the radical shift in American poetry. Then determine which statements support it and which one does not. The one that does not is the correct answer. The fact that his poetry was personal and intimate (choice B) supports the hypothesis, as does his use of free verse (choice D). Choice C, choosing as his subjects the common man and commonplace events, also supports the hypothesis. Nowhere in the passage does it state that Whitman used iconic American figures as his subjects; in fact, that is what Longfellow did, and his poetry was what Whitman's shifted away from. That means choice A is correct.

8. The correct answer is $D$. To answer this question, you need to interpret vocabulary. Find the phrase in the passage and examine it in context. The sentence in paragraph 1 in which it is found reads, "Why do his contemporaries continue to be enjoyed and studied while Longfellow languishes in the tomb of cultural artifacts?" There is a dichotomy set up between continuing to be enjoyed and studied and languishing in the tomb of cultural artifacts. Being in "the tomb of cultural artifacts" is therefore the opposite of being enjoyed and studied. Only one answer choice relates to the idea of this dichotomy; if Longfellow's work is "considered to be dead," it is surely not being enjoyed and studied. Choice D is the best answer.

9. The correct answer is B. In this question, you are drawing conclusions about the author's intent, choosing the best or most likely answer. Sales figures for Longfellow's poems about iconic American figures are cited as facts and not implied to be an apparent belief of the author, making choice A incorrect. Although Emerson is revealed to be an influence on Whitman, there is nothing in the passage to suggest that he could be considered by the author to be the Father of American Poetry (in fact, he is not mentioned as being a poet), making choice $\mathrm{C}$ incorrect. The passage clearly delineates the vast differences between the work of Longfellow and confessional poetry; therefore, choice D must also be wrong. The terms the author uses to describe Whitman and his work in the last paragraph ("groundbreaking," "legacy") enforce his view that Whitman's poetry is more popular than Longfellow's (that resides in a "tomb").

10. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question asks you to apply new evidence to an existing argument. The new evidence is an ambivalent statement by Ezra Pound, in which he both declares his distaste for much of Whitman's work while still admiring it enough to imitate it. The author declares that Pound celebrated his debt to Whitman, which is neither repudiated nor endorsed (choices A and B) by Pound's ambivalence. Similarly, the second part of the statement (regarding imitation) does not deny the author's contention. Choice D is the correct answer because it identifies the passage's use of celebrate as too positive a word in light of Pound's "pain" in reading Whitman.

11. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This kind of question asks you to choose an accurate summary. The sales figures are cited to back up the author's assertion that Longfellow's poems were "incredibly popular" (choice D). Choice C is a tricky diversion; although the author does note that sales figures for The Song of Hiawatha were "astounding for the time," he does not state or infer that those numbers marked a milestone.

12. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question asks you to interpret vocabulary. In the context of the passage, the word province is used to indicate something that belongs only to humans and to no other living creatures. The answer choice closest in meaning to this is choice D, "domain." Choices A and B are part of the definition of the word province, but they are not how the word is used in this context. The passage states that some believe rights are appropriate only for humans, but says nothing about responsibility, as choice $\mathrm{C}$ says.

13. The correct answer is D. For this question, you'll have to use the information in the passage to make predictions. Based on the information in the passage, you need to predict which of the rights in the answer choices a utilitarian would not believe an animal has. The fifth paragraph states that a utilitarian would believe that animals had a right to be free from unnecessary pain and suffering, but that they may not have rights that they don't have the capacity to possess. Choices A, $\mathrm{B}$, and $\mathrm{C}$ all indicate actions that would cause the animal pain or suffering. But an animal does not have the right to possess anything, because property is a human concept. This makes choice $\mathrm{D}$ the best answer.

14. The correct answer is A. You'll have to draw conclusions to answer this question. Look back at the passage to find what Bentham and Sidgwick believe. Bentham states that the interests and desires of the members of a system are all equal; Sidgwick states that the Universe treats all goods as equal. Thus choice A is the best answer. Choice B is unsupported because although the passage states that Bentham believes animals should have equal consideration, it is not clear that Answers and Explanations Passage III MCAT

Practice Test 3 Sidgwick believes that. The passage states that Bentham is unconcerned with the issue of whether animals can reason, so his view on it is unknown, as is Sidgwick's, which eliminates choice C. And it is not clear what Sidgwick believes about whether animals have the capacity to suffer (choice D).

15. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question asks you to analyze an argument. Remember that everything an author includes in a passage is there for a reason. What role do the parenthetical inserts play in the development of the author's thesis? The discussion of Bentham indicates that Bentham is focusing not on issues of reason or speech-which are unimportant-but on the capacity to suffer, which is the key point. Choice B reflects this sentiment. There is no evidence to support choice A. The views discussed are Bentham's, not those of animal rights supporters (choice C). And the inserts serve to emphasize the important point of Bentham's argument, not to head off possible objections as in choice D.

16. The correct answer is D. Again, you'll have to make predictions to answer this question. Use the information the passage provides on utilitarianism to predict which situation could not be justified. Choice A is okay because the passage states that as long as the sum total of happiness increases, the action is okay. Thus in certain circumstances it may be necessary to use an individual in such a way that benefits many others. Choice B can be justified because the death penalty may increase the overall good by ridding the world of a dangerous person. Similarly, torture (choice C) may be justified if it saves the lives of other people. However, indiscriminate killing is not acceptable to a utilitarian. The killing would have to be directed to somehow increasing the good of other people.

17. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This question asks you to find the main idea. The passage states that there is a debate about the validity of animal rights and utilitarianism and provides a framework from which both advocates and opponents of animal rights may view the situation. This is what choice A states. The passage does show how to justify animal rights, as choice B states, but it also shows how to justify not having animal rights. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is wrong because the passage presents arguments for both positions. And choice D is wrong because although Bentham's and Sidgwick's views are mentioned, their ideas form only one part of the larger debate.

Passage IV 18. The correct answer is A. You are asked to interpret vocabulary for this question. The sentence states that the bohemian culture rejected limits placed on the society. A cultured person recognizes the standards agreed on by society for certain behaviors, and so a bohemian would reject them. Although the word polite could be used to mean the words in choices $\mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}$, and $\mathrm{D}$, this is not how the word is used in this context.

19. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The question asks you to make generalizations. In general, the bohemian is against limits placed on the individual by society. Current fashion trends represent one way a society may limit an individual by dictating what sort of dress is acceptable. The prevailing mores of a society are the values that the society at large deems appropriate. Capitalism is also a product of the society, and a bohemian would reject thinking in the same way as the rest of the people. Thus all three statements are appropriate, and choice $\mathrm{D}$ is the best answer.

20. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. For this question, you must draw conclusions. The author does not directly state choice C, but implies it by saying that the Education Act led to a literate, although not necessarily educated, public. This part of the passage also makes choice A incorrect. Choice B is not supported, because the act dealt only with elementary education. Choice D cannot be inferred. It is true that the author believes the act furthered the gulf between artist and public, but it is not clear whether artists were angry about it.

21. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This is a fairly straightforward question asking about supporting details. The answer is found at the end of paragraph 2, where the author states that the degree to which the audiences were fragmented occurred at an unprecedented rate. This supports choice B. There is no support for the other choices in the passage.

22. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This is another question asking you to draw conclusions. The author states that the late Victorian period was marked by pessimism and stoicism and that the authors mentioned all demonstrated such sentiments. Thus it can be concluded that they were influenced by the trends of their time. It is not clear whether they were popular or esteemed, as choices A and C indicate. Nor does the passage state what audience they wrote for, which means choice D is not supported.

23. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This is a question that asks you to modify conclusions. The author contends that after the Georgian period, the old European order was no more. However, if the literature returned to its old Victorian ways, as choice A indicates, the author's conclusion would be incorrect. The developments in America detailed in choice B would be irrelevant to the author's argument. If the artists reintegrated into society as in choice $\mathrm{C}$, it would indicate a change in the prevailing system, not a return to old ways. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ also is immaterial to the argument.

24. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question asks you to find the main idea. This passage Passage $\mathrm{V}$ explains that theoretically, a massive amount of computational power is available. However, practical considerations make it unlikely that this limit would ever be reached. Thus choice $\mathrm{C}$ is the best answer. Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is a detail provided in the passage, but it is not the main idea. Choice $\mathrm{B}$ is incorrect, because the advances discussed are still primarily theoretical. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is also only partly correct, because it doesn't deal with the practical limits mentioned in the passage.

25. The correct answer is A. This question asks you to analyze an argument. The author mentions thermonuclear explosions in the same sentence in which it is Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 3 stated that the discussion of computing power is purely theoretical. Choice A best reflects this. No other answer choice is supported by the information in the passage.

26. The correct answer is A. You are asked to draw a conclusion in order to answer this question. The author indicates that choices $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ are still in the realm of the theoretical. The author also states that the memory limit in choice $\mathrm{C}$ may be "exceeded." That leaves choice A, which is supported when the author states that the calculation of the computer's power is based on "the most conservative estimates" of human computational power. Thus the proposed computers can be even more powerful than the author describes.

27. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question asks about supporting details and evidence. Go back to the passage and find why the author believes technology may reach the theoretical limit discussed. In the last paragraph, the author indicates that each technological advance provides the basis for further evolution, as choice B states. Choice A refers to the author's discussion of memory capacity, not computational power, and indicates a way technicians may exceed the theoretical limits described. Choice $C$ has nothing to do with reaching the theoretical limits of computational power. The technology to reach the limits does not yet exist, as choice D seems to indicate.

28. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question requires you to combine information. The passage discusses computers, technology, and even physics. However, the information is presented at the level of someone with a casual, rather than expert, knowledge of these fields. Thus choice D would be the best answer. Choice A may be close, but the information in the passage is not written at the level of expertise that a reader would expect in an academic journal.

29. The correct answer is C. The question asks you to solve a problem. To answer it, you must first understand how computational power is calculated. The passage states that the power is found by dividing the total energy by the energy required for an operation. Decreasing the amount of energy, as in choice $\mathrm{C}$, would yield a larger quotient. Choice A would do the opposite, and choices B and D would decrease the total energy available.

30. The correct answer is A. This question asks you to draw a conclusion. Based on the information in the passage, choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best choice. The passage indicates that thus far, researchers have only been able to store information on a few atoms. Choice B is practically the opposite of what the passage states, whereas the information in choice $\mathrm{C}$ is suggested by the author as a way to exceed the theoretical memory limit. The work at the University of Oklahoma relates to memory capacity, not computing power, as choice D indicates.

Passage VI 31. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question asks you to find the main idea. This passage discusses the basic structure of language and specifically a feature of the English language, namely its paucity of verb forms. Choice $C$ is the best summary of the passage. Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is not the main idea of the passage at all. Choice $\mathrm{B}$ is too strong. It is not stated that each and every language is unique. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is wrong because the passage states the English language is able to convey a number of meanings even though its verb forms are limited.

32. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This application question asks you to draw conclusions. The author states that the English language makes do with fewer verb forms than other languages, but it still can convey different meanings. This makes choice A correct. Choices B and D are not supported by the passage, and choice C reflects what some linguists believe.

33. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question involves analyzing an argument. Statement $\mathrm{I}$ is supported by the examples of the Spanish language and the Kivunjo language, which have far more forms than the English language. Statement II is unsupported by a specific example. Statement III is supported by the example in the final paragraph of the different meanings of similar-sounding verb forms, which makes choice $\mathrm{C}$ the best answer.

34. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. In order to answer this question, you'll need to combine information. The passage provides interesting information on language and specifically on the English language. However, it is not directed at linguists (choice A), who presumably would already know much of the information. A language teacher (choice B) would most likely find the information interesting background to a language lesson. It is not clear what psychologists would find interesting in the passage. Translators may find the information interesting, but nothing in the passage pertains specifically to translation, so choice B is a better answer.

35. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question tests your ability to make predictions. Based on the information in the passage, you need to predict which sentence may strike a Spanish speaker as odd. The passage states that in Spanish, the stem of the verb is not a word. In English, one use of the stem of the verb is in the infinitive form, as used in choice B, "to see." The past tense (choice A), the third-person singular (choice C), and the gerund form (choice D) all involve changing the stem, which is similar to the Spanish language.

36. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question asks about supporting details. The passage states that the present tense (statement I) is usually expressed using the stem form of the verb, but can also be expressed in the third-person singular by using the $-s$ suffix. Similarly, verbal adjectives (statement II) are sometimes expressed using the -ing suffix and sometimes with the -ed suffix.

37. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question requires you to draw conclusions. From the information in the passage, what can be concluded about the Russian language? Its lack of pronounceable stems for its verbs makes it similar to Spanish and different Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 3 from English. Furthermore, the passage states that English is unlike many IndoEuropean languages in its use of the stem form as a word. From this information, a linguist may conclude that Russian might (but not necessarily) be part of the Indo-European family. Just because the stem forms are not pronounced gives no information on the number of forms, as choice A states. Choice $C$ is not a valid inference based on the information in the passage. The lack of pronounced stem verbs says nothing about the number of inflections, which are the ways a word changes when taking on different roles in the sentence.

Passage VII 38. The correct answer is D.You are asked to find the main idea of the last paragraph. In the last paragraph, the author states that Smith "had inspired many of the changes for which his rival is now known." His rival was Roosevelt, and the implication is that Roosevelt took credit for many ideas that began with Smith. There is no indication that Roosevelt would have done better on a ticket with Smith (choice A), and Smith's background is not a topic of this paragraph (choice C). Contrary to choice B, many of Smith's ideals were those that formed the foundation of the New Deal.

39. The correct answer is $B$. Although choice A may be true, only choice B is alluded to in the passage, allowing you to draw conclusions. New York City, says the author, was "viewed even in the early twentieth century as disconnected from the national character."

40. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Without knowing more about the two rivals, any one of these answers might be possible, but the only one that is supported by the text is choice D. Roosevelt's ambition led to political maneuvering that shut Smith out of the nomination. This is a cause-and-effect question.

41. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The discussion of nativism shows that Smith was not a credible candidate to many because of his Catholic immigrant background. It has nothing to do with his eligibility (choice A); it has to do with the bigotry of the electorate. This is an example of interpreting vocabulary.

42. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Either choice A or choice B might be true, but neither is supported by a cause-and-effect relationship presented in the text. Davis was chosen as a "compromise candidate" when the delegates failed to choose between Smith and McAdoo.

43. The correct answer is B. The author presents supporting details about Smith's many successes in the state of New York, from his work as Speaker of the Assembly to his many years as governor. Choice A does not support the claim that he was successful, and choice $C$ actually belies the claim. The list of names mentioned in choice D does not exist in the passage.

44. The correct answer is A. Smith was a progressive born of immigrant parents, and he supported both civil liberties and unions, as well as "those he saw as most in need of government's assistance." Of the answers given, only choice A is likely. This question requires you to combine information.

45. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This is a comprehension question on finding the main idea. This kind of question does not require you to go beyond the boundaries of the passage. You should think, "What is the author trying to say?" In fact, the author never says choice A at all. Although the point is made that megacities are more often found in less developed nations, the second half of that statement does not appear in the passage. Nor does the author discuss decimation of the countryside and limitations in our ability to grow food, as choice $\mathrm{C}$ would indicate. And although you might infer choice D, the author never makes any such assertion. The best answer, the one that best conforms simply to the words on the page, is choice B.

46. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This comprehension question has to do with supporting details and evidence. You can answer it easily if you scan the passage for the word demographer and then see what information is directly presented. In paragraph 1 , demographers "are referring to the 21st century as 'the urban century."' In paragraph 6, "demographers foresee ecological overload, homelessness, uncontrolled traffic, infrastructure strained to the breaking point." Based on your quick scan of the passage, there is no evidence to support choices A, B, or D. The answer is clearly choice C.

47. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This evaluation question requires you to analyze an argument. Questions like this ask you to explain why an author included certain information. Scan the essay to locate the reference to UN statistics, and you see that those statistics tell us "by the year 2030, more than 60 percent of the world population will be urban, up from 30 percent in 1950." In other words, there has been a dramatic change in the look of the world, thanks to urbanization. This correlates to choice A. It does not contradict demographers' claims (choice B), nor does it say anything about poverty, crime, or birth rate (choices $\mathrm{C}$ and D). Notice that this kind of question asks you to think "outside" the passage a bit more than comprehension questions 45 and 46 did.

48. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This application question looks at cause and effect, not as directly presented in the essay, but rather as implied by the essay. In fact, you may have been alarmed to see that the word skyscraper never appears in the passage at all, so scanning the passage does not help. Remember that questions get harder within a question set. This question, the fourth one in the set, is harder than the first three. The clue to the answer is in the last line of the essay. "Megacities," the author claims," are creating anew even deeper division between rich and poor, as the poor concentrate in the outskirts of town and the rich barricade themselves behind walls and in towers." Those "towers" are the high-rise apartment buildings Answers and Explanations

Passage VIII MCAT

Practice Test 3 in which the rich dwell, whereas the poor live in shanties on the cities' outskirts. The only answer supported by the text is choice $C$.

49. The correct answer is D. This incorporation of information question asks you to apply new evidence to an existing argument. This kind of question takes you furthest from the passage itself in an effort to get you to recognize its real-world applications. You might begin by scanning to locate the part of the passage that deals with the contention mentioned: that cities will continue to grow despite a slowing of migration from the countryside. It appears in paragraph 5 , and its causative link is the notion that "the birth rate in less-developed nations is high." If you take away this cause, as choice D would do, then the author's supposition that cities will continue to grow has no foundation. None of the other answer choices would collapse the argument as well.

50. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This comprehension question has to do with interpreting vocabulary. The first thing to do is to scan the passage and search for the word radicalism. It appears in paragraph 4 , in the context of qualities that informed Rivera's artwork. It is not used in a negative connotation, as choices B and C would indicate. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is almost right, but again, it has a more negative connotation than the passage implies. Therefore, choice A is the best answer.

51. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This evaluation question asks you to analyze an argument. Authors rarely include information without a reason, and the MCAT often asks you to identify and assess the reasons behind the inclusion of a passage or phrase. Here, Orozco's art is discussed in its relation to politics, from his Holy Trinity of workers to his political cartoons. Although choice B might be correct in a different context, choice $\mathrm{C}$ is the better answer.

52. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This evaluation question requires you to assess evidence. Ideally, a writer does not include a statement without adequate support. Here, the statement is that Siqueiros might approve of Chicano graffiti. If you scan to find the exact reference in paragraph 5, you see that the author states, "It began as outlaw art, which surely would have appealed to an outlaw such as Siqueiros." That is a clear giveaway that choice $\mathrm{D}$ is the best response; Chicano art was outlaw art, and Siqueiros was considered by many to be an outlaw, or gangster.

53. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This application question calls for making generalizations about a topic-in this case, graffiti. To do this correctly, you must put together the author's statements about the topic and draw a conclusion from the information you are given. Paragraphs on graffiti appear at the end of the passage. Although the author refers to it as "outlaw art" and mentions that some people considered it a nuisance, that is clearly not the author's own impression. Phrases such as "managed to create something beautiful while making political statements about poverty, injustice, diversity, and racism" and "public art ... that . . is truly for everyone" put a positive spin on the topic. The author does not believe that graffiti is a "pale imitation" (choice B); instead, she indicates that the graffiti artists are following in the muralists' tradition. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ appears as a description of Rivera's work and is not relevant to this discussion of graffiti. That makes choice A the most logical answer. Answers and Explanations
