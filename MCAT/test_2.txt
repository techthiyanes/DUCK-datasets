Questions 1-6 are based on the following passage.

Passage I

Maintenance of proper $\mathrm{pH}$ throughout the body is critical to homeostasis and is carried out through the collective efforts of multiple systems in the body. Failure of the kidneys or respiratory system can have drastic consequences on the body's ability to regulate blood $\mathrm{pH}$. In order to regulate $\mathrm{pH}$ in the blood, a buffering system is used, which is shown. This reaction is completely reversible and is driven in either direction depending on the concentration of the reactants. A change to one item in this reaction will in turn affect the concentration of all of the other items. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase:

Generally, there are not many problems with the body's ability to have plenty of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ ions in reserve. However, if $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ion levels should become too low, the kidneys can generate more. In the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of the nephrons, carbonic anhydrase converts $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which dissociates into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Kidney failure or damage to the carbonic anhydrase enzyme can cause major problems in the ability to regulate blood $\mathrm{pH}$.

When the kidneys fail, their functions must be mimicked or death will occur. Dialysis is used as a means to perform some of the normal functions of the kidneys, which includes the maintenance of acid-base balance. During dialysis, the patient's blood is exposed to dialysis fluid. The dialysis fluid has been prepared such that it will perPractice Test 2 form a variety of functions that include balancing blood $\mathrm{pH}$, removing wastes from the blood, and removing excess fluids. While dialysis treatment is not nearly as efficient as natural kidney function, it can be used for extended periods of time in many patients with satisfactory results.

1. Based on the buffering equation shown in the passage, if $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ion concentration increased, which of the following would occur?

A. The concentration of carbonic acid would increase.

B. The concentration of carbon dioxide would decrease.

C. Bicarbonate ion concentration would increase.

D. Carbonic anhydrase activity would be reduced.

2. Increased levels of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ in the plasma should cause:
A. a decrease in ventilation rate
B. an increase in ventilation rate
C. an increase in plasma $\mathrm{pH}$
D. a decrease in the osmotic concentration of urine

3. Suppose plasma levels of carbon dioxide were elevated. On a cellular level, where does this carbon dioxide come from?
A. It is produced during protein synthesis.
B. It is a by-product of nucleic acid metabolism.
C. It is a by-product of glucose metabolism.
D. It is produced as a direct conversion from oxygen gas in the cells.

4. Many dialysis patients do not produce any urine, so dialysis must be used to manage their fluid levels. In order to remove excess fluids from the blood during dialysis, the patient's blood must be:
A. isotonic as compared to the dialysis solution
B. hypertonic as compared to the dialysis solution
C. hypotonic as compared to the dialysis solution
D. the same $\mathrm{pH}$ as the dialysis solution

5. A class of drugs known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is known to increase the excretion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions via urine while allowing for the retention of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions. This should cause:
A. an increase in urine volume due to osmotic effects
B. a decrease in urine volume due to increased water reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule
C. a decrease in urine $\mathrm{pH}$ due to the excretion of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions
D. no changes to the normal properties of urine since $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions are normally secreted in the urine 6. One of the goals of dialysis is to remove several small, toxic solutes from the blood. In order for the toxins to move from the blood into the dialysis solution, which of the following processes must occur?
A. active transport
B. diffusion
C. osmosis
D. facilitated diffusion

Questions 7-12 are based on the following passage.

Passage II

Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of benign tumors in the brain and on other organs of the body, including the heart, lungs, skin, and kidneys. The prevalence of the condition is about 1 in every 6000 newborns. The symptoms of the disease are variable in their severity, which may take years to fully develop and are often misdiagnosed. One common symptom seen in many tuberous sclerosis patients is kidney problems such as cysts. While the cysts typically cause no major problems, occasionally the cysts may bleed, which causes blood loss and anemia and may lead to kidney failure.

The disease is caused by mutations in two genes, tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (TSC1 and TSC2), although only one gene needs to be affected to have the disease. The TSC1 gene produces a protein called hamartin, while the TSC2 gene produces the protein tuberin. Both hamartin and tuberin act as tumor suppressors in the body. A typical pedigree for tuberous sclerosis is shown with affected individuals being shaded:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_6cd4336cff91b16b536cg-03.jpg?height=287&width=1065&top_left_y=1545&top_left_x=411)

While most cases of tuberous sclerosis are acquired according to the pattern shown in the pedigree, some individuals acquire tuberous sclerosis through a process called gonadal mosaicism. In these cases, the parents do not have apparent mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 in their somatic cells, but they have passed the mutation to their children.

The prognosis for individuals with tuberous sclerosis depends on the severity of their symptoms. Some common symptoms are learning disabilities, seizures, mental SECTION 1:

Biological and

Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems retardation, skin abnormalities, and kidney failure. Most individuals with tuberous

Practice Test 2 sclerosis live to a normal life expectancy.

7. Based on the pedigree provided, what is the MOST likely pattern of inheritance for tuberous sclerosis?
A. sex-linked recessive
B. sex-linked dominant
C. autosomal recessive
D. autosomal dominant

8. If an individual overexpressed both TSC1 and TSC2, you would expect that:
A. The individual would be likely to develop a severe case of tuberous sclerosis.
B. The individual should develop a mild case of tuberous sclerosis.
C. The individual would produce excess hamartin and tuberin to protect against tumor formation.
D. The individual would produce minimal amounts of hamartin and tuberin, which would allow for some protection against tumor formation.

9. In order for gonadal mosaicism to be the cause of tuberous sclerosis, a mutation must have occurred in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene during:
A. mitosis in embryonic development
B. meiosis in embryonic development
C. mitosis of brain and skin cells during childhood
D. meiosis in at least one of the parents

10. Would two individuals who had tuberous sclerosis always have children with the disorder?

A. Yes. If both parents have tuberous sclerosis, all of their gametes will contain mutated versions of TSC1 and TSC2.

B. Yes. All children of parents with tuberous sclerosis should have the disease unless a spontaneous mutation occurs.

C. No. It is possible that a child could inherit normal TSC1 and TSC 2 alleles from parents who have the disease.

D. No. If both parents have tuberous sclerosis, their children will be carriers of the disease but will not display any symptoms of the disease.

11. An individual born with TSC as a result of gonadal mosaicism has parents that do not have the disease. If a pedigree of three or fewer generations were to be constructed for this individual and their family, the pattern of inheritance that would likely be suspected is:
A. sex-linked recessive
B. sex-linked dominant
C. autosomal recessive
D. autosomal dominant 12. Some tuberous sclerosis patients who develop kidney cysts are often undiagnosed until kidney damage or blood loss and anemia occur. Which of the following problems might a patient with anemia have?
A. a reduced oxygen-carrying capacity
B. a high hematocrit count
C. an elevated erythrocyte count
D. problems with blood clotting

Questions 13-18 are based on the following passage.

Passage III

The discovery and development of various types of anesthesia have revolutionized modern medicine, allowing many medical procedures to be performed with minimal discomfort to the patient. Local anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation in a particular area, while general anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation along with loss of consciousness. Both procaine (also known as novocaine) and lidocaine are drugs used for local anesthesia, and they have similar mechanisms of action. The drugs affect neurons in the local areas to which they are applied by preventing the opening of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels in the neurons.

Procaine and lidocaine have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, procaine has the ability to cause vasoconstriction in addition to its analgesic properties. However, lidocaine induces anesthesia faster and for a longer period of time than procaine. In addition to being used as an anesthetic, lidocaine is often used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, a condition where the cardiac muscle displays rapid, uncoordinated, and weak rhythms. The drug causes decreased excitability of the ventricles by blocking $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels, while the sinoatrial node in the right atrium is unaffected by the drug.

Procaine has a half-life of up to $0.5$ hours in patients. When procaine is metabolized in the body, it is converted to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and PABA is then excreted by the kidneys. Lidocaine is twice as potent as procaine, but lidocaine is also twice as toxic. The half-life of lidocaine in patients is typically between $1.5$ and 2 hours. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver by two enzymes that produce the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. SECTION 1:

Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems MCAT

Practice Test 2 13. If lidocaine is provided intravenously to a person with compromised liver function and a person with normal liver function, one hour later you would expect to see:

A. an increased plasma concentration of lidocaine in the patient with normal liver function as compared to the patient with compromised liver function

B. a decreased plasma concentration of glycinexylidide in the patient with normal liver function as compared to the patient with compromised liver function

C. an increased level of monoethylglycinexylidide in the urine of the patient with normal liver function as compared to the patient with compromised liver function

D. all of the above

14. How would blocking gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels prevent the transmission of messages in nerves?

A. If gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are blocked, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentrations remain higher inside the neuron than outside of the neuron.

B. If gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are blocked, the neuronal membrane cannot depolarize.

C. Blocking $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels would prevent the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$pumps from properly functioning.

D. Blocking $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels would prevent neurotransmitters from binding to receptors at the synapse.

15. A neuron under the influence of an anesthetic such as lidocaine would MOST likely:

A. display decreased neurotransmitter release at the synapse

B. show increased enzymatic degradation of neurotransmitters in the synapse

C. show increased reuptake of neurotransmitters in the synapse

A. a valve in the heart

B. the pacemaker of the heart

C. the barricade between the right and left side of the heart that keeps oxygenated and deoxygenated blood from mixing

D. a regulator of blood pressure in the heart

Questions 19-24 are based on the following passage.

Passage IV

Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that plays important regulatory roles in mammalian processes as diverse as inflammation, blood flow, kidney function, and development. Nitric oxide is created from L-arginine using the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). In studies using mouse models, NO has been shown to be a critical regulator of early embryo development. Manipulation of $\mathrm{NO}$ in the mouse embryo at the two-cell stage of development can prevent further development of the embryo to the blastocyst stage of development.

In order to determine a more specific role for NO in early development, 2-day mouse embryos (composed of two cells) were subjected to treatment by either sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or L-arganine methyl ester (L-NAME). Sodium nitroprusside is a NO donor, while L-NAME is a NOS inhibitor. In addition to a control group, three concentrations of SNP and three concentrations of L-NAME were tested. Each group consisted of 100 embryos. After the appropriate treatment, the number of embryos continuing to the blastocyst stage was counted and reported as follows:

\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline Group & Treatment & Number of Embryos Reaching the Blastocyst Stage \\
\hline 1 & Control & 84 \\
2 & $0.1 \mu \mathrm{M}$ SNP & 88 \\
3 & $1.0 \mu \mathrm{M}$ SNP & 45 \\
4 & $10.0 \mu \mathrm{M}$ SNP & 0 \\
5 & $0.1 \mu \mathrm{M}$ L-NAME & 52 \\
6 & $1.0 \mu \mathrm{M}$ L-NAME & 35 \\
7 & $10.0 \mu \mathrm{M}$ L-NAME & 9 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

19. Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate treatment for the control group in this experiment?
A. treatment with a known amount of SNP associated with a known value of NO needed to continue development
B. treatment with SNP at a level lower than $0.1 \mu \mathrm{M}$
C. treatment with L-NAME at a dosage higher than $10.0 \mu \mathrm{M}$

A. a solid ball composed of many cells that undergo mitosis
B. a diploid, fertilized egg
C. a ball of cells containing a fluid-filled cavity
D. a loosely formed ball of cells that performs meiosis

24. Diabetics typically have lower levels of nitric oxide (NO) than individuals without diabetes. Low levels of NO can be associated with vascular inflammation and vascular damage, leading to reduced blood flow to extremities. Which of the following may help a diabetic patient?
A. administration of L-NAME
B. administration of SNP
C. administration of L-NAME and SNP
D. administration of SNP and an L-NAME antagonist

Questions 25-30 are based on the following passage.

Passage $\mathrm{V}$

For many years, researchers have been interested in developing edible vaccines that would provide protection against various bacterial and viral diseases. An edible vaccine is a genetically modified organism (GMO) that is created when genes from the bacteria or virus being vaccinated against are inserted into plant cells. As the plants grow, they produce proteins from the bacteria or virus that the researchers are attempting to vaccinate against. When a person eats the plant, the viral or bacteria proteins serve as antigens, which initiates a primary immune response.

Some of the plants that are of interest in edible vaccine development are bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, rice, tobacco, and soybeans. While early research focused on growing crops that produced edible products such as bananas, the most recent research is focused on extracting material from the leaves and seeds of the plants, dehydrating it, and putting it into capsules that can be swallowed. This allows for a more predictable dosage of the vaccine and eliminates concerns that the crops containing the vaccine would be accidentally eaten by individuals who are not in need of the vaccine. The term edible vaccine has now been replaced with the term plantderived oral vaccine.

The development of plant-derived oral vaccines solves many problems associated with injectable vaccines. Because plant-derived oral vaccines are grown in crops, there is no problem with storage or refrigeration that is required of most traditional vaccines. These plant-derived vaccines also require no special training to administer. Additionally, when a vaccine is taken orally, it provides mucosal immunity due to the production of IgA antibodies by the immune system-in addition to systemic immunity. Since 90 percent of diseases enter the body through a mucus membrane, a vaccine that coerces mucosal immunity is of great benefit in the prevention of many diseases.

25. Suppose that an individual has been given a plant-derived oral vaccine against a specific virus. How could you determine whether the vaccine was effective?

A. Test for the presence of interleukins in the blood of the patient.

B. Test for the presence of interferons in the blood of the patient.

C. Test to determine whether the complement system in the blood had been activated.

D. Test for the presence of antibodies to the viral antigen.

26. In order to engineer a plant-derived oral vaccine, genes from the microbe to be vaccinated against must be placed into the plant genome. Which of the following choices would be the most reasonable way to achieve this goal?

A. Perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify copies of the bacterial or viral genes and then insert the copies into the plant cells by transduction.

B. Insert the bacterial or viral genes of interest into a plasmid, which can serve as a vector to transfer the gene to the plant cell.

C. Clone the genes into a bacterial cell and allow it to conjugate with a plant cell.

D. Use DNA hybridization to allow the genes of interest from the bacterial or viral genome to hybridize with the plant DNA. SECTION 1:

Biological and

Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems MCAT

Practice Test 2 27. The goal of any type of vaccination is to induce active immunity without people getting ill from the disease that they are being vaccinated against. In order to have long-term effectiveness, the vaccine must cause the development of which type of cells in the immune system?
A. cytotoxic T cells
B. helper T cells
C. plasma cells
D. memory cells

28. When a vaccine is given orally, it must pass through the digestive system before being absorbed into the bloodstream, whereas injected vaccines enter the bloodstream directly. What problems might vaccine developers be concerned about with a plant-derived oral vaccine that has to pass through the digestive tract?

A. There would be concern that the vaccine would not work quickly enough if it had to travel through the digestive tract.

B. There would be concern that stomach acidity might damage the bacterial or viral proteins that were expressed by the plant cells of the vaccine.

C. There would be concern that the vaccine might elicit an inflammatory response in the digestive tract.

D. all of the above

29. Plant-derived oral vaccines produce bacterial or viral proteins that serve as antigens in the body. Which of these events would occur first when a new antigen enters the body?
A. production of antibodies from plasma cells
B. presentation of the antigen by a macrophage
C. secretion of interleukin-2 from helper T cells
D. attack of the antigen by cytotoxic $T$ cells

30. A traditional vaccine that is administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously would be expected to cause the formation of which type of antibodies initially following administration?
A. $\operatorname{IgE}$
B. IgG
C. IgM
D. IgA

Questions 31-36 are based on the following passage.

Passage VI

Interleukins are cytokines or cell-signaling molecules. They come in many varieties and play numerous roles in modulating all aspects of the immune response. Interleukins are produced by many types of cells, and their secretion occurs rapidly, and typically briefly, as needed. Interleukins travel to target cells where they bind to receptors on the target cell, ultimately causing a cascade of events in the target that alter the behavior of that cell. Different types of microbes stimulate the release of different types of interleukins. The type of interleukins secreted will ultimately influence how the system responds to the infection.

An immunologist suspects that a recently discovered interleukin called interleukin X might be important in protecting against hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection. In order to test this possibility, two strains of mice are used-a knockout strain and a wild-type strain. The strain of knockout mice used in this study has a loss of function mutation in the interleukin $\mathrm{X}$ gene. During the experiments to determine whether this new interleukin X might protect against HCV, the mice are exposed to an analog of HCV. Three weeks later, liver biopsies are taken from each of the mice. From the biopsied liver tissues, nucleic acids are extracted and polymerase chain reaction is used to detect the presence of $\mathrm{HCV}$.

In the following data table, you will see data from 10 sets of mice in this experiment. A plus sign (+) indicates that PCR testing detected the presence of HCV and a minus sign $(-)$ indicates that PCR testing did not detect the presence of HCV.

\begin{tabular}{lllllllllll}
\hline Animal Number & $\mathbf{1}$ & $\mathbf{2}$ & $\mathbf{3}$ & $\mathbf{4}$ & $\mathbf{5}$ & $\mathbf{6}$ & $\mathbf{7}$ & $\mathbf{8}$ & $\mathbf{9}$ & $\mathbf{1 0}$ \\
\hline Wild-type & $-$ & $+$ & $-$ & $-$ & $+$ & $-$ & $-$ & $-$ & $-$ & $-$ \\
Knockout & $+$ & $+$ & $-$ & $+$ & $+$ & $-$ & $+$ & $-$ & $+$ & $+$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

31. From the data presented, what can you conclude about the potential for this new interleukin $\mathrm{X}$ to protect against HCV infection in mice?
A. The new interleukin provides no protection against viral infection.
B. The new interleukin provides complete protection against viral infection.
C. The new interleukin may provide some level of protection against viral infection.
D. The new interleukin enhances viral infection.

32. Based on the data shown here, which of the following would provide support for the potential of the new interleukin $\mathrm{X}$ to prevent viral infection?
A. finding that wild-type mice tested negative for $\mathrm{HCV}$ in the presence of reduced interleukin $\mathrm{X}$ levels
B. finding that knockout mice tested negative for HCV in the presence of supplemental interleukin $\mathrm{X}$
C. finding that knockout mice tested negative for HCV in the absence of supplemental interleukin $\mathrm{X}$
D. finding that wild-type mice tested negative for $\mathrm{HCV}$ in the presence of increased interleukin X levels

D. an individual with a mutation in the receptor for interleukin $\mathrm{X}$

Questions 37-42 are based on the following passage.

Passage VII

The process of quorum sensing is observed in a variety of species. It involves a system of communication between organisms that is dependent on population density. Bacteria are notorious for using quorum sensing (QS) via the secretion of secreted signaling molecules, called autoinducers (AI), to coordinate their gene expression once a threshold density of population is reached. Not only can bacteria communicate via QS within their species, but they can also cross-talk through QS between different species. In order to participate in quorum sensing, bacteria require a way to produce an autoinducer and a way to respond to autoinducers via binding to specific receptors.

One example of how bacteria use quorum sensing to their advantage is to regulate the gene expression of virulence factors. During infection, if a small number of bacteria were to express their virulence factors, this would largely have no impact on the host. Instead, bacteria wait until a quorum is reached in terms of population size, indicating that the population is large enough to express virulence factors. These virulence factors relate to such abilities as escaping the immune response, invasion, and spreading within the host.

We know that we are facing a current healthcare crisis related to the loss of effectiveness of many traditional types of antibiotics based on bacterial resistance. This provides a major impetus for identifying novel ways to target bacterial pathogens that avoid the use of antibiotics. Several chemical compounds and molecules have been identified as facilitators of quorum sensing inhibition. Typically, these factors can serve as signal-targeting enzymes or small-molecule inhibitors of signal synthases and receptors.

37. Autoinducers often act in positive feedback loops. This would mean that the production of an autoinducer would lead to:
A. the production of more autoinducer
B. the production of less autoinducer
C. upregulation of autoinducer receptors
D. downregulation of autoinducer receptors

38. What sort of advantage would quorum sensing provide to bacterial populations as compared to the organisms within the population acting independently of one another?
A. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to express genes collectively when the impact of those gene products will be maximized on their host.
B. Quorum sensing allows individual bacteria to express a higher level of virulence than they could when acting in the absence of quorum sensing.
C. Quorum sensing reduces the metabolic expenses for the majority of the population while increasing metabolic expenses for just a few members of the population.
D. Quorum sensing allows members of a population to outcompete other populations for resources within the host.

39. Decreased density of a bacterial population should lead to:
A. increased expression of autoinducers
B. decreased expression of autoinducers
C. increased expression of virulence
D. increased enzymatic degradation of autoinducers

Biochemical

Foundations of Living Systems 40. Quorum sensing is used frequently within populations of bacteria such as Practice Test 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa that form biofilms within their host. Once a quorum is reached, expression of the genes required for biofilm formation occurs. From the bacterial perspective, what direct advantage does the formation of biofilms provide?

A. It provides a strong attachment to surfaces of the host.

B. It enhances virulence expression of the organisms involved in the biofilm.

C. It provides increased resistance to antibiotics.

D. It enhances the secretions of toxins.

Questions 43-48 are based on the following passage.

Passage VIII

Genetically modified (GM) foods contain DNA from more than one source. The goal of creating GM foods is to modify the organisms to express new and useful traits. A few examples involve engineering crops to be resistant to bacterial or viral infections, to be resistant to herbicides, to ripen more slowly, to survive extreme temperature changes, to contain vaccines, or to create crops that are more nutritious.

One GM food that has received media attention over the years is golden rice. This GM product was first introduced in 2000 and was engineered to provide carotene that is a precursor to vitamin $\mathrm{A}$. The carotene in the rice provides the golden color. Vitamin A deficiency is a major problem in underdeveloped parts of the world, killing more than one million people a year, most of whom are children. This vitamin is critical for the development and maintenance of epithelial tissues, for vision, and for growth.

Rice plants normally produce carotene in the inedible parts of the plant. To be able to access and use the carotene, it was necessary to engineer the rice to produce it in the edible grains. In order to achieve this goal, two genes from daffodil plants, psy and $l y c$, and a bacterial gene called $c r t 1$ were added to the rice genome. These genes engineered a pathway that produces lycopene, which is eventually converted to carotene. Each of these genes was placed under the control of a grain-specific promoter so that the products were produced in the rice grains.

While golden rice was produced to provide carotene, which the human body can convert into the essential vitamin A, the rice provided much less carotene than was anticipated. Golden rice 2, a modified version released in 2005, contains a much larger amount of carotene and, as such, is a better source of the vitamin. Field tests were conducted in 2009, and human consumption trials were completed in 2012. However, neither version has been grown in large-scale quantities at this time.

43. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be produced in a variety of ways. In the case of golden rice, genes from the daffodil plant and bacteria were added to the rice genome. Which of the following would be necessary to remove the genes from these other organisms so that they could be added to rice?
A. reverse transcriptase
B. a viral vector
C. restriction enzymes
D. polymerase chain reaction

44. The engineering of golden rice to have several exogenous genes that can be induced under the control of a single promoter would MOST resemble:
A. an operon system
B. hybridized DNA
C. a vector
D. Okazaki fragments

45. When preparing GM organisms, it can be easier to get a eukaryotic cell to express bacterial genes than it is to get a bacterial cell to express eukaryotic genes. What might be the MOST reasonable explanation for this?
A. Bacteria are more simplistic organisms, and it is more difficult to get them to express complex eukaryotic genes.
B. The ribosomes of bacteria are different from eukaryotic ribosomes, and they have difficulty translating eukaryotic mRNA.
C. Eukaryotic genes contain introns that must be spliced out prior to translation in order to make a functional protein. Bacteria lack the ability to perform RNA splicing.
D. Bacterial cells recognize eukaryotic DNA as foreign and use nucleases to destroy it before it can be expressed.

Questions 3-7 are based on the following passage.

Passage I

Amino acids are amphiprotic molecules; they contain a carboxylic acid group and a basic amino group. The structure of an $\alpha$-amino acid can be represented by the structure:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_6cd4336cff91b16b536cg-20.jpg?height=103&width=201&top_left_y=1152&top_left_x=1076)

There are 20 common amino acids, each with a different R group. The simplest one has $\mathrm{R}=\mathrm{H}$ and is called glycine. Glycine has two acidic protons. The carboxylic acid proton is more acidic. It has a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of $2.4$. Below this $\mathrm{pH}$, it is protonated. Above this $\mathrm{pH}$, it is in the carboxylate form.

The amino group has a $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ of 9.8. Below this $\mathrm{pH}$, it is protonated; above this $\mathrm{pH}$ it is in the form $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$.

Every amino acid has a form called the zwitterion, which contains both a positive charge and a negative charge, and net zero charge. The $\mathrm{pH}$ at which the zwitterion exists is called the isoelectronic $\mathrm{pH}$, or $\mathrm{pI}$. The $\mathrm{pI}$ for a diprotic amino acid is found by taking the average of the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ 's.

\section{Experiment}

A 50.0-mL sample of $0.050 \mathrm{M}$ glycine was acidified to $\mathrm{pH} 2$. Then it was titrated with $0.10 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaOH}$. The $\mathrm{pH}$ was monitored continuously during the titration using a $\mathrm{pH}$ meter. The base was added in $1.0-\mathrm{mL}$ increments until $\mathrm{pH} 3.0$; then it was added in 0.30-mL increments until $\mathrm{pH} 8.0$, when the volume of base added was changed to 1.0-mL increments once more. The $\mathrm{pH}$ was recorded after each increment was added, and the titration curve was drawn.

Questions 8-14 are based on the following passage.

Passage II

A motion sensor, a device that relies on sound to continuously determine the changing location of an object, is used to graphically display its motion in terms of velocity versus time and acceleration versus time graphs.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_6cd4336cff91b16b536cg-22.jpg?height=577&width=1219&top_left_y=1251&top_left_x=564)

For example, if the person walks away from the motion sensor, the resulting distance versus time graph will be displayed:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_6cd4336cff91b16b536cg-22.jpg?height=350&width=336&top_left_y=1966&top_left_x=1011)

The velocity of the person moving away from the motion sensor at the same rate can be determined by calculating the slope of the graph:

$$
\text { velocity }=\text { slope of distance versus time graph }=\frac{\text { rise }}{\text { run }}=\frac{\text { change in distance }}{\text { change in time }}
$$

The acceleration of the person can be determined in the same way by calculating the time rate of change of velocity.

A person performs the following series of movements in front of the motion sensor:

Activity 1:Starting directly in front of the motion sensor, walk away from the sensor slowly, stand still, and then continue walking away from the sensor slowly.

Activity 2: First standing still directly in front of the motion sensor, walk away from the sensor quickly, stand still, and then walk away from the sensor slowly.

Activity 3: Standing approximately 3 meters in front of the motion sensor, walk toward the sensor quickly, stand still, and then walk away from the sensor quickly.

Activity 4: Standing approximately 3 meters in front of the motion sensor, walk toward the sensor quickly; then move toward the sensor slowly and then stand still.

8. For the person standing directly in front and walking away from the sensor at a steady pace, the velocity versus time graph would be represented by which graph?

Questions 29-33 are based on the following passage.

\section{Passage $\mathrm{V}$}

A student performed qualitative tests on a series of unknown chemicals in order to identify them. The unknowns included $\mathrm{NaCl}, \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$, sugar $\left(\mathrm{C}_{12} \mathrm{H}_{22} \mathrm{O}_{11}\right), \mathrm{MgSO}_{4}$, $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, cornstarch, and chalk $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$. These are all household chemicals. $\mathrm{MgSO}_{4}$ is Epsom salts, $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ is baking soda, and $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ is photographic fixer. The student was asked to identify six unknowns: A, B, C, D, E, and F.

The qualitative tests were based on the following:

$>$ Solubility in water: starch is insoluble, as well as one of the other compounds. The rest are soluble in water.

$>$ Chalk produces a gas when treated with acid.

$>$ Starch turns blue when treated with iodine.

$>\mathrm{MgSO}_{4}$ produces a milky precipitate when treated with aqueous ammonia.

$>\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ turns pink when treated with phenolphthalein.

$>\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ decolorizes iodine solution.

$>\mathrm{NaCl}$ conducts electricity in solution.

$>$ Sugar does not conduct electricity in solution.

The student prepared a flowchart that would aid in doing the experiments in a systematic manner and allow efficient identification of the unknowns.

\section{Experiment}

The experiments were conducted in the following order. The solubility of each chemical in water was tested first. From those results, the insoluble unknowns were tested next. The unknowns that were soluble in water were tested as aqueous solutions, rather than SECTION 2:

\section{Passage VI}

Plants are able to perform all of the necessary functions and processes to maintain life through photosynthesis-the biochemical conversion of sunlight to the important nutrient, sugar, and the uptake of water through its roots. The uptake of water from the roots, through the stem, and into the tissue of the plant occurs via capillary actionthe motion of fluid through extremely small vessels or tubes. Capillary action involves the interaction of the following two types of forces: adhesive forces that allow the water's molecules to adhere or stick to the plant tissues and cohesive forces that provide an attraction between water molecules. Upward movement of the water through the capillary vessels occurs when the adhesive forces are greater than the cohesive forces. The height, $h$, that the water will ascend up the plant depends upon the surface tension, $T$, of the water according to the equation:

$$
h=\frac{2 T}{\rho g r}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of water $\left(=1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right), g$ is the acceleration due to gravity $\left(=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right)$, and $r$ is the radius of the plant stem.

To explore capillary action, the following experiment was conducted to determine the effects of sugar in water transported up the stem of identical carnation flowers. Three beakers were each filled with $0.5 \mathrm{~L}$ of water. One beaker (beaker 1) was set aside with no sugar added to the water. Fifteen grams of sugar was added to the water in the second beaker (beaker 2), and 30 grams of sugar was added to the water in the third beaker (beaker 3). Also added to each beaker were 10 drops of red food dye. A carnation was placed in each beaker and observed at 2-hour intervals, marking the height of the dye in the carnation stem. The data are presented in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hline Time (hr) & Height of Dye $(\mathbf{c m})$ Beaker 1: No Sugar & Height of Dye $(\mathbf{c m})$ Beaker 2: 15 g Sugar & Height of Dye $(\mathbf{c m})$ Beaker 3: 30 g Sugar \\
\hline 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
2 & $2.41$ & $0.32$ & $0.15$ \\
4 & $4.17$ & $1.69$ & $0.80$ \\

Passage VIII

Visible light is electromagnetic waves that travel at a constant speed of $c=3.0 \times 10^{8} \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}$ and range in wavelength from $400 \mathrm{~nm}$ (violet) to $700 \mathrm{~nm}$ (red). As light travels from one medium to another, light changes direction or refracts, a phenomenon that is important in image formation. All transparent media, such as air, water, glass, and oil, are characterized by an index of refraction, a value that indicates the amount by which the speed of light through that medium slows down. The index of refraction is defined as:

$$
n=\frac{c}{v}=\frac{\text { speed of light in vacuum }}{\text { speed of light in medium }}
$$

As light passes from one medium (medium 1) to another medium (medium 2), the angle of refraction of light through medium 2 (as measured with respect to the normal or vertical axis) is related to the angle of incidence of light through medium 1 through Snell's law of refraction:

$$
n_{1} \sin \theta_{1}=n_{2} \sin \theta_{2}
$$

This is depicted in the following figure:

Refraction is important in image formation in the human eye. In the normal vision process, light passes through air $\left(n_{\text {air }}=1.000\right)$ and enters the eyeball through the cornea $\left(n_{\text {cornea }}=1.376\right)$, as shown in the following figure:

From the cornea, light enters the aqueous humor $\left(n_{\text {aqueous humor }}=1.336\right)$, passes through the lens of the eye $\left(n_{\text {lens }}=1.406\right)$, and enters a chamber filled with vitreous humor $\left(n_{\text {vitreous humor }}=1.337\right)$, where it then strikes the retina or the screen where the image is formed.

44. Red light of the visible spectrum has a wavelength of $700 \mathrm{~nm}$. The frequency of red light is:
A. $2.0 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}$

C. $2.0 \times 10^{17} \mathrm{~Hz}$
D. $4.0 \times 10^{17} \mathrm{~Hz}$

45. The speed of light as it travels through the aqueous humor is:

48. The majority of light refraction occurs in the human eye at the interface between:
A. air-cornea
B. cornea-aqueous humor
C. aqueous humor-lens
D. lens-vitreous humor The familiar $3 \%$ solution of hydrogen peroxide found in the local drugstore decomposes over time to form water and oxygen gas. The equation is:

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(a q) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(g)
$$

As the oxygen forms, the mass of the liquid $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ decreases. The mass difference is equivalent to the mass of oxygen that forms. This reaction occurs very slowly but can be sped up by the addition of a catalyst such as $\mathrm{I}^{-}$. One experimental method for determining the rate of the catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide requires measuring the mass difference over time intervals.

The molarity of the hydrogen peroxide solution at each interval can be calculated using a simple stoichiometry approach. The mass of oxygen is converted into moles, which is then multiplied by the ratio $2: 1$ to determine the moles of hydrogen peroxide that reacted. This value is then subtracted from the initial moles of hydrogen peroxide and then divided by the volume of the liquid sample.

To get the rate of reaction, a short time interval is used; the expression rate $=$ $\Delta\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right] / \Delta t$ represents the instantaneous rate as $t$ approaches zero.

\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline \multicolumn{3}{c}{ Data } \\
\hline Time (sec) & Mass $\mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{2}}$ Formed (g) & $\mathbf{M ~ H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{2}}$ \\
\hline 0 & 0 & $0.882$ \\
60 & $2.960$ & $0.697$ \\
120 & $5.056$ & $0.566$ \\

540 & $12.192$ & $0.120$ \\
600 & $12.608$ & $0.094$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

When the molarity is plotted against the time, a logarithmic curve results that approaches $M=0$ in an asymptotic fashion. At each point on the curve, the tangent represents the instantaneous rate of reaction. The rate constant for the reaction can be calculated using the rate equation:

$$
\ln \left([\mathrm{A}]_{\mathrm{o}} /[\mathrm{A}]_{\mathrm{t}}\right)=\mathrm{kt}

A. Men are more likely to use all four tactics.
B. Women are more likely than men to engage in violence against others.
C. Men are more likely than women to use resource display.
D. Women are more likely than men to use love and care.

6. Which of the following statements represents how evolutionary psychology interprets the results shown?

A. Men are more likely to use resource display because women value financial status as a characteristic in a mate; high financial status means that a man can support offspring and increase their likelihood of survival.

B. Men are more likely to use resource display because women like nice gifts from their mate.

C. Men are more likely to use resource display because it proves that they are powerful, and women are more loyal to powerful men out of fear.

D. women. because nonverbal possession signals are another means to indicate possession without directly interacting with potential competitors

Questions 10-14 are based on the following passage.

Passage II

Researchers investigating implicit and explicit memory have found that certain disorders may impair explicit memory but not implicit memory. In a historic study, E. K. Warrington and L. Weiskrantz (1970) gave a list of words to amnesics and control participants. All participants then completed four memory tasks. Two were standard measures of explicit memory (recall and recognition tasks), and two were indirect measures of implicit memory in which the participants were asked to complete word fragments by guessing what the completed word or fragment was. Each memory task consisted of participants reading and later being tested on their implicit and explicit memory for a list of words.

The results of this study are shown in the following graph:

Amnesic and control participants completed four memory tasks. Two were explicit tests (free recall and recognition) and two were implicit tests (word-fragment identification and word-stem completion). Source: Adapted with permission from E. K. Warrington \& L. Weiskrantz. "Amnesic syndrome: Consolidation or retrieval?" Nature. 1970:228(5272), 628-630. 10. What does the graph MOST likely indicate about explicit versus implicit memory for amnesics compared to control participants?

A. Amnesics perform worse on both explicit memory and implicit memory tasks compared to control participants.

B. Amnesics perform equally well as control participants on explicit memory and implicit memory tasks.

C. Amnesics perform better than controls on implicit memory tasks because there is no interference from explicit memories.

D. Amnesics experience significant impairment for explicit memory tasks but do not experience significant impairment for implicit memory tasks compared to control participants.

11. Prior to Warrington and Weiskrantz's research, psychologists believed that amnesics lacked the ability to encode or store information in long-term memory. However, based on their research, what is the MOST likely explanation for the amnesics' difficulty performing specific memory tasks?

A. Some amnesic participants are unable to remember new material but can access previously learned information to make judgments about current events.

B. Some amnesic participants are able to learn new information (encoding) but are unable to explicitly state what they have learned (retrieval).

C. Amnesic participants do not have any memory impairments when compared to control participants.

D. Some amnesic participants are unable to learn new information but are able to explicitly recall lists of words.

12. If these results were examined using Endel Tulving's model of memory (episodic, semantic, procedural), which of the following statements is MOST likely to be true?

A. Amnesic participants are able to encode and access semantic memory but are still impaired in their ability to retrieve the encoded information.

B. Amnesic participants are able to encode and access episodic memory but are unable to access semantic memory.

C. Amnesic participants have access only to procedural memories and therefore can only unconsciously follow scripts.

D. Amnesic participants can encode and access episodic, semantic, and procedural memory with no impairments because these are part of a separate memory system.

13. Based on previous research, what is the brain structure that is MOST likely impaired in the amnesic population?

Passage III

Research investigating different types of memory has found important differences between how those memories are recognized. The results of a hypothetical study are shown in the following graphs. In this study, during a training phase participants were instructed to listen to two separate study lists of musical sections, some familiar and some novel. Later, during a testing phase, participants listened to a mix including all of the initial melodies as well as an equal number of distractors. They were then asked to tell whether they had heard a melody during the training phase and, if so, which of the two study lists the melody was from.

Passage IV

A classic study investigating observational learning was conducted by the psychologist Albert Bandura. In his study he explored whether children would model violent behavior after watching film sequences that featured violence.

In this study, four groups of child participants watched three different film sequences (aggressive-model-rewarded, aggressive-model-punished, and nonaggressive model control). In an additional control group, child participants were not shown a film.

> In the aggressive-model-rewarded group, the participants watched a film in which a child was rewarded for violent behavior toward another child.

- In the aggressive-model-punished group, the participants watched a film in which a child was punished for violent behavior toward another child.

- In the nonaggressive model control group, the participants watched a film in which there was no violent behavior between children. The results of this study are shown in the following graph. Aggression is shown on the $y$-axis and the experimental and control groups are plotted on the $x$-axis:

\section{Passage VIII}

Research has examined how the presence of others affects how humans behave in different social contexts. This research has examined performance for different types of tasks and has also evaluated how group size affects performance. Studies have examined both internally motivated changes in behavior and losses due to coordination of activity with others (role duplication).

The following data represent a study conducted by B. Latané, K. Williams, and S. Harkins. In their study, they measured sound produced by individuals when asked to cheer or clap. They then manipulated the grouping conditions. Some individuals were alone, others were in actual groups of either two or six. Additional participants were told that they were placed into groups, but actually they were merely blindfolded and equipped with headphones (thus placing them in so-called pseudogroups). The decibels produced by each individual or group of individuals were measured for each condition. The results of this study are depicted in the following figure with group size depicted on the $x$-axis and sound produced in decibels depicted on the $y$-axis.

Practice Test 2 Questions 45-49 are based on the following passage.

Passage IX

Research investigating behavior in social situations has found that social behavior varies depending on the environment. Social behavior can involve either shallow acting or deep acting. Shallow acting requires altering facial expressions and body language so that on the surface, the individual conveys an emotion or opinion to conform to the social situation but does not really experience that emotion/opinion. Deep acting requires alteration of inner beliefs such that the individual believes the emotion or opinion he or she is expressing in order to conform to the situation.

In one study, deep acting and shallow acting in a social situation were examined for customer-service workers. These workers routinely interacted with customers by smiling at them, speaking with them, responding to their queries, and detailing the benefits of various products. Later, stress was assessed for these workers.

Hypothetical results are depicted in the following figure.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_bb2adad1406f706de601g-05.jpg?height=666&width=1219&top_left_y=1128&top_left_x=564)

Perceived stress from social interactions involving deep acting and shallow acting.

45. Based on the results of this study, which of the following is true?
A. Deep acting results in higher stress levels.
B. Shallow acting results in higher stress levels.
C. Stress levels are the same for both kinds of social behavior.
D. Shallow acting is likely to be more common because it is easier. 46. Based on the dramaturgical approach of this study, and the data in the figure, which of the following is true of social interactions?

A. The more social interactions that require shallow acting, the less perceived stress there will be.

B. Social interactions should ideally not involve any acting.

C. Social interactions involving deep acting should result in less stress.

D. The fewer social interactions that require acting, the greater the stress will be.

47. According to cognitive dissonance theory, why would shallow acting be more stressful than deep acting among customer-service workers?

A. Making sure that facial expressions and body language are consistent increases autonomic arousal and leads to elevated stress.

B. Deep acting requires that you change your beliefs; therefore, acting becomes less stressful.

C. Individuals with social anxiety are more likely to engage in shallow acting.

D. Deep acting provides more off-stage time compared to on-stage time.

48. Which of the following concepts involves an actor making sure that he or she chooses an "audience" comprised of people who will validate the actor's self-view?
A. self-verification
B. backstage self
C. off-stage behavior
D. self-referencing

49. According to the dramaturgical approach, when is an individual truly himself or herself?

A. when the individual is alone (off-stage)

B. when the individual has minimal interaction with others (on-stage)

C. when the individual engages in self-talk dialogue (on-stage)

D. when the individual engages in actions that cannot be seen by others (backstage)

Passage X

High levels of stress have been studied by a number of researchers. Research exploring stress and well-being has made some compelling discoveries. A common finding is that people who are under stress are more likely to report being sick than people who are under less stress. A 2002 study by N. Hamrick, S. Cohen, and M. S.

Directions: This section includes eight reading passages. Each passage is followed by a group of questions. Read each passage, and then select the one best answer to each question based on what you have read.

Questions 1-6 are based on the following passage.

Passage I

Sea beans. Ballast waifs. These adorable nicknames do not hint at the destructive nature of invasive plants. Sea beans are those plants whose seeds, buoyed by a pocket of air, float on the tide from one island to another, or even across vast stretches of ocean. Ballast waifs are less natural in origin; they are seeds that arrive on one shore from another in the soil placed in a ship's hold as ballast.

One remarkably lovely and dreadfully damaging ballast waif is Lythrum salicaria, the bright purple, spiky flower known commonly as purple loosestrife. Purple loosestrife is not a newcomer to U.S. shores; it arrived from Eurasia, almost certainly via ship, some 200 years ago. It was widely used for medicinal and ornamental purposes throughout the 19th century. Its lovely purple blooms may still be seen in gardens throughout the country, where people love it for its long growing season.

For all its beauty, purple loosestrife is a menace. The same long growing season that makes it so beloved by gardeners makes it a seed-making machine. A mature plant may produce 2 or 3 million seeds a year.

That is not enough for Lythrum salicaria, however. It also propagates underground, sending out shoots and stems in all directions. It is also able to cross-pollinate with other species of Lythrum.

Scientists took little notice of purple loosestrife until sometime in the 1930s, when a particular strain began colonizing along the St. Lawrence River, an area rife with the sort of wetlands purple loosestrife likes best. Purple loosestrife does not just propagate wildly; it also adapts easily to changes in environment. As it starts up in a new area, it quickly outcompetes native grasses, sedges, and other flowering plants, forming dense MCAT

Practice Test 2 stands of purple loosestrife where once heterogeneous wetland meadows existed. This not only eradicates the native plants, but it also removes food sources for migratory birds and other animals.

In recent years, purple loosestrife has had a devastating impact on native cattails and wild rice. It has invaded and destroyed spawning areas for fish. In rural areas, it is beginning to move away from wetlands and adapt to drier areas, encroaching on agricultural lands. In urban areas, it is blocking pipes and drainage canals. It has moved steadily westward and is now found in all states but Florida.

Attempts to control purple loosestrife have been only partially successful. It has proved resistant to many herbicides, and it is impervious to burning, as its rootstock lies beneath the surface and can reproduce from there. It can be mowed down and plowed under, and then replaced with a less invasive plant. This is very labor-intensive in marshy areas that are substantially overgrown, but it may be the only way of eliminating the pest. Plowing it under requires unusually large discs on the plow because it is important to chop up the rootstock. Gardeners who have planted purple loosestrife are encouraged to dig it up and replace it with other, less damaging plants.

The best plan may be to seek a natural enemy of purple loosestrife, a weevil or insect that will destroy the plant. However, finding such an enemy that will target only purple loosestrife while leaving other, preferred plants intact is a daunting task. More important than that, introducing yet another foreign species to American swampland may lead to problems that make our purple loosestrife infestation look mild.

Questions 7-12 are based on the following passage.

\section{Passage II}

Since soldiers first formed armies, there has been martial music. It provided rhythm for drilling and marching, and it raised morale before battle and weakened that of the enemy during battle. From the war drums of Native Americans to the messenger drums of the early Chinese, from the trumpets of the ancient Egyptians to those of the ancient Celts, music has accompanied men into battle.

Fife and drum corps were popular from the Renaissance on, but the military band we think of today did not really exist until the 18th century, when brass instruments and woodwinds were combined in European bands to form a martial sound that could be heard even above the cannons and muskets of the battlefield. That sound was supplemented beginning in 1720 with the novel sound known as Janissary music.

The Janissaries were an elite corps of Turkish soldiers whose music was particularly suited to a military corps. Janissary music used kettledrums, cymbals, triangles, tambourines, and unusual forms of percussion such as the "Jingling Johnny," a tall, Here in America, when we think of martial music, we think of John Philip Sousa and beloved marches on the order of "The Stars and Stripes Forever." However, 100 years earlier, Joseph Haydn used a Janissary style in his Military Symphony No. 100 in G Major, and Ludwig van Beethoven included a "Turkish March" in The Ruins of Athens. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart based his opera The Abduction from the Seraglio on Janissary percussion. As the 19th century began, it became popular to add a "Janissary stop" to pianos and harpsichords to provide a percussive accompaniment similar to that produced by the kettledrums of the Janissary corps.

As quickly as it had come, Janissary music passed out of favor, and by the middle of the 19th century, European and American bands had become formal, trained accessories to regiments, consisting typically of flute and piccolo, clarinets, oboe, saxophones, bassoons, horns, cornets, trombones, and percussion. In this country, the importance of martial music may have reached its peak during the Civil War, when every unit and regiment had its own small band. However, even today, according to Mother Jones, the Pentagon is the largest employer of musicians anywhere in the world, spending nearly $\$ 200$ million of taxpayers' money annually on bands from Guam to Washington, D.C.-approximately 10 times what the federal government spends on K-12 music education. No longer do these bands follow men into battle, however; their purpose today is largely ceremonial, and you are more likely to hear them at a state funeral than at the rear of a forced march.

C. purpose
D. value

8. In paragraph 4 , the word stop is used to mean:

A. I only
B. II only
C. I and III only
D. II and III only

11. In the 18th century, enlisting in the army became known as "following the drum." If the author included this information in the passage, it would probably be used to:

Questions 13-18 are based on the following passage.

Passage III

In the history of preemptive wars that end badly, we must consider the Zulu War of 1879. Like many wars of the 19th century, it was declared not by Parliament but rather by people on the scene. Sir Henry Bartle Frere was an emissary of the Queen, sent to Cape Town to find a way to unify the British and Boer colonies with a variety of independent black states to form a Confederation of South Africa. Standing in his way was the Zulu Army, a robust contingent of 40,000 warriors under the leadership of King Cetshwayo.

Frere looked for a way to seize Zululand. He used a series of minor border disputes to prompt an ultimatum to Cetshwayo, demanding that his army disband and be remodeled within 30 days. Cetshwayo refused to reply, which led to a state of war. A month and a half later, a British force invaded Zululand. They moved in three columns toward the royal compound.

On the 22nd of January, the middle column, led by Lord Chelmsford, a favorite of the Queen, split, with Chelmsford leading a large force to support a small reconnoitering party. The 1,750 left at camp soon found themselves surrounded by nearly 20,000 Zulus. Notice was sent to Chelmsford, but he would not be deflected from his plan. The resulting massacre at Isandhlwana reduced the middle column by 1,350 men. Some SECTION 4:

Practice Test 2 of the survivors retreated to Rorke's Drift, where they joined a small force of about 100 men who had successfully held off a few thousand warriors.

News of the massacre made its way to England, but Chelmsford, quite the modern military man, had already put a cover-up in place. He managed to convince the Queen and some of the press that Isandhlwana was overcome due to a lack of ammunition, and he put forth Rorke's Drift as a major victory, allowing that minor skirmish to be glorified as the massacre was all but forgotten. He would later blame Isandhlwana on the disobedience of an officer who died there.

Chelmsford's self-supporting propaganda was effective for a while, but as the Zulu War turned even bloodier, albeit more successful for the British, he was eventually recalled and replaced by Field Marshal Wolseley. Wolseley would command the British troops through the final campaigns of the Zulu War, campaigns that culminated in the capture of King Cetshwayo. The British divided up Cetshwayo's kingdom into 13 minichiefdoms, granting 11 to Zulus, 1 to a pro-British Basuto chief, and 1 to a white African mercenary. This plan led to many years of civil war, and in 1882, the British restored Cetshwayo to his throne, leaving his son in charge of a nearby territory. In 1883 that son joined with a band of Boer mercenaries and invaded his father's kraal, forcing his father into exile, where he soon died under mysterious circumstances. In league with the Boer who would become the first prime minister of South Africa, Louis Botha, a second son of Cetshwayo's attacked his brother and defeated his army. This son, Dinizulu, would be the last king of the Zulus to have any power. His land is now part of KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa.

13. In the context of the passage, the word campaigns means:
A. races between candidates
B. actions advancing a principle
C. related military operations
D. overland hunting expeditions

14. The discussion of Rorke's Drift is used primarily to show:
A. why the capture of the king was a forgone conclusion
B. how a minor success deflected attention from a major failure
C. the many ways that British forces outmaneuvered the Zulus
D. the use of British nomenclature to rename African landmarks

15. The passage suggests that the author would MOST likely believe that:
A. Chelmsford was a failure.
B. Chelmsford was a hero.
C. Frere was a hero.
D. Wolseley was a failure.

16. Each of these at some time ruled some or all of Zululand EXCEPT:
A. a white African mercenary

C. the amphibious raid by the Allies on Dieppe, Normandy
D. the removal by force of Saddam Hussein in Iraq

Questions 19-25 are based on the following passage.

Passage IV

The Shawnee people of the Ohio and Cumberland Valleys gave the American elk its other name, wapiti. Yet when we think of elk today, we rarely envision them as eastern animals. If we want to see elk in their natural habitat, we travel to Colorado or Montana, where they still roam the mountainous terrain.

Elk were, in fact, once found in the East, from Georgia north to New York and Connecticut. By the time of the Civil War, hunting and habitat destruction had caused their extinction in most eastern states. All of the eastern subspecies are now extinct. Elk County, Pennsylvania, and Elk County, Kansas, were without elk for more than a century.

At the beginning of the 20th century, herds of elk in the Rocky Mountains faced death by starvation as encroaching farms depleted their winter feeding and finally the government decided to intercede. They gathered up elk from Yellowstone National Park and shipped 50 of them to Pennsylvania. The elk were to be protected, with no hunting of them allowed until eight years had passed.

At that early date, 1913, there was little understanding of the kind of acclimatization required when moving large animals from one habitat to another. The elk were released from cattle cars and chased into the wild to fend for themselves. Two years later, 95 more elk were moved from Yellowstone to Pennsylvania.

Elk are large animals with large ranges, and the damage these elk caused to cornfields was substantial. The elk tended to move toward farming areas because that was where the food was. Farmers and poachers took some elk illegally, but the herds still began to grow. During the 1920 s, several hunting seasons went by with harvests of one or two dozen elk, but then the numbers declined dramatically, and the elk were again put under protected status. No real census was taken until 50 years later, in 1971. SECTION 4:

Analysis and Reasoning Skills 
by the early 1980s. By the year 2000, there were more than 500 elk in Pennsylvania, including many in Elk County.

In 1984 a group of hunters established the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, whose mission is to reintroduce elk in the states where they once roamed. The foundation runs into resistance from farmers and antihunting groups and generally requires majority approval from the community before animals are introduced. At present, new herds are established in Arkansas, Kentucky, Michigan, and Wisconsin in addition to Pennsylvania. There is talk of moving herds to Tennessee and to the Adirondack range in New York. It seems fairly clear that improving habitat for elk reintroduction improves conditions for other wildlife-wild turkey, whitetail deer, and black bear, among others.

Unlike the way things were done in the 1910s, today reintroduction is far more closely monitored and controlled. Animals are tested for disease. They are held in a large enclosure until they have acclimated to their surroundings. After a few weeks, they are released, but most have radio collars and/or ear tags that allow researchers to track their movements and habitat use. Research results help foresters know what to plant where in order to keep the herd healthy and help biologists know whether the herd is thriving or is in need of intercession. Land trusts are used to preserve habitat and to keep the elk from moving too close to cropland. The people in charge of elk reintroduction have no desire to live through another annihilation of the eastern wapiti.

Questions 26-33 are based on the following passage.

\section{Passage $\mathrm{V}$}

In linguistics, metathesis refers to the reversal of phonemes in a word. This can come about by accident, as in the common mispronunciation "aks" for ask or the common (and correct) pronunciation of iron as "i-orn." It may come about on purpose, as in various language games.

Accidental metathesis may be a process that takes place in the evolution of languages. Over time, for example, the Latin words miraculum, periculum, and parabola evolved into the Spanish words milagro, peligro, and palabra. Linguists posit that such SECTION 4:

Critical

Analysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT

Practice Test 2 changes usually occur when two consonants are of the same type, with similar mouth formations needed to create each one.

The Reverend Archibald Spooner, an Oxford dean, was known for his unintentional transpositions and gave his name to the particular metathesis he represented: Spoonerisms. Most famous Spoonerisms once attributed to Spooner are now believed to be apocryphal, but they are nevertheless amusing; for example, his supposed advice to a substandard student: "You have deliberately tasted two worms and will leave Oxford by the next town drain." Spoonerisms are funny when the metathesis involved changes one word into another, and they seem to lend themselves particularly well to off-color jokes.

Everyone is familiar with Pig Latin, in which initial consonant sounds are moved to the end of a word and followed with the syllable "ay." This is not pure metathesis, but it begins with the kind of metathesis known as backslang, in which syllables or letters in a word are reversed to produce a private code. Pig Latin may have begun as a language spoken in prisoner-of-war camps; it was certainly used in such camps during World War II and in Vietnam.

In Pig Latin, the phrase "Over the river and through the woods" becomes "Overay uhthay iverray anday oughthray uhthay oodsway." In other variations of Pig Latin, it might instead be "Overway uhthay iverray andway oughthray uhthay oodsway." There are computer programs that translate from English to Pig Latin and back again, and there is even a version of the Bible written entirely in Pig Latin. For the most part, however, outside of prisoner-of-war camps, Pig Latin is a funny code used by children.

French children and teenagers use a similar code. Called verlan (a reversal of l'envers, or "reversal"), it is trickier than Pig Latin because it relies much more on phonetics than on spelling. In verlan, the word café becomes féca, but the word tomber ("to fall") becomes béton. Verlan becomes even more complex in words that end in silent $e$ or which have only one syllable. While just a few words from Pig Latin have entered the vernacular (for example, amscray and ixnay), many verlan words are common lingo in France.

Historically, for reasons that are not quite clear, butchers have been frequent users of metathesis, creating their own backslang to converse without being understood by patrons. In France, this is called louchébem (boucher, or "butcher," with the first consonant moved to the end and the letter $l$ placed in front). In Australia, it is known as rechtub klat. That name, of course, represents the ultimate in metathesis-the reversal of letters instead of merely syllables.

Questions 34-39 are based on the following passage.

Passage VI

Philosophers generally recognize three different conceptions of totality. Atomistic thinkers, such as Descartes and Wittgenstein, believe that the whole is no more than the sum of its parts. A thorough study of these parts, atomists believe, will lead to an understanding of the whole. A contrasting view, held by Schelling, Hegel (although some scholars question whether Hegel's ontology actually conforms to this formalist conception of totality), and members of the structuralist school of philosophy, holds that the whole has an identity of its own, separate from the nature of its component parts. A third view, and perhaps the most challenging to explore, is the dialectical/materialist idea of the whole held by Karl Marx. In this view, the whole is seen not simply as the sum of its parts as atomists believe or as something independent of its parts according to formalist thought. Instead, the whole is conceived of as the constantly changing and evolving interactions between all of its component parts.

In Marx's view, there are no things—static, independent objects or ideas-there are only processes. Everything that makes up the world is constantly in the process of becoming, with both its past and its future encapsulated in the very notion of the object itself. Furthermore, according to the dialectical materialist view, all objects are interdependent and the interactions they have with each other are also parts of their totalities.

Critics of this perspective point out, somewhat justifiably, that such an ontology has a number of difficulties. One of their major objections is that dialectical materialism is impractical to employ in any meaningful way. Consider how thinking of even a simple object such as a chair in this way quickly leads to a surfeit of information, connections, and processes. For a chair is not simply a chair, but the result of the labor of an individual, a process of manufacturing, the needs of a society that requires chairs, and many other factors. And each of these factors has its own past (and future) and myriad other connections as well. The number of relationships increases exponentially, which quickly makes a dialectical worldview utterly overwhelming to even the most agile philosophical mind.

Marxist philosophers attempt to work around this potential pathology by invoking what is called the process of abstraction. Abstraction allows the philosopher to draw certain boundaries around the object, idea, or relationship studied. Typically, these abstractions involve deciding an appropriate time scale to consider, the level of generality necessary for understanding specific interactions, and the vantage point from which to view a particular object of study. Abstraction on these levels allows the philosopher to bring certain relationships and processes into greater focus in order to understand them, while always keeping in mind that such an abstraction necessarily obscures various other connections. Marx famously used this process in his study of capitalism, sometimes viewing the system from the vantage point of the capitalist, other times assuming the perch of the worker, and even at times trying to view the system from the perspective of capital itself. Similarly, sometimes Marx generalized people as simply members of their class in order to gain a better grasp of the relationship between owner and worker. Each new abstraction adds to the understanding of the system, and the process of abstraction must happen again and again in order to bring hidden connections into view.

34. The passage suggests that philosophical conceptions of totality:
A. have evolved over time from an atomistic view to a dialectical view
B. have prevented philosophers from grasping the inherent connections involved in all things
C. are based on three mutually exclusive conceptions of the relationships between part and whole
D. are limited to three competing and contrasting conceptions

35. The author MOST likely refers to the dialectical materialist view of totality as "most challenging" because:
A. Few philosophers other than Marx espouse it.
B. It appears to require unprecedented mental capabilities.
C. The insights it offers to a philosopher are overwhelming.
D. It cannot be employed without using the process of abstraction.

A. point out a complication involved with the dialectical perspective
B. provide an instance of dialectical abstraction
C. explain how manufactured objects fit into Marx's view of capitalism
D. demonstrate that dialectical thinking is impossible

37. The author believes that the dialectical materialist conception of totality:
A. provides insights into the world superior to the ones provided by the atomistic and formalist conceptions
B. may correctly be found objectionable on certain levels
C. is impractical when not paired with the concept of abstraction

Questions 40-47 are based on the following passage.

Passage VII

Biologists use the term "living fossil" to designate a species that maintains many of the features of its ancient ancestors. These species have evidenced very little evolutionary change, indicating not that they are primitive creatures as might be popularly believed, but instead that they are exquisitely suited for their biological and ecological niches and thus have not had any selection pressures to respond to.

The four most celebrated living fossils are the lungfish, the horseshoe crab, the lampshell, and the coelacanth. The horseshoe crab is the relative youngster of the group, belonging to the Jurassic period and having shown little structural changes in its 200-million-year lifespan. The lampshell, a member of the phylum Brachiopoda, is part of an even older lineage, resembling ancestors that lived nearly 400 million years ago.

The oldest members of the living fossil family are the lungfish and the coelacanth, both species that are remarkably similar to their forebears that roamed the Earth almost 425 million years ago. The lungfish, of which there are six surviving species, has the same basic structure and fleshy lobe fins of its progenitor, the sarcopterygian. Of course, the lungfish has long interested biologists not just because of its connections to the distant past but because of the bridge it represents between aquatic species and land dwellers. In fact, the African and South American species of lungfish live part of their lives entirely on land, burrowing into mud and respiring through a tiny breathing hole in their earthy homes. Although the lungfish has remained evolutionarily stable for close to 250 million years, prior to that the species did experience rapid and dynamic evolutionary change. However, by the end of the Permian period, the changes ground to a halt, and the lungfish has persevered happily ever since.

The singular story of the coelacanth stretches all the way from the Silurian period, some 425 million years ago, to the modern day. The coelacanths were well-known from the fossil record and dating technologies placed them in a time when plants were just beginning to encroach on the land. However, biologists thought the species went extinct long before the dinosaurs did. Imagine the surprise when in 1938 a South American trawler captured a strange-looking fish, some five feet in length and a pale blue and silver in color. By an astounding coincidence, the captain of the boat had a relationship with the curator of the East London Museum and had made a habit of sending any interesting finds along to her. Upon seeing this strange specimen, the curator contacted a leading ichthyologist, who, after examining the creature, said he "would not have been more surprised if I had seen a dinosaur walking down the street." But despite all protestations of common sense and amid allegations of forgery and fakery, upon further study, the creature was indubitably a coelacanth.

Questions 48-53 are based on the following passage.

Passage VIII

For years, a great many political scientists have been puzzled by what appears to be the most basic of all political questions: why vote? Of course, it's not that voting is an overly troublesome or burdensome activity; commonsense explanations of voting behavior are often borne out through empirical study. People vote in order to express their preferences for a particular candidate or platform, to demonstrate their civic pride, or to involve themselves in the political process. The puzzle lies instead in the actual act of voting, which in many ways conforms to what social scientists term the "free-rider problem." Any social good that spreads both costs and benefits amongst a number of citizens encourages the citizens to attempt to reap the benefits without incurring the costs. Given the almost infinitesimal chance that any one individual's vote would actually affect the outcome of an election and given that the supporters of the winning candidate all share equally in the benefit of that candidate's election, the costs of voting, no matter how minor they may be, appear to make voting an irrational act. Better to stay home on election day and let the others do the heavy lifting, the thinking goes.

But the fact is people do get up on election day and vote. Various theories have been postulated to explain this seemingly irrational behavior, but there are three factors that political scientists return to again and again: resources, mobilization, and instrumental motivation.

Resources refer to both material possessions such as money and transportation, and immaterial things such as time and political knowledge. Mobilization refers to the pressures the media, political parties, and other groups can exert on an individual in order to make him or her feel compelled to vote. Instrumental motivation is the extent to which a person believes his or her vote will actually affect the outcome of the election.

Of these three critical factors, resources has received the most scholarly attention. According to a classic view of voting behavior, people vote because they have the time and the money to do so. Some political scientists have even calculated what they call a baseline model of political participation. This model attempts to predict political participation based on an individual's level of education, income, and several other occupational variables. Certain individual traits may affect the final decision, but the theory holds that the level of resources is a better predictor of political behavior than any other factor.

Unfortunately, this model, while achieving some success when applied to actual political behavior, suffers from a serious flaw. The model becomes useless when the voting behaviors of citizens from other countries are compared. The differences in voter turnout across educational levels and income are smaller than the differences found in turnout across various countries. Additionally, countries with higher per capita levels of education and income are not necessarily the countries with the highest voter turnout. Indeed, the United States and Switzerland, two countries that are at the top or near to the top of the list in terms of per capita education level and income have some of the lowest voter turnout numbers.

48. According to the passage, the problem that puzzles political scientists is:
A. what motivates people to vote
B. why people consider voting an irrational act
C. what makes people think the benefits of voting outweigh the costs
D. whether voting is a case of the free-rider dilemma MCAT

Practice Test 2 49. The "thinking" referred to in the last sentence of the first paragraph ("Better to stay home on election day and let the others do the heavy lifting, the thinking goes") would MOST likely be attributed to:
A. political scientists
B. free riders

A. a lawyer
B. a Swiss citizen
C. a U.S. citizen
D. a homemaker

I. a large amount of free time

II. get out the vote drives

III. a sense of the significance of one's vote
A. I only
B. II only
C. II and III
D. I, II, and III

52. According to the passage, the baseline model of political participation is:
A. applicable only to isolated cases of voting behavior
B. an accurate predictor of voting behavior
C. more useful in countries with lower voter turnout
D. more useful in countries with higher voter turnout

53. The passage implies that:
A. Resources are the key factor in explaining voting behavior.
B. The effects of mobilization and instrumental motivation on voter turnout have been ignored by scholars.
C. No theory of voting behavior will successfully explain voter turnout.
D. Explanations of voting behavior involving mobilization have not received the same attention as other explanations.

\section{ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS}

\section{Section 1. Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems}

1. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. Increasing $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ion concentration should drive the reac- Passage I tion to the left, which causes the production of carbonic acid (choice A). If the reaction continues, the carbonic acid would be converted to carbon dioxide and water. This would eliminate choice B, which suggests that the carbon dioxide levels would decrease. Since the reaction is driving to the left, bicarbonate ion levels should not increase, so choice $\mathrm{C}$ can be eliminated. The passage indicates that carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the reaction in both directions, so its activity should be increased when $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ion concentration increases.

2. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Increased levels of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ in the plasma should lead to an increased production of carbon dioxide and water. Increased levels of carbon dioxide are the primary trigger for ventilation. If carbon dioxide levels are high, the ventilation rate should increase. The presence of carbonic acid would decrease $\mathrm{pH}$ as opposed to increasing $\mathrm{pH}$ (suggested by choice C).

3. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question is simply asking for how carbon dioxide is produced on the cellular level. You should recall your knowledge of the process of cellular respiration. During aerobic respiration, glucose goes through glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. During Krebs cycle, carbon dioxide is released. Therefore, carbon dioxide is formed in the cells as a by-product of glucose metabolism. Protein synthesis and nucleic acid metabolism do not produce carbon dioxide as by-products.

4. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question is about osmotic effects. We are told that the process of dialysis needs to remove excess fluids (water) from the blood. In order to do this, the dialysis fluid must have more solutes and less water than the blood. This would mean that the dialysis fluid must be hypertonic to the blood. Another way to say this is that the blood must be hypotonic (contain less solutes and more water) than the dialysis fluid (choice C). If the patient's blood was isotonic to the dialysis fluid, there would be no net movement of water. If the blood were hypertonic to the dialysis fluid, water would enter the blood.

5. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. Increasing the levels of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions excreted in the urine should increase the concentration of the urine. As the urine becomes more concentrated, osmotic effects occur, and extra water will be excreted with the urine in an attempt to dilute the urine. This will increase the urine volume (choice A). MCAT

Practice Test 2 6. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The question indicates that the toxins being referred to are small in size. We can assume that they are at a high concentration in the blood as compared to the concentration of the dialysis fluid. Choice A can be eliminated because active transport moves substances from a lower concentration to a higher concentration. In this case, we want to move the toxins from a higher concentration (the blood) to a lower concentration (the dialysis fluid). This would indicate that diffusion (choice B) would be appropriate. Osmosis deals only with the movement of water, which will not help move the toxins out of the blood.

Passage II 7. The correct answer is D. Sex-linked inheritance can be quickly eliminated as males and females seem to be equally affected based on the pedigree. Since autosomal inheritance is obvious, it is necessary to determine if the pattern is characteristic of a dominant or recessive condition. Recessive traits are notorious for "skipping generations" in pedigrees, which means that affected children often come from unaffected parents. To be affected, the individual must be homozygous recessive. The parents do not have the disease, but they are unknowing carriers (heterozygotes), which gives them a $25 \%$ chance of having an affected offspring. In dominant autosomal inheritance, the affected individual can be homozygous dominant or heterozygous. This means that in order for a child to have the disease, the child must have inherited at least one mutated allele from his or her parent who also had the disease. The only exception would be if spontaneous mutation occurred. When affected individuals appear in each generation of a pedigree, dominance should be suspected.

8. The correct answer is C. TSC1 and TSC2 are the normal alleles. Only mutated versions of these alleles cause tuberous sclerosis, according to the passage. The passage indicates that the gene products of TSC1 and TSC2 are hamartin and tuberin, both of which are tumor suppressors. If an individual were to overexpress TSC1 and TSC2, more of the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products would be produced; so we would suspect that their levels of hamartin and tuberin would be elevated. This should provide extra protection against tumor formation, which is indicated by choice C.

9. The correct answer is D. The passage explains that individuals who developed tuberous sclerosis as the result of gonadal mosaicism come from parents who do not have the mutated TSC1 and TSC2 alleles in their somatic cells. Since we already determined that the pattern of inheritance for this condition is autosomal dominant, we know that the affected individual only needs to receive a mutated version of TSC1 or TSC2 from one parent. Since individuals inherit their alleles through the egg and sperm of their parents, it is reasonable to expect that the gonadal mosaicism form of tuberous sclerosis must come from a mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene on one of the parent's gametes. Since gametes are made using the process of meiosis, it would seem that the mutation occurred during this process, leaving choice $\mathrm{D}$ as the best answer. 10. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question relies on the fact that you have already determined that the normal pattern of inheritance for tuberous sclerosis is autosomal dominant. Since affected individuals could be heterozygous for the mutated versions of TSC1 and TSC2, it would be possible that half their gametes carry the normal alleles while the other half would carry the mutated alleles. Assuming both parents with the disease are heterozygous, a Punnett square would indicate that $25 \%$ of the offspring would be homozygous recessive and would not have tuberous sclerosis.

11. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. We have already established that tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal condition. The passage explains that individuals with the gonadal mosaicism form of tuberous sclerosis come from parents who do not carry the mutated TSC1 and TSC2 alleles in their somatic cells. However, some of their gametes carry the mutation. Since the somatic cells do not have the mutated alleles, these individuals do not appear to have tuberous sclerosis. If a pedigree were to be constructed, it would show two unaffected parents producing a child with the disease. This would resemble autosomal recessive inheritance where "skipping generations" is typical.

12. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. This question is asking about anemia, which has many causes. But anemia is always characterized by either a low erythrocyte count or a low hemoglobin count. The question indicated that tuberous sclerosis often occurs as the result of blood loss, which would indicate that the type of anemia occurring would be characterized by low erythrocyte counts and low hemoglobin counts. Since the function of hemoglobin is to transport oxygen, and the hemoglobin and erythrocyte counts are low, it would be expected that oxygen-carrying capacity would be reduced.

13. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The passage explains that lidocaine is metabolized in the liver and produces two metabolites: monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. If we are comparing a person with normal liver function to one with compromised liver function, there will be a difference in how long it takes to clear lidocaine from the system. If the liver function is impaired, it is expected that lidocaine will stay in the plasma longer as it waits to be metabolized by the liver. Therefore, the plasma concentration of lidocaine in the liver-compromised patient should be higher after 1 hour than in the patient with normal liver function. The faster lidocaine is metabolized by the liver, the faster the metabolites would be expected to enter the plasma and ultimately be excreted by the kidneys. Choice $C$ is correct because it suggests that one of the metabolites of lidocaine, monoethylglycinexylidide, would be processed by the liver and kidneys more quickly in the normal patient as compared to the liver-impaired patient.

14. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question requires an understanding of resting potentials and action potentials in the neurons. Recall that resting potentials (polarization) of neuronal membranes are maintained due to an unequal balance of ions that allows for the inside of the neuron to be more negative than the outside Answers and Explanations Passage III 

MCAT

Practice Test 2 of the neuron. This is primarily due to the action of $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$pumps, which utilize large amounts of ATP to maintain an unequal balance of ions. In the polarized state, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is found in high concentrations outside the neuron and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is found in high concentrations inside the neuron. The neuron also contains a variety of negatively charged molecules. In order for a message to be sent, the membrane needs to depolarize. This is characterized by the opening of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels, which allow $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to flood the inside of the neuron, temporarily (and locally) making that area of the neuron more positive inside than outside. This action potential will propagate the length of the neuron, where it will ultimately coerce the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. Blockage of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels would essentially keep the neuron in resting potential where $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is restricted to outside the neuron. Blocking $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels prevents the initiation of the action potential or depolarization of the membrane.

15. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. Since lidocaine blocks $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels, we have already established that it prevents the initiation of action potentials in the affected neurons. Normally, as action potentials propagate, they eventually cause the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. Since action potentials are impaired in lidocaine-treated neurons, we should expect that there will be fewer neurotransmitters released into the synapse.

16. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The passage indicates that lidocaine is an analgesic (prevents pain) by blocking $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gates channels in neurons. Since glial cells are not neurons, choice D can immediately be eliminated. In order to prevent pain from being processed, the messages must be prevented from entering the central nervous system where interneurons are located. Therefore, sensory neurons must be blocked. If these are blocked, the interneurons do not receive the pain messages and motor neurons will not act on them.

17. The correct answer is C. Vasoconstriction means that vessel diameter narrows, restricting blood flow to the area. The question introduces the idea of using novocaine during surgery. Since the drug causes vasoconstriction, this would actually increase blood pressure, eliminating choice A. The best choice is C. Bleeding is likely to occur during surgery, so vasoconstriction should slow the blood flow, which results in less blood loss.

18. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question relies on your knowledge of the anatomy of the heart and the conducting system of the heart. The sinoatrial node (SA node) is a group of conducting cells located in the right atrium. Recall that the valves of the heart are atrioventricular (AV) and semilunar valves. The barricade that divides the right and left side of the heart is the septum. The SA node generates electrical signals that control cardiac muscle contractions and serves as the pacemaker for the heart.

Passage IV 19. The correct answer is D. It is important to provide controls in experimental designs. Control groups should be treated the same as the treatment groups except for the one variable that is being tested. The control group either receives no treatment or receives a placebo (which is not a form of treatment) to make the subject believe that he or she is receiving a treatment. Choices A, B, and C all suggest that the control group should be treated with one of the two drugs (SNP or L-NAME), which removes them as viable options. In the experiment described in the passage, the control group should not be provided with either drug (SNP or L-NAME), which is indicated by choice D.

20. The correct answer is A. To answer this question, you need to analyze the data provided. Looking at the number of embryos surviving, you should notice that all three groups treated with any dosage of L-NAME had decreased survival as compared to the control group. The passage explains that L-NAME is a NOS inhibitor. If the enzyme needed to convert L-arginine to NO does not work, then NO levels will be decreased. The data suggest that a decreased level of $\mathrm{NO}$ provided by the L-NAME treatment is detrimental. Further, the higher the dose of L-NAME, the more inhibition of NOS and the less NO provided, led to a dose dependent decrease in survival that eliminates choice $\mathrm{C}$ as an option. The passage also explains that SNP is a NO donor, which increases NO levels. According to the data provided for the SNP groups, a small increase in NO (seen in group 2) seems to increase embryo survival. However, as the SNP dose becomes larger (and the higher the level of NO provided), this will lead to decreased survival. The highest rates of survival were seen in the $0.1 \mu \mathrm{m}$ SNP group, and survival decreased with increased dosage of SNP. This would eliminate choice B since increasing levels of NOS would increase NO levels similar to SNP treatment. The data show that SNP treatment (which increases NO levels) is most detrimental to embryo survival. Choice D directly contradicts this. The best conclusion is that $\mathrm{NO}$ is necessary for development, since the data showed that the NO inhibition leads to decreased survival. However, only a certain amount of NO is needed as high levels also lead to decreased rates of embryo survival.

21. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Group 1 was the control group, so there would be no need to further investigate that group. This eliminates choice A. Groups 4 and 6 showed drastic decreases in embryo survival, eliminating choices $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{D}$. However, group 2 (choice B) showed an increase in embryo survival, which would suggest that further research within that dosage would be appropriate.

22. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The question relies on your knowledge of the anatomy of the female reproductive system and the events of fertilization. As a follicle ruptures in the ovaries, the ovum would be released into the oviducts. Sperm should enter the vagina, moving up the uterus and into the oviducts. Sperm should encounter the ovum in the oviducts where fertilization should occur. This eliminates choices A, B, and D, leaving choice $\mathrm{C}$ as the correct choice.

23. The correct answer is C. This question also relies on your knowledge of early development. After fertilization, the zygote (a diploid, fertilized egg) begins cleavage, which is rapid mitotic cell division. This results in a solid ball of cells. Eventually, the center of this structure hollows out to form a cavity. This stage of development is the blastocyst stage. Choice A can be eliminated because it suggests that a blastocyst is a solid ball of cells when it really is a hollowed-out structure. Choice B suggests a diploid, fertilized egg, which is actually called a zygote. Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 2 Choice D suggests that there is a ball of cells that perform meiosis. Since we know the only cells to perform meiosis are the gametes, choice D can be eliminated. Choice C correctly describes the structure of the blastocyst.

24. The correct answer is B. The passage explains that SNP is a NO donor, which increases NO levels. Since decreased levels of NO can cause reduced blood flow to the extremities, increasing levels of NO may improve blood flow for a diabetic patient.

Passage $\mathrm{V}$ 25. The correct answer is D. This question relies on knowledge of the immune response. Interleukins are cytokines that are secreted during the process of clonal selection in primary immune responses. Since they are not specific toward any one particular antigen, choice A can be eliminated. Interferons are produced as nonspecific defenses against viral infections. Virally infected cells secrete interferons that are detected by neighboring cells. Secretion of interferons gives neighboring cells the chance to increase their immune defenses so that they do not become infected by the virus. Since interferons are nonspecific, their presence would not indicate immunity against a specific virus, which eliminates choice B. The components of the complement system circulate in the plasma and are activated by bacteria that may enter the blood. Activation of the complement system ultimately lyses and kills the bacterial cell. Since the question is asking about a virus, choice C can be eliminated because it deals with bacteria. This leaves choice $\mathrm{D}$ as the correct response. The detection of antibodies against the viral antigen would indicate that specific defenses were initiated and that plasma cells were activated to secrete antibodies against the viral antigen that was presented by the vaccine.

26. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to amplify copies of target DNA, it would not help to get the viral or bacterial genes of interest into plant cells. This eliminates choice A. Choice $C$ suggests that the genes could be cloned into a bacterial cell and transferred to a plant cell by conjugation. Conjugation is unique to certain species of bacteria and occasionally is seen in fungi, but it does not happen in plants. So choice $C$ is eliminated. Choice D suggests that the genes of interest should be hybridized to the DNA of the plant. Since hybridization occurs between complementary base pairs, this would suggest that the DNA sequence of the gene of interest and the plant would have to be the same, which is not the case. This leaves choice B as the best option. Bacterial or viral genes can be spliced into plasmids. The plasmids serve as vectors to deliver the gene of interest to a variety of cell types, including plants.

27. The correct answer is D. Once activated, most cells in the immune system do not live long. Activated cytotoxic T cells and plasma cells are inactivated once the antigen that they have been designed to fight has been eliminated. The basis of long-term immune system protection is the development of memory T and memory B cells (choice D). These memory cells are produced upon primary exposure to a specific antigen and have the ability to survive for years within the body. Should the same antigen return, memory cells quickly proliferate into cytotoxic T cells and plasma cells to fight the antigen. 28. The correct answer is B. All vaccines take time to work (often weeks before full immunity occurs), so waiting for an oral vaccine to pass through the digestive tract (which takes no more than a few hours) is not of major concern. This eliminates choice A. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ suggests that inflammation in the digestive tract might be a problem. Since the inflammatory response is expected as one of the nonspecific immune defenses, it is not of major concern. Since two choices have been eliminated, choice D is no longer an option. This leaves choice B as the correct response. Since the plant has been engineered to express proteins unique to the virus or bacterium being vaccinated against, it is possible that these proteins might be damaged in the stomach. Recall that the function of the stomach is to digest proteins by using the enzyme pepsin.

29. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question requires an understanding of the specific defenses of the immune system. The ultimate goal of the specific defenses is to allow for the production of antibodies from plasma cells and the production of cytotoxic $\mathrm{T}$ cells. However, neither of these things can occur without the activation of a helper $\mathrm{T}$ cell. In order to activate the helper $\mathrm{T}$ cell, macrophages must phagocytize foreign antigens. The fragments of these antigens will be displayed on the surface of the macrophage. This antigen presenting cell will then activate the helper $\mathrm{T}$ cell.

30. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. IgM antibodies are produced first in response to exposure to a new antigen. Later, IgG antibodies will be produced.

31. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Based on the data presented, more of the knockout mice tested positive for the virus than the wild-type mice. Since the knockout mice had the new interleukin gene disrupted, they would not produce this new interleukin, which could be the reason that most of the knockout mice tested positive for the virus.

32. The correct answer is B. If wild-type mice were provided with supplemental interleukin $\mathrm{X}$ and tested negative for $\mathrm{HCV}$, it is possible that this could be attributed to the presence of interleukin $X$.

33. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The polymerase chain reaction works by using primers specific to a target sequence. In the presence of that sequence, the primers bind and the target sequence is copied. After multiple cycles, many copies of the target gene are present and can be detected. In the absence of that sequence, the primers do not bind and nothing will be amplified.

34. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The question specifically noted that we were looking for something that was part of the innate set of immune defenses. Of the choices provided, interferons are the only option that would be typical in viral infection.

35. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Because this is an RNA virus that must produce additional RNA viruses, the enzyme's RNA polymerase would be the logical target given that it copies RNA. Reverse transcriptase is unique to retroviruses, and DNA polymerase and DNA gyrase would be used for DNA replication.

36. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Of the choices provided, $\mathrm{C}$ is the most plausible. Increased expression of receptors for the new interleukin could lead to a higher level of Answers and Explanations Passage VI MCAT

Practice Test 2

Passage VII interleukin activity in the cells. If this interleukin is effective against viral infection, increased activity might lead to better protection.

37. The correct answer is A. In positive feedback loops, a stimulus is amplified in the feedback loop. In this case, if the stimulus is the production of an autoinducer, a positive feedback loop would stimulate the production of more autoinducer. This is in contrast to negative feedback loops where the response in the feedback loop is the opposite of the stimulus.

38. The correct answer is A. If bacteria can coordinate their efforts to express certain genes, they are more likely to impact their host as compared to if a single cell were to express a gene product on its own. For example, if bacteria were to express a virulence factor, such as a toxin, the impact of that from a single cell would be minimal on the host. However, if the entire population expressed that toxin in a coordinated manner, the impact would be much greater on the host.

39. The correct answer is B. As the population of bacteria decreases, and there is less likelihood of a quorum, there is less accumulation of autoinducers within the population. As the population increases, autoinducer expression should increase as well.

40. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The advantage of biofilm formation is that it provides a direct and strong attachment to its host. Biofilms are notoriously difficult to eradicate, and the bacteria within them are provided protection against many variables, sometimes including antibiotics.

41. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. This question relies on your knowledge of the structure of organic molecules. The N-AHLs in this question should be recognized as some derivative of an amino acid. Given that information, the most likely way to alter them would be by altering their R group side chains.

42. The correct answer is D. Antibiotics must target structures that are unique to prokaryotic cells. Of the choices listed, the nucleus is a structure lacking in prokaryotic cells and therefore could not serve as a target for antibiotics.

Passage VIII 43. The correct answer is C. Restriction enzymes are known to cut DNA at specific recognition sequences and are valuable tools for excising genes to be transferred from one source to another. Reverse transcriptase is used to copy RNA to DNA. Viral vectors can carry DNA of interest into other cells, but they are not used to remove genes from an organism. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to produce multiple copies of a target DNA sequence.

44. The correct answer is A. A series of several genes under the control of a single promoter is most similar to the inducible operon system in bacteria. Okazaki fragments are produced during semiconservative replication on the lagging strand of DNA. Strands of DNA that are hybridized are complementary to each other. A vector is used to carry DNA from one source into another.

45. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Bacterial ribosomes are in fact different from eukaryotic ribosomes. However, the genetic code is universal so there should be no problem translating the proteins. When eukaryotic DNA is introduced to bacterial cells, it is contained in a vector such as a plasmid that is a normal component of many bacterial cells. We know that eukaryotic genes contain introns and prokaryotic genes do not. If a eukaryotic gene is placed in a prokaryotic cell, the introns cannot be removed and the mRNA produced will contain introns. When translated, the intended protein will not be produced.

46. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This question is asking which of the types of tissue listed are epithelial. Skeletal muscle is muscular tissue, adipose tissue is connective tissue, and bone is connective tissue. Epidermal tissue is made of stratified squamous epithelial tissue.

47. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Vaccines are designed to work by stimulating the primary immune response of the recipient. This requires the immune system to recognize an antigen and to mount a specific immune response. Ultimately, this leads to the production of memory cells that can survive for long periods of time. When the system is challenged by the actual antigen, different types of memory cells can quickly proliferate into plasma cells and cytotoxic $\mathrm{T}$ cells in order to destroy the antigen.

48. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Genetically modified organisms contain one or more additional genes as compared to their non-GM organism equivalents.

49. The correct answer is C. Blood is a fluid made up of liquid plasma (55\%), the primary component of which is water, and floating cells (45\%). The plasma is richly endowed with dissolved proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates.

50. The correct answer is A. This problem can be solved through knowledge of each of the various hormones given in the four options. Antidiuretic hormone maintains control of water balance in the human body by stimulating increased water reabsorption by the kidneys. Luteinizing hormone stimulates secretion of sex hormones by ovaries and testes. Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulates the adrenal glands. Growth hormone regulates a wide variety of activities involved in growth and metabolism.

51. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The pancreas is the source for two hormones: insulin and glucagon. Among its principal effects, insulin stimulates glycogen formation and storage, stimulates carbohydrate oxidation, and inhibits gluconeogenesis. All of these effects are described in choices A, C, and D. The other hormone, glucagon, stimulates conversion of glycogen into glucose. So choice B is the correct answer.

52. The correct answer is A. The superior vena cava is the vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the upper half of the body to the heart into its right atrium. The aorta is the largest and longest of the arteries of the human body that transports oxygenated blood directly from the left ventricle to all other organs and tissues in the body. The hepatic portal vein is the major vein that transports blood from the digestive organs into the liver. The carotid artery is one of two types of arteries (the other being vertebral) that feed blood from the heart and into the head/ brain area. Answers and Explanations No passage MCAT

Practice Test 2 53. The correct answer is C. Pulmonary gas exchange is always based on simple diffusion. Diffusion allows for the movement of a substance from an area of high concentration of the substance to an area of low concentration of the substance. Depending on the concentrations, oxygen and carbon dioxide will move in variable directions. Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and $\mathrm{D}$ indicate that the movement of gases always occurs in a fixed direction, which is incorrect.

54. The correct answer is C. Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles including a nucleus. Their DNA is circular and does not exist as linear chromosomes. Prokaryotic cells can have a cell wall, but it is typically made of peptidoglycan. The only item on this list that is common between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is that they both contain ribosomes needed for protein synthesis within the cell.

55. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This question relies on your knowledge of nutrient breakdown through the digestive system. In the stomach, the primary activity is protein digestion. The enzyme pepsin is activated by the acidity of the stomach. If the stomach $\mathrm{pH}$ were to be increased, there may not be enough acid to activate pepsin. This would mean that proteins would not be digested in the stomach. However, the pancreas produces proteinases that can work on protein digestion in the small intestine.

56. The correct answer is C. The four major tissue types are listed as choices. Nervous tissue is unique in its communication abilities. Muscular tissue is characterized by bundles of cells with the ability to contract. Epithelial tissue is characterized by sheets or layers of cells that connect to underlying tissues via a sticky basement membrane. Only connective tissues are characterized by cells scattered in a nonliving matrix that often contains fibers such as collagen.

57. The correct answer is $C$. The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration is the amount of ATP generated. Anaerobic respiration generates 2 ATP per molecule of glucose, while aerobic cellular respiration generates about 36 ATP per glucose molecule.

58. The correct answer is $C$. This problem requires a Punnett square to be performed for each generation. For the first generation, the Punnett square for the genetic cross of $\mathrm{TT} \times \mathrm{tt}$ or:

In the first generation, the $\mathrm{T}$ and $\mathrm{t}$ gametes unite to produce individuals with a Tt (heterozygous) genotype. In the second generation, the Punnett square is conducted for the genetic cross of $\mathrm{Tt} \times \mathrm{Tt}$ or:

Answers and Explanations

The phenotypic results from this cross are that three of the four pea plants will be tall (TT, Tt, and Tt) and one of the four is short (tt). Thus, the phenotypic ratio of dominant to recessive pea plants is 3:1, given by choice C.

59. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Steroid hormones exert their effects by entering into cells and binding with a receptor in the cytoplasm. The hormone-receptor complex then enters the nucleus where it acts to alter gene expression in the cell. Since the question is asking about nonsteroid, or peptide, hormones, choices A and B can be eliminated. Choice D can also be eliminated as this is not a plausible explanation. Nonsteroid hormones act as first messengers binding to their receptors on the cell membrane. The hormone itself does not enter the cell. The binding of the first messenger to the receptor causes a series of reactions in the cell that ultimately activate second messengers, such as cAMP. MCAT

Practice Test 2

\section{Section 2. Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems}

1. The correct answer is A. As the frog follows the parabolic trajectory, the horizontal component of its velocity, which can be calculated by $v_{i, x}=v_{i} \cos \theta_{i}$, is positive and remains constant throughout the entire trajectory. Based on this information, one can readily exclude choices B and C as possible answers. The vertical component of velocity begins with its maximum (positive) value at the origin, calculated by $v_{i, y}=v_{i} \sin \theta_{i}$, and then follows according to the equation:

$$
v_{f, y}=v_{i}(\sin \theta)-g \Delta t
$$

Thus, at $\Delta t=0$, the vertical component of velocity of the frog is at its positive maximum value, which decreases until it reaches zero as the frog reaches the maximum altitude or the highest point of its trajectory. As the frog continues past the point of its maximum altitude, the vertical component of velocity begins to increase, but, because the frog is now moving downward, it is negative. The negative values are indicated by the graph moving linearly under the positive $x$-axis. When the frog lands, the magnitude of the vertical component of velocity is equal to its value at launch but its direction is opposite to that of its launch. The pair of graphs that best represents both components of velocity in projectile motion is choice A.

2. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The energy stored in a capacitor is given by the formula:

$$
\mathrm{E}=1 / 2 \mathrm{CV}^{2}=1 / 2\left(30 \times 10^{-6}\right)\left(6 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~V}\right)^{2}=540 \mathrm{~J}
$$

Passage I 3. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The endpoints occur when 1 and 2 equivalents of base have been added. According to the graph, these would be at $\mathrm{pH} 6$ and $\mathrm{pH} 12$.

4. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. At $\mathrm{pH} 2$, the amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions in solutions is plentiful. Therefore, both the carboxylic acid and the amino groups are protonated.

5. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Above a $\mathrm{pH}$ of $2.4$, the carboxylic acid is in the carboxylate form. The amino group is protonated below a $\mathrm{pH}$ of 9.8. The zwitterion will exist between $\mathrm{pH} 2.4$ and $\mathrm{pH} 9.8$, making a $\mathrm{pH}$ of 6 the correct answer.

6. The correct answer is B. A titration is a slow process where titrant is added drop by drop until the endpoint is reached. However, knowing where the steep slope is, one can add more base to begin with and then slow down as the endpoint is approached. Near the endpoint, the slope increases sharply in this area, so smaller increments are needed.

7. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The concentration of the base is twice that of the glycine, so half as much volume is needed to reach the first endpoint. A 50.0-mL sample of $0.050 \mathrm{M}$ glycine will require $25.0 \mathrm{~mL}$ of $0.10 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaOH}$ to reach the first endpoint.

Passage II 8. The correct answer is B. Because the person is walking at a steady pace away from the motion sensor, the velocity is constant. For each increment of time, the corresponding slope (rise over run) that is the velocity is equal in value throughout the entire activity. Thus, the graph that best illustrates this activity is choice B. 9. The correct answer is $C$. Because the person is walking at a steady pace away from the motion sensor, the velocity is constant. As noted from the previous problem, the graph on a velocity versus time graph is a horizontal line at a nonzero positive value, determined by magnitude of the person's pace. Acceleration, which can be determined by the time rate of change of velocity over time, is zero, because the velocity is constant. This graph is represented by choice $\mathrm{C}$.

10. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. In this activity, the person starts at some distance 3 meters away from the motion sensor, which means the graph would have to start at a positive, nonzero value of distance. This readily eliminates choices A and D as possible answers. Since the person is walking toward the motion sensor, the student is walking toward the origin, represented by choice C.

11. The correct answer is B. Activity 1 starts with the person standing directly in front of the motion sensor and then walking away from the sensor slowly. This translates into a positively increasing graph (because the person is walking away from the sensor) with a small slope (because the person is walking slowly). The person then stands still, which means the distance remains the same (horizontal line) over that segment. In the final segment, the person walks away, which reveals a graph similar to the first segment appended to the horizontal graph. This is represented by choice B.

12. The correct answer is D. In Activity 2, the person starts by standing still (a horizontal line on a distance versus time graph) in front of the motion sensor. The person then walks away from the sensor quickly, described by a positively increasing graph because the person is walking away from the sensor and with a steep slope because the person is walking quickly. In the final segment, the person continues to walk away, again yielding a positively increasing graph but with a smaller slope because the person is walking as opposed to moving quickly. This is represented by the graph in choice D.

13. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. In Activity 3, the person starts from a distance of 3 meters and walks toward the motion sensor quickly. Because the person walks toward the motion sensor, the velocity will be negative and represented by a horizontal line for that segment because the person is walking at a steady pace. Because the person moves quickly, the magnitude of the velocity will be greater than if the person was walking slowly. At this point, choices $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ would both be acceptable choices. The person then stands still, which means the velocity is zero and will be zero throughout the entire segment. The person then walks away from the sensor quickly, which is described by a horizontal line of the same magnitude as the first segment but positive because the person is walking away from the motion sensor. The correct answer is choice $\mathrm{C}$.

14. The correct answer is D. In Activity 4, the person starts from a distance of 3 meters and walks toward the motion sensor quickly. Because the person walks toward the motion sensor, the velocity will be negative and represented by a horizontal line for that segment because the person is walking at a steady pace. Because the person moves quickly, the magnitude of the velocity will be greater than if the person was Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 2 walking slowly. The person then walks toward the sensor slowly, which is described by a horizontal line of smaller magnitude than the first segment but still negative because the person is walking toward the motion sensor. In the final segment, the person stands still, resulting in a zero velocity (horizontal line along the $x$-axis). The correct answer is choice D.

Passage III 15. The correct answer is C. The aqueous phase most effective for providing a pure product would be $1 \mathrm{M}$ sodium hydroxide. The TLC analysis clearly indicates the presence of benzoic acid in the crude reaction mixture. The challenge becomes how to separate benzoic acid from the desired ester using aqueous extraction alone. By using sodium hydroxide in the aqueous phase, benzoic acid is deprotonated to form benzoate, which is soluble in water, as shown. The desired ester lacks the acidic proton and is therefore unaffected by base.

16. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The first task is to determine the limiting reagent, which is the alcohol (as shown):

\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\hline Substance & MW (g/mol) & $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{g} / \mathbf{m L})$ & Amt added & mmol \\
\hline Benzoic acid (1) & $122.0$ & $-$ & $1.58 \mathrm{~g}$ & $13.0$ \\
Thionyl chloride & $119.0$ & $1.631$ & $1.04 \mathrm{~mL}$ & $14.3$ \\
(S)-2-methyl-1-butanol (2) & $88.2$ & $0.819$ & $1.19 \mathrm{~mL}$ & $11.1$ \\
Dichloromethane & $84.9$ & $1.325$ & $20.00 \mathrm{~mL}$ & (solvent) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Therefore, the theoretical yield for the product would be $11.1 \mathrm{mmol} \times$ $192 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}=2.13 \mathrm{~g}$. The isolated (purified) yield is $1.49 \mathrm{~g}$ (according to the experimental), meaning the actual yield is $1.49 \mathrm{~g} / 2.13 \mathrm{~g}=70 \%$ of theory.

17. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The defining characteristic of the product in the IR spectrum is the carbonyl stretch, which should appear about $1700 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. Spectrum B is the only one that exhibits this band in the IR. Spectrum A shows a stretch at $2200 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, which indicates a nitrile; Spectrum $\mathrm{C}$ shows a stretch at $3300 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, which is consistent with an alcohol; and Spectrum D contains no diagnostic peaks aside from C-H and C-C stretches.

18. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The rate would increase. The second reaction involves the $\operatorname{Ad}_{\mathrm{N}}$ reaction between an alcohol and an acyl chloride, as shown here:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_bb2adad1406f706de601g-41.jpg?height=140&width=788&top_left_y=2186&top_left_x=780)Since the subsequent reactions (loss of chloride and proton transfer) are rapid, this is the rate-limiting step. Therefore, the rate law for this reaction would be:

\section{rate $=k[\mathrm{BzCl}][\mathrm{ROH}]$}

Increasing the concentration of alcohol ( $\mathrm{ROH})$ would then increase the reaction rate.

19. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The reaction between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid is very slow. The formation of an ester can be catalyzed by a strong acid (such as sulfuric acid or $p$-toluenesulfonic acid). However, in this particular case, the acid is first converted to a much more reactive acyl chloride using thionyl chloride, as shown:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_bb2adad1406f706de601g-42.jpg?height=143&width=458&top_left_y=823&top_left_x=714)

20. The correct answer is C. The answer choices are best considered as two sets of two: two boat conformations and two chair conformations. Boat conformations in general are almost always of higher energy owing to the so-called flagpole interactions shown here:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_bb2adad1406f706de601g-42.jpg?height=109&width=192&top_left_y=1165&top_left_x=847)

The distinguishing characteristic between the two chair conformations is that one (choice C) places the chlorine substituent in an equatorial attitude, whereas the other (choice D) forces the substituent to occupy an axial position. An equatorial orientation is almost always energetically preferable.

21. The correct answer is D. The first part of the Strecker synthesis involves the nucleophilic addition of ammonia onto the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde, as shown. The aldehyde therefore functions as an electrophile.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_12_09_bb2adad1406f706de601g-42.jpg?height=138&width=412&top_left_y=1647&top_left_x=737)

22. The correct answer is C. In the second part of the Strecker synthesis, a nitrile group is converted to an acid functionality. The two oxygen atoms in the latter are supplied by water, making this a hydrolysis reaction. Oxidation and reduction can be ruled out by examination of the oxidation state of carbon in the reactant (nitrile) and product (acid). In both compounds, the reactive carbon (in blue) has three bonds to an electronegative element-nitrogen in the nitrile and oxygen in the acid. The oxidation state of the blue carbon is $+3$ in both cases; therefore, no redox chemistry has occurred.

$$

Answers and Explanations No passage Passage IV MCAT

Practice Test 2 23. The correct answer is $D$. The valine synthesized in the Strecker synthesis is best described as a racemic mixture and optically inactive. The product of this reaction (valine) clearly has a chiral center; therefore, the two achiral responses are invalid. Since the synthesis launches from an achiral material, and no chiral reagents are introduced along the way, the only reasonable outcome is to have a racemic mixture of enantiomers. Note that the chiral center is set in the first part of the synthesis (attack of cyanide on the iminium intermediate). Since the attack can occur from either face of the iminium with equal probability, we expect to see an exactly $1: 1$ mixture of enantiomers. Any racemic mixture is optically inactive because for every molecule that rotates light clockwise, there exists an enantiomer, which will rotate light counterclockwise, resulting in no net rotation.

24. The correct answer is $D$. In the presence of sodium hydroxide, the amino acid (3) will become deprotonated and form the aminocarboxylate (i.e., 4), which will be water soluble. The aminonitrile (2), on the other hand, lacks an acidic proton and will remain neutral. Thus, it will be dissolved in the dichloromethane, which the passage indicates is the bottom layer in the separatory funnel.

25. The correct answer is A. The best IUPAC name for compound 2 is 2 -amino3-methylbutanenitrile. The nitrile is the higher order functional group, relegating the amine functionality to substituent status. Therefore, the main chain is a butanenitrile (shown in blue). Note that the nitrile carbon is $\mathrm{Cl}$ (this is easy to overlook). Attached to the main chain are an amino group at C2 and a methyl group at C3.

No passage 26. The correct answer is C. This problem can be solved by substituting the results of each scenario into Poiseuille's law and searching for the largest value. Choice A yields an $8 \times$ increase in flow. Choice B results in a $1 / 32 \times$ increase in flow. Choice C yields a $32 \times$ increase in flow while choice D results in a $1 / 8 \times$ increase in flow.

27. The correct answer is A. By definition of the two types of lenses, a concave lens increases the focal length of an image while a convex lens reduces the focal length of an image. Therefore, choices B and C are incorrect and can be immediately excluded. Since myopia results in image formation in front of the retina, the appropriate corrective lens would be a concave lens, which increases the focal length of the image, causing the image to focus past this point and on the retina. Choice A is the correct response. Choice D represents the corrective approach for hyperopia or farsightedness.

28. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The problem can be solved using the radioactive decay equation:

$$
A=A_{o} e^{-\left(\frac{(0.693}{T_{1 / 2}}\right) t}
$$

where $A$ is the final radionuclide activity measured at some time, $t ; A_{o}$ is the initial radionuclide activity; $T_{1 / 2}$ is the radionuclide half-life; and $t$ is the radioactive decay time. Adapting the given information to this equation, $A$ is the unknown, $A_{o}=28 \mathrm{mCi}, T_{1 / 2}=5.25 d=453,600 \mathrm{~s}$, and $t=7 d=604,800 \mathrm{~s}$, which yields the following calculation:

$$
A=(28 \mathrm{mCi})(0.397)=11.1 \mathrm{mCi}
$$

29. The correct answer is C. Calcium carbonate (marble/chalk) is insoluble in water and will produce the least amount of ions to spread out in solution. This is different from the other three, which are soluble and will have ions spread out in solution. Calcium carbonate will be soluble in acid, however, which is why acid rain can erode marble statues.

30. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Unknown $\mathrm{C}$ is soluble in water, which eliminates the calcium carbonate. Unknown $\mathrm{C}$ also forms a precipitate with $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. This will happen when magnesium sulfate reacts with ammonia according to the reaction:

$$
2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(a q)+\mathrm{MgSO}_{4}(a q) \rightarrow \mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(s)+\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}(a q)
$$

31. The correct answer is B. Unknown A is soluble in water and has negative results for all of the tests except for conductivity, so it must be $\mathrm{NaCl}$.

32. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The endpoint of a titration should best be matched to the $\mathrm{pK}$ of the indicator. Because a strong base and weak acid titration will have an endpoint in the basic range, phenolphthalein is best-suited for this titration.

33. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. If the $\mathrm{pH}=10$, then the $\mathrm{pOH}$ is 4 because $\mathrm{pH}+\mathrm{pOH}=14$. Given the $\mathrm{pOH}=4$, the $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$is $1 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}$. When the $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ expression is written for magnesium hydroxide, we get $K_{\mathrm{sp}}=\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]^{2}$. This then becomes $K_{\mathrm{sp}}=[x][x]^{2}=[x]^{3} .\left[1 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}\right]^{3}=1 \times 10^{-12}$. This is close to the actual value of $1.6 \times 10^{-12}$.

34. The correct answer is C. You first need to determine a mathematical relationship Passage VI for surface tension, which can be derived from the following equation:

$$
h=\frac{2 T}{\rho g r}
$$

Passage $\mathrm{V}$ Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 2 Rearranging the equation for $T$ and substituting all given information yields:

$$
T=\frac{\rho g r h}{2}=\frac{\left(1,000 \frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{m}^{3}}\right)\left(9.8 \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^{2}}\right)(0.0025 \mathrm{~m})(0.08 \mathrm{~m})}{2}=0.98 \frac{\mathrm{kg}}{\mathrm{s}^{2}} \approx 1.0 \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{m}}
$$

35. The correct answer is A. This problem can be answered by referring to the equation for the height of the dye traveling through capillary action:

$$
h=\frac{2 T}{\rho g r}
$$

Of all of the options presented for consideration, the only one with direct relevance to a variable within the equation is choice A. The weight of the water is reflected by the term $\rho g$, which must be pulled up the stem by the surface tension. The presence of sugar increases the weight of the water to be taken up the stem by capillary action and thus it travels more slowly. At each time interval recorded in the experiment, the dye in beakers 2 and 3 does not travel as high up the stem as the stem placed in beaker 1.

36. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The equation for the line of best fit for the data recorded for beaker 3 is:

$$
y=0.275 x-0.2
$$

which is expressed in the form of the equation for a line:

$$
y=m x+b
$$

where $m$ is the slope of the line. It is the slope that provides the hourly rate of ascension of the dye up the carnation stem. The answer is $0.28$.

37. The correct answer is $C$. The equation for the line of best fit for the data recorded for beaker 1 is:

$$
y=0.945 x+0.26
$$

or

$$
\text { Height of Dye }=0.945 \times(\text { time })+0.26
$$

Substituting the value of 10 hours for time yields:

$$
\text { Height of Dye }=0.945 \times 10 \mathrm{hrs}+0.26=9.71 \mathrm{~cm}
$$

38. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The equation for the line of best fit for the data recorded for beaker 2 is:

$$
y=0.58 x-0.42
$$

or

$$
\text { Height of Dye }=0.58 \times(\text { time })-0.42
$$

Substituting the value of $10 \mathrm{~cm}$ for the height of dye and solving for time yields:

$$
\begin{gathered}
10 \mathrm{~cm}=0.58 \times(\text { time })-0.42 \\
\text { Time }=17.9 \text { hours } \approx 18 \text { hours }
\end{gathered}
$$

39. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The property of $t$-butoxide (versus methoxide) that is the most significant factor in the lower yield of ether is increased steric bulk. While $t$-butoxide does have a higher $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$, this should also make it more nucleophilic. However, engaging in $\mathrm{S}_{N} 2$ reactivity is sterically more demanding than proton abstraction. Therefore, the bulkier $t$-butoxide forms less ether.

40. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The thermodynamic product is defined as the one that is thermodynamically more stable. In this case, the internal alkene would be more stable, since it is disubstituted versus the monosubstituted terminal alkene. In an E2 paradigm (which is generally irreversible), one must assume that the major product formed the fastest. In the case of methoxide, this is the internal alkene. Therefore, the internal alkene is both the kinetic and thermodynamic product (actually, the norm).

41. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The terminal alkene is the kinetic product; the internal alkene is the thermodynamic product. The thermodynamics of the products have not changed; thus, the internal alkene is still the thermodynamic product. However, with $t$-butoxide the terminal alkene forms the fastest; therefore, it is the kinetic product.

42. The correct answer is D. The most reasonable product distribution is $20 \%$ ether; $50 \%$ terminal alkene; $30 \%$ internal alkene. Since the steric bulk of isopropoxide is intermediate between methoxide and $t$-butoxide, it is reasonable to expect the outcome in all cases to be between the bounds of the other two bases. Thus, more ether is formed than with $t$-butoxide, but less than with methoxide. Furthermore, the terminal alkene is still favored, but less strongly than $t$-butoxide.

43. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The most reasonable product distribution is $50 \%$ ether; $50 \%$ terminal alkene; $0 \%$ internal alkene. With 1-chlorohexene, it is mechanistically impossible to access the internal alkene. Therefore, the only viable products are the ether ( $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2$ product) and the terminal alkene (E2 product).

44. The correct answer is B. The wavelength, $\lambda$, of light is related to its frequency, $f$, Passage VIII by the equation:

$$
c=f \lambda
$$

where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum or $3.0 \times 10^{8} \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}$. Solving for the frequency yields:

$$
f=\frac{c}{\lambda}=\frac{3.0 \times 10^{8} \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}}{700 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}}=4.0 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

45. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The speed of light through a medium, $v$, is related to its index of refraction, $n$, by:

$$
n=\frac{c}{v}=\frac{\text { speed of light in vacuum }}{\text { speed of light in medium }}
$$

The index of refraction of the aqueous humor is given in the passage as $n_{\text {aqueous humor }}=1.336$. Answers and Explanations

Passage VII MCAT

Practice Test 2 Substituting into the above equation:

$$
v=\frac{c}{n}=\frac{3.0 \times 10^{8} \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}}{1.336}=2.2 \times 10^{8} \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}}
$$

46. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The speed of light through the medium is related to its index of refraction by the equation:

$$
n=\frac{c}{v} \text { or } v=\frac{c}{n}
$$

So the speed of light is slowest when the index of refraction is the greatest. Of the possible answer choices, the medium with the greatest index of refraction is the lens with $n=1.406$. Thus, the speed of light is the slowest as it passes through the lens of the human eye.

47. The correct answer is D. The angle of refraction is determined by Snell's law of refraction or:

$$
n_{1} \sin \theta_{1}=n_{2} \sin \theta_{2}
$$

From information given in the passage:

$$
n_{1}=n_{\text {air }}=1.000 ; \theta_{1}=\theta_{\mathrm{i}}=28^{\circ} ; \text { and } n_{2}=n_{\text {cornea }}=1.376
$$

Solving for the unknown $\theta_{2}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sin \theta_{2}=\frac{n_{1} \sin \theta_{1}}{n_{2}}=\frac{(1.000) \sin 28^{\circ}}{1.376}=\frac{0.469}{1.376}=0.341 \\
& \theta_{2}=\sin ^{-1}(0.341)=19.9^{\circ} \approx 20^{\circ}

48. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. When light refraction is at its greatest, the refraction angle is the smallest, which occurs when the ratio of $\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}$ is the smallest. Of the four possible combinations, the smallest value for the ratio is given by the air-cornea interface.

Passage IX 49. The correct answer is A. The only true statement is choice A. At the beginning of the reaction, the concentration of the reactants is greatest. This will give the greatest instantaneous rate. Choice $B$ is not correct because, as the reaction nears its end, the rate at that point will be less than the average rate.

50. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. First the change in molarity is needed. Then this is divided by the time interval. The initial rate $=(0.882-0.697) / 60=0.00308 \mathrm{M} / \mathrm{sec}$.

51. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Using the equation $\ln \left([\mathrm{A}]_{0} /[\mathrm{A}]_{\mathrm{t}}\right)=\mathrm{kt}$, substitution gives:

$$
[\ln (.882-.697)] / 60
$$

52. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The half-life is the time it takes for half of the starting material to react. Starting with $0.882 \mathrm{M}$, the first half-life would be at $0.441 \mathrm{M}$, which would take between 180 and $240 \mathrm{sec}$.

53. The correct answer is A. Because the decomposition is first order, the rate $=k$ $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right]$

54. The correct answer is A. A catalyst lowers the energy of activation of a reaction by changing the mechanism of the reaction.

Passage $\mathrm{X}$ 55. The correct answer is D. Compound 1 has a good leaving group (bromide), and it is treated with a very strong, hindered base (LDA). Because LDA is so sterically hindered, any kind of substitution $\left(\mathrm{S}_{N} 1\right.$ or $\left.\mathrm{S}_{N} 2\right)$ is out of the question. Moreover, the generation of a double bond in the product is a tip-off to an elimination reaction. Choosing between an E1 or an E2 reaction, it is important to recognize that $\mathrm{E} 1$ reactions generally occur in systems where a base is either weak or nonexistent. Since LDA is a very strong base ( $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}=36$ ), an $\mathrm{E} 2$ mechanism is the most reasonable choice.

56. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The major conformer in the $(1 S, 4 R)$-isomer lacks the proper orbital alignment. In both isomers, the $t$-butyl group (shown in blue) locks the cyclohexane into the chair conformer that gives the $t$-butyl group the equatorial position. Recall that for E2 elimination to proceed quickly, an antiperiplanar relationship must exist between the leaving group (in this case, bromide) and an adjacent proton, which is dictated by the alignment of the $\sigma^{*}$ orbital of the C-Br bond with the $\sigma$ orbital of the $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bond. The antiperiplanar arrangements are shown below in bold blue. Notice that the $(1 R, 4 R)$-isomer can achieve the necessary antiperiplanar arrangement, whereas the ( $1 \mathrm{~S}, 4 R$ )-isomer cannot (a C-C bond in the ring is antiperiplanar to the bromine).

57. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. Since the dimethyl group at $\mathrm{C} 2$ prevents elimination from the left side, there is only one possible elimination product. Furthermore, since the reaction does not involve the stereochemistry of the $t$-butyl group, the product should be a single enantiomer (the $R$-isomer). Inasmuch as only one enantiomer is present, the product should exhibit optical activity.

$(1 S, 4 R)$-Compound 1 Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 2 58. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Ozonolysis has the net effect of cleaving the double bond and putting two carbonyl groups in its place. Choices A and B differ from choices C and D by the total carbon count. Note that the starting material (compound 2) has 6 carbons in the ring-these 6 carbons will end up as 6 carbons in the chain of the dialdehyde (compound 3). Choices A and B only have 5 chain carbons; therefore, they can be disqualified. The remaining choices $(\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{D})$ differ in the stereochemistry at the $t$-butyl group. Ozonolysis will not affect this stereochemistry, as shown:

59. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Bear in mind that the regiochemistry in hydroboration is driven by sterics alone. In this particular case, there is no clear Markovnikov or anti-Markovnikov product (i.e., both product alcohols are similarly substituted). However, there is a difference in the steric interactions involved in the two approaches of the borane molecule to the double bond. If the boron aligns with the carbon at the 12 o'clock position, there is steric hindrance caused by the dimethyl group, as shown. This interaction is absent when the boron aligns with the carbon at the 2 o'clock position. The hydroxy group ends up at the same position that the boron was added. As for the stereochemistry of the $t$-butyl group, it is unaffected by this chemistry.

\section{Section 3. Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior}

1. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The "swinging bridge" study showed that in conditions

No passage eliciting a stronger adrenaline reaction, participants rated others as more attractive. This result highlights certain environmental factors that can alter the judgment of attractiveness. This phenomenon is called misattribution of arousal.

2. The correct answer is B. Broca's area in the left frontal lobe is responsible for language production in the brain. In this example, the individual understands language (written) but is unable to produce speech. Interestingly, patients can often produce language if they sing, and this is a frequent therapy for individuals with damage to Broca's area.

3. The correct answer is $C$. Though Janey worked hard for her degree and is excited about her career, it is her father who provides a job for her rather than having her interview and receive the position through normal channels. If she received a better job based on her own hard work and better grades, the sociological construct would be meritocracy. A social mobility construct would indicate that she had changed from one socioeconomic status (SES) level to another, but in this instance Janey is maintaining her same SES with a career in the same field as her father. This suggests social reinforcement rather than social mobility. Social stratification indicates that different SES levels exist and does not really apply in this case.

4. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. The door-in-the-face technique is characterized by an outrageous request followed by a second, more reasonable request. In this example, the outrageous request is the offer of overpriced jewelry. The reasonable request is the offer of less expensive jewelry.

5. The correct answer is C. Men are more likely than women to use resource display. Passage I Based on the data shown, men are more likely to engage in resource display as a mate retention strategy.

6. The correct answer is A. Evolutionary psychology would explain that men are more likely to use resource display because women value financial status as a characteristic in a mate. Evolutionary psychology posits that women are more likely to pursue mates who can provide resources for potential offspring because that indicates that their future offspring will be more likely to survive and pass on the women's genes.

7. The correct answer is B. Males select mates based mainly on the youth, attractiveness, and good health of their potential partner. This answer is consistent with males selecting mates that have characteristics indicating higher potential fertility.

8. The correct answer is D. A likely potential follow-up investigation would study the correlation between behavior and the financial status and perceived attractiveness of the mates. This would allow for a comparison of retention strategies used, based on previously identified desirable characteristics in male and female populations. MCAT

Practice Test 2 9. The correct answer is D. Women are more likely to use indirect means of communicating to competitors that their spouses are "taken." Nonverbal possession signals allow communication without the threat of violence, which may damage health, childbearing ability, and physical well-being (all of which are key attractors to men, according to evolutionary theory). In this instance, public displays of affection are used as a signal to competitors, not as a way to make a partner commit.

Passage II 10. The correct answer is D. Amnesics experience impairment for explicit memory tasks but do not experience impairment for implicit memory tasks compared to control participants. The amnesics score significantly lower on the explicit memory tasks. However, there is no significant difference in performance on the implicit memory tasks.

11. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Amnesic participants were significantly worse at explicit memory tasks compared to control participants. Further, they were able to complete the implicit memory task for a novel (newly learned) list of words. This suggests that they are able to encode new information (i.e., learn) but are unable to explicitly recall or retrieve the previously stored information.

12. The correct answer is A. Amnesic patients are able to encode and access semantic memory but are still impaired in their ability to retrieve the encoded information. Amnesic patients are able to perform the implicit memory task, and so are able to encode information. However, they are impaired in their ability to retrieve information unless that information is prompted in the implicit task. Further, it is possible that the patients were able to explicitly recall the experience of learning and form an episodic memory. However, the only answer choice that includes episodic memory can be ruled out because semantic memory is necessary for episodic retrieval in Tulving's model.

13. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The hippocampus has been found to be a critical structure in the storage and retrieval of memories. Patients with damage to the hippocampus have impaired memory formation and retrieval.

14. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Memories are stored in various locations throughout the cerebral cortex through a process called long-term potentiation.

Passage III 15. The correct answer is C. Participants were better able to remember which list familiar melodies were from than novel melodies. List recognition was better for familiar melodies than for novel melodies for both studied lists.

16. The correct answer is A. Episodic memory is characterized by the ability to identify and consciously re-experience an event that occurred in the past. Procedural, semantic, and implicit memory are characterized as memory of an event without a corresponding knowledge of when it occurred.

17. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Semantic memory is characterized by the ability to recall facts but not remember when an event occurred. In this case, the semantic memory provides the knowledge that the melody is known but is unable to isolate when the melody was heard. 

18. The correct answer is A. Long-term potentiation has created long-lasting excitatory circuits for the memory trace. Long-term potentiation is the process by which memories are stored and lasting memories are encoded.

19. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The percentage of familiar melodies correctly ascribed to both list 1 and list 2 would decrease. Participants would be unable to ascribe familiar melodies to either list because they would not have a memory of when they heard each melody.

20. The correct answer is A. The results show a significant increase in acts of Passage IV imitative aggression by children who view a film showing aggression being rewarded.

21. The correct answer is C. Bandura's research showed that children would imitate aggression when they viewed the aggression rewarded. Learning was not directly tested, and children only needed to view the aggression (reward/punishment) conditions.

22. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The offending child in the example is punished for the child's actions because of the initial aggression. This is consistent with the aggressive-model-punished condition of Bandura's study in which the child is initially aggressive and is later punished for his or her actions.

23. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. One major criticism of Bandura's study was that the children were in an artificial environment and displayed aggression toward a toy rather than toward another child (as seen in the film).

24. The correct answer is A. Joey watches a friend play a violent video game in which punching small animals results in more points. In this condition, Joey is watching his friend being rewarded for aggressive behavior.

25. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. According to the regression lines in the two graphs, in a country with an average fertility rate of six children per woman, a girl has approximately a $22 \%$ chance of being enrolled in secondary school and an $80 \%$ chance of living on less than $\$ 2.00$ per day.

26. The correct answer is B. Each living child alters the financial resources available to each family member, and frequent childbirth may increase health problems for the woman, which may impede her ability to be financially productive. A higher number of children leads to fewer financial resources per child because income does not necessarily rise with the birth of each child. Fewer financial resources means fewer educational opportunities, particularly for female children outside of the United States.

27. The correct answer is D. The graphs depict only women's fertility, education, and poverty levels. Men's fertility levels are less well-known. Even in the context of marriage, many of the world's cultures have less strict sexual rules for men, making men's fertility much more difficult to track.

28. The correct answer is B. Attitude shifts within a culture toward acceptance of family planning would be a change in cultural capital. Answers and Explanations MCAT

Practice Test 2 Passage VI

29. The correct answer is $D$. Education increases human capital; therefore, education about family planning services would be an increase in a society's human capital.

30. The correct answer is D. The group at the highest risk is individuals with a schizophrenic identical twin. The data show that the highest incidence rate (60\%) is for identical twins. Children whose parents are both schizophrenic are the group with the next highest risk at $36 \%$.

31. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. The data show a strong genetic link for the incidence rate of schizophrenia. However, in the case of identical twins ( $100 \%$ genetic match), the incidence rate is only $60 \%$. This suggests that additional environmental influences must also be factors in the development of schizophrenia.

32. The correct answer is A. The other answer choices have been associated with schizophrenia in the research literature. Too much GABA (which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter) has not been associated with schizophrenia in the research literature, although too little GABA has been proposed as a possible mechanism.

33. The correct answer is A. The most appropriate follow-up study would be to survey identical twins who grew up apart and those who grew up in the same household. This is the best answer because it would allow you to study individuals who are exact genetic matches with each other and also allow you to compare same-household (similar environments) twins to different-household (different environments) twins.

34. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Because a child's genetic code cannot be changed but environmental factors also play a role in the development of schizophrenia, a child with schizophrenic family members should receive extra environmental support to reduce the likelihood of developing schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is not inevitable based on genetic factors. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is not a real possibility because avoiding all stress is not possible. Antipsychotic medications have serious negative side effects, and treatment guidelines do not recommend that they be started prophylactically for schizophrenia.

Passage VII 35. The correct answer is B. The length of time a person spends in REM sleep per sleep cycle generally increases as the night progresses. Amplitude becomes larger and frequency slows down as deeper levels of sleep are reached. Further, the length of time a person spends in slow-wave sleep decreases as the hours of sleep increase.

36. The correct answer is A. Most vivid dreaming occurs during REM sleep. Dreaming can also occur during other stages, but it is typically not as vivid.

37. The correct answer is $D$. Each sleep cycle is approximately 90 minutes in length. The cycle is characterized by the stages.

38. The correct answer is B. REM sleep and slow-wave sleep are considered to be associated with restorative processes. REM sleep has been found to decrease as one ages and loss of REM sleep has been found to be associated with cognitive dysfunction (particularly memory). The release of growth hormone during slowwave sleep has physiological benefits. 39. The correct answer is D. At 10:30 p.m., Jose had just begun to enter stage 2 sleep, which is a much lighter sleep state than the sleep states represented by the other answers. During stage 2 sleep, Jose is much more likely to be awakened by small noises that would not affect him during slow-wave sleep (choices B and C) or at the onset of REM sleep ( 2 a.m.). While the end of REM sleep can result in easier arousal from sleep, the onset of REM sleep is associated with more difficult sleep arousal.

40. The correct answer is D. Sound level decreased for participants in actual groups and for participants in pseudogroups. The data show that as the number of people in actual groups increased and the number of (supposed) people in pseudogroups increased, the sound level decreased.

41. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The decibel level would decrease if the people in pseudogroups believed that there were more people in their groups.

42. The correct answer is A. Loss of coordination is characterized by a decrease in productivity due to role/work overlap. The actual groups and the pseudogroups are both affected by social loafing. This is because the actual groups and pseudogroups both believe that there are others working with them. However, only the actual group is affected by loss of coordination. This difference is explained by the lack of a feedback loop, which would indicate the work overlap in the pseudogroups (who are only told there are others working with them) compared to the actual groups (who receive feedback from other group members present).

43. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The difference between the potential productivity and the pseudogroups' productivity can best be explained by social loafing because the difference is the result of believed group size. The pseudogroup participants are not aware of any actual participation by any other person. So loss of coordination does not have any impact on pseudogroup results.

44. The correct answer is A. The greater the number of people working together to complete a task, the more likely it is that social loafing will occur due to a diffusion of responsibility, resulting in decreased effort.

45. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This statement is consistent with the results in the figure and shows that increases in shallow acting are likely to result in increases in stress.

46. The correct answer is C. In the dramaturgical approach, an individual is always playing some type of role in all social interactions. Based on the research shown, deep acting will result in less stress.

47. The correct answer is B. Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that if you change your beliefs, acting becomes less stressful. The theory states that in low-reward situations, it is less stressful for you to alter your beliefs to match existing situations. In this example, customer-service workers engaged in shallow acting (e.g., changing facial expressions, smiling at customers) and deep acting (e.g., detailing the benefits of a product, etc.) in order to interact with customers. Because there is little direct reward for showing enthusiasm and engaging customers, more stress will result with shallow acting in which inner beliefs are not changed. Conversely, for deep acting, cognitive dissonance would result in a shift in inner beliefs to Answers and Explanations Passage VIII

48. The correct answer is A. Self-verification involves making sure that a person chooses the "audience" that verifies his or her self-view and thus reinforces that person's self-identity.

49. The correct answer is A. According to the dramaturgical approach, individuals are truly themselves only when they are alone (offstage). Onstage behavior is characterized by acting, and backstage behavior is still influenced by goal-directed behavior for the audience.

Passage $\mathrm{X}$ 50. The correct answer is B. High-social-contact participants under high stress are more likely to become sick than low-social-contact participants.

51. The correct answer is $D$. Both positive events and negative events increase stress. The more social contacts, the more likely that a person will be exposed to a cold or flu, and the higher the stress, the more likely the individual will become sick.

52. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. Taking steps to master, tolerate, or reduce stress is referred to as coping.

53. The correct answer is B. Light exercise such as taking a morning run is a positive coping mechanism and will likely reduce stress.

54. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The fight-or-flight response is characterized by the activation of the autonomic nervous system.

No Passage 55. The correct answer is B. Symbolic interactionism, proposed by social psychologist George Mead, proposes that an individual's identity is defined by symbols representative of a society. One example of such a symbol is the traditional white dress of a bride. Sue expected Betsy, a future bride, to have chosen a white wedding dress, aligned with the norms and expectations of Sue's social interactions.

56. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The stage of sleep that is the most beneficial to the body system is the third stage of sleep often referred to as slow wave sleep. During this stage of sleep, the greatest release of growth hormone, most effective wound healing and most active immune responses occur.

57. The correct answer is A. The thymus gland plays a critical role in the immune system. The pituitary gland is located in the hypothalamus and releases hormones, among them growth hormones. The pineal gland is involved in the release of melatonin and assisting with the circadian rhythms of the body. The thyroid gland controls energy use, protein production, body sensitivity to other hormones.

58. The correct answer is D. Wernicke's area, the region of the brain responsible for the understanding of language is found in the left temporal lobe of the brain.

59. The correct answer is B. Cultural capital involves the world outlook and beliefs that are passed on from parents to children. The fact that the immigrants saw the conditions that they were in would not translate into a successful life for their children and made a choice to improve the likelihood of success is an example of cultural capital. 

\section{Section 4. Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills}

1. The correct answer is C. Skim the passage to locate mention of three out of four assertions. The underground system (choice A) appears in paragraph 4, purple Passage I loosestrife's effect on fish appears in paragraph 6, and its use in American gardens (choice D) appears in paragraph 2. Paragraph 7 says that it is "impervious to burning," making choice $\mathrm{C}$ the best answer.

2. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question indirectly asks you to locate an author's reasons for including a detail. Returning to the passage will help you see that the mention of the St. Lawrence River refers to a type of wetland where purple loosestrife does well. The only answer supported by the text is choice B.

3. The correct answer is C. All three details are facts about purple loosestrife, but only its ability to cross-pollinate (I) and its easy adaptability (II) are facts that "add to its power of endurance." Since both I and II are correct, the answer is choice C.

4. The correct answer is C. The answer appears in paragraph 3 : "The same long growing season that makes it so beloved by gardeners makes it a seed-making machine." It is the long growing season (choice C) that gardeners like.

5. The correct answer is D. You must infer the answer based on what you have learned about purple loosestrife from the passage. Because it thrives in wetlands and along rivers, either II or III is likely. Although I might in theory be possible, the author does point out, "It has moved steadily westward and is now found in all states but Florida." Since that eliminates I as a choice, the answer must be choice D.

6. The correct answer is B. Your choice must weaken the argument that purple loosestrife is best eradicated by digging it up, plowing it under, and reseeding. Choice A would suggest another means of eradication but would not weaken the original argument. Choices $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ do not weaken or strengthen the argument, although both may suggest benefits of the eradication plan. Only choice B throws a monkey wrench in the works: If a new strain of purple loosestrife is growing up where it was once eliminated, then this form of eradication does not really work.

7. The correct answer is C. Native American and Chinese drums are mentioned in

Passage II the first paragraph as examples of drums that accompany soldiers into battle.

8. The correct answer is D. A Janissary stop is described as being added to organs and harpsichords, which have a series of stops, or knobs, that adjust tones and add special effects. The only answer that fits the context is choice D.

9. The correct answer is C. Haydn and Mozart enter the discussion as examples of classical composers who adopted the forms and characteristics of martial music. This does not mean that Janissary music came from Europe (choice B), and since Haydn and Mozart are musicians, not painters, choice D does not apply.

10. The correct answer is C. Skim the passage to find whether examples are given to support each assertion. Looking first at assertion I, you can see that the author MCAT

Practice Test 2 mentions the "Jingling Johnny" as an example of unusual percussion. Since I is a yes, you can immediately eliminate answer choices B and D. The only question remaining is whether the answer is choice A or C, so you must look for examples to support assertion III. The first sentence in paragraph 4 mentions “The Stars and Stripes Forever" as an example of Sousa's beloved marches. Since I and III are both yes responses, your answer must be choice $C$.

11. The correct answer is A. This is a "what-if?" question: What if the author included this particular piece of information? The fact that it refers to the 18th century means that it has no relation to the Civil War (choice C), and the use of drums preceded Janissary music (choice D). The best answer is choice A; it would help support the idea that martial music was a key part of the military at that time.

12. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. The author compares the Pentagon's expenditure on music to the government's comparatively paltry expenditure on $\mathrm{K}-12$ music education. Although the information is fascinating (choice A), the shock value involved in the comparison makes it most likely to have been included as a critical remark.

Passage III 13. The correct answer is C. Since the whole passage is about military adventures, you should be able to select choice $\mathrm{C}$ as the most likely answer without reviewing the passage. The proof is in paragraph 5 , where the author refers to "the final campaigns of the Zulu War."

14. The correct answer is B. Although Rorke's Drift was a British success story (choice C), the author makes clear that it was a minor success at best and tells how Chelmsford used it to cover up a huge British failure at Isandhlwana.

15. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. The author does not seem to think much of the tactics of Frere (choice C), and Wolseley (choice D) is mentioned only in terms of his success after taking over for Chelmsford. In the author's narrative, Chelmsford tried to seize Zululand, but his invasion force was massacred and he was eventually recalled to England. Despite his self-serving propaganda, Chelmsford clearly failed to accomplish his purpose. The best answer is choice A.

16. The correct answer is D. King Cetshwayo (choice C) ruled Zululand before he fought the British. After the kingdom was subdivided, a white African mercenary (choice A) ruled one part of it. Later, Dinizulu (choice B) wrested the kingdom from his own brother and ruled briefly. Chelmsford (choice D) never ruled at all.

17. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. Your choice must specifically point to a British failure to understand the African culture. Chelmsford's cover-up (I) had nothing to do with the Africans. The three-column advance (II) may have been a tactical error, but it cannot be blamed on a failure to understand Africans. The failure of partition (III), however, indicates that the British did not recognize the divisions among tribal leaders and peoples. Since only III is a yes, the answer is choice C.

18. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. To answer this question, you must think about the purpose and aim of the Zulu War. It was not a peasant uprising (choice A) or a war to eradicate a people (choice B); it was a war designed to topple a leader so as to form a union imposed from outside the region. In that way, it most resembles modern-day Iraq (choice D).

19. The correct answer is D. Hunting and habitat destruction are the only reasons mentioned for the depopulation of elk prior to the 20th century.

20. The correct answer is D. According to the passage, in 1913, 50 elk were moved from Yellowstone to Pennsylvania. Two years later, 95 more were moved. The total shipped in those years comes to 145 .

21. The correct answer is D. "At present," says the passage, "new herds are established in Arkansas, Kentucky, Michigan, and Wisconsin in addition to Pennsylvania." There is talk of moving herds to Tennessee (choiceA) and the Adirondacks (choice C) in the future. Georgia (choice B) is mentioned only as the original southernmost range of eastern elk; it is not a place where they might be seen today.

22. The correct answer is C. A list of states accompanies assertion I, and a list of animal species accompanies assertion II. Since both I and II are supported by examples, the answer is choice C.

23. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. As the passage states clearly, "All of the eastern subspecies are now extinct." The reintroduced subspecies is the western subspecies, the one found in Yellowstone. It is a different subspecies from the original Pennsylvania elk.

24. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Your answer must directly support the contention that elk repopulation is carefully monitored. Choices A and C have nothing to do with repopulation; they deal with animals in confined conditions. Choice B deals with wild elk but not with monitoring of the population. Choice D shows an example of monitoring that is taking place today.

25. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. The claim is that elk reintroduction benefits other species. Your answer must contradict this contention. Choice A shows a clear benefit to other populations, so it does not contradict the claim. Choice B shows a change in a species that does not live where elk live. Choice D does not refer to other species at all. Only choice $\mathrm{C}$ indicates a possible problem; the fact that deer are migrating northward may mean that elk are encroaching on their habitats.

26. The correct answer is A. Spooner was known for his transpositions, of which "You have deliberately tasted two worms" (wasted two terms) is an example. Although transposition has a variety of possible meanings, here it refers specifically to the exchange of letters or word parts.

27. The correct answer is C. The final paragraph discusses two forms of metathesis that derive from the butchers' trade. One is louchébem (II), and the other is rechtub klat. Since only II is correct, the answer is choice C.

28. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. Verlan and other backslang (I) are word games and therefore purposeful, not accidental. The examples of accidental metathesis include the change between Latin originals and Spanish derivatives (II) and mispronunciations or skewed pronunciations of English words (III). Since II and III are correct, the answer is choice D. Answers and Explanations

Practice Test 2 29. The correct answer is D. Although the origin of Pig Latin appears to be unknown, the author refers to its use in the prisoner-of-war camps of World War II and Vietnam. The implication is that it was used to communicate between prisoners in a language their captors could not understand.

30. The correct answer is C. If most Spoonerisms are apocryphal, or fictional, that would not be proved by a list of attributed transpositions (choice A), which would simply seem to support their authenticity. Examples of modern-day transpositions (choice B) would do nothing to support or deny the authenticity of Spoonerisms, and Spooner's letters (choice D) would not help because his transpositions, if they existed, were oral, not written. Interviews with people who knew Spooner (choice C) would be the best way to settle the issue one way or the other.

31. The correct answer is B. Saying cause instead of because (III) is an example of aphaeresis, the loss of the initial part of a word. The other two examples show transpositions of phonemes that are accidental. Since I and II are correct, the answer is choice B.

32. The correct answer is B. Verlan transposes the phonemes in syllables, often changing the spelling to match the revised word construction. Since critique is pronounced /krih-teek/, reversing those phonemes would give you a word pronounced /teek-krih/. The most likely spelling for this is shown in choice B.

33. The correct answer is C. Compare what you know about Pig Latin to what you know about metathesis. Pig Latin, like other metathesis, does transpose phonemes, so choice A is incorrect. Metathesis may be accidental or purposeful, so choice B is incorrect. There is no indication that the definition of metathesis includes the rule that such words must add to the language, so choice D does not work. Pig Latin involves more than the reversal of phonemes that marks metathesis; it also involves the addition of the "ay" syllable. The best answer is choice C.

Passage VI 34. The correct answer is C. This question involves your understanding of supporting details and evidence. The answer is found at the beginning of the passage, where the author details the three conceptions of totality. Here, the author states that the first two views are "contrasting" and that the third view is "not simply ... the sum of its parts as atomists believe or ... something independent of its parts." Thus, all three views are incompatible with each other, and choice $\mathrm{C}$ is the correct answer. There is no evidence that the views have evolved from each other (choice A). The materialist view is one of the conceptions of totality, and it has helped philosophers grasp connections, so choice B cannot be correct. Be careful of choice D; the passage states that philosophers "recognize" three different views, but that doesn't mean there are only three views.

35. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. This question asks you to assess evidence. What supporting evidence does the author give to back the claim that this view is "challenging"? The answer lies at the end of the third paragraph, where the author states that the high number of connections and relationships make the view "overwhelming" to even the brightest philosophers. This idea is what choice B expresses. It is not clear from the passage how many philosophers espouse this view (choice A), and the author doesn't say whether that makes the viewpoint challenging. Choice C is wrong because the author says the number of things a philosopher must consider is overwhelming, not the insights. The author says that Marxist philosophers use abstraction (choice D) but never states that it is necessary to the dialectical viewpoint.

36. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. This question depends on your ability to analyze an argument. The author uses the chair in the third paragraph as part of his discussion on the critics' objections to a dialectical conception of totality. This is precisely what choice A states. The author has not yet discussed abstraction (choice B) or capitalism (choice C). Choice D is too strong; the author doesn't say dialectical thinking is impossible, just difficult.

37. The correct answer is B. In order to answer this question you need to distinguish among fact, opinion, and unsupported assertions. Look in the passage for the author's opinion or belief about the dialectical materialist viewpoint. At no point does the author indicate it leads to superior insights (choice A). Critics of the view state that it is impractical to use, but the author doesn't state that is what $h e$ believes (choice C). And there is no indication that the author thinks it's best used for the study of institutions (choice D). That leaves choice B, which is supported when the author writes that criticisms of dialectical materialism are "somewhat justified." This gives an indication of the author's belief about his subject matter.

38. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question asks you to draw conclusions. Using the information in the passage, you must conclude which answer choice reflects a process of abstraction. The author states that abstraction allows the investigator to "draw boundaries" around an object or idea studied. One possible abstraction involves "time scale." In choice C, the philosopher puts a temporal boundary around the idea studied. Choices A and B are examples of dialectical thinking but not abstractions. Choice D simply indicates a philosopher is aware of his or her biases, but there are no abstractions made.

39. The correct answer is D. To answer this question you'll need to look for the main idea. Choice A is not correct because the author does not say that the dialectical viewpoint is better than the other two. Choice $\mathrm{B}$ is mentioned as a criticism of the dialectical viewpoint, but it is not the primary focus of the passage. Marx's view of capitalism (choice C) is mentioned merely in passing and is not the main point of the passage. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is correct because the author describes a viewpoint, details an objection to it, and then discusses how that objection may be overcome. Answers and Explanations MCAT

Passage VII 40. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question requires you to find the main idea. The passage discusses living fossils, a term biologists use to designate a species that has changed little since its inception. It then provides details on four different living fossils. Choice D is the best description of the passage. The passage doesn't primarily explain how these species remain unchanged as choice A states. Nor does it detail a dilemma (choice B) or focus mainly on the coelacanth (choice C).

41. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. In order to answer this question, you must choose an accurate paraphrase of the information in the passage. The first paragraph states that living fossils are not primitive. Rather they are so well-adapted to their environment that there is little need for change. Thinking that evolution necessarily represents advancement is indeed a misunderstanding, as choice B indicates. Choice A is not what the passage states as there is no comparison to other species. Choice C may be true, but it doesn't answer the question. Choice D is not stated in the passage.

42. The correct answer is C. This question asks you to solve a problem. Here, you need to use information from the passage to put the time periods in the correct order. The discussion of the horseshoe crab indicates that the Jurassic period is the most recent, some 200 million years ago. The Permian period, at which time the lungfish ceased experiencing major evolutionary changes, was about 250 million years ago. And the Silurian period, from which the coelacanth emerged, was more than 400 million years ago. That makes choice $\mathrm{C}$ the correct answer.

43. The correct answer is A. You need to analyze an argument in order to answer this question. In the context of the passage, in which the majority of the information explains that living fossils have changed very little, why would the author include a part about rapid evolutionary change? The answer is to show that a living fossil does change and evolve; however, the changes are minor or cease at some point. Choice A is the best answer.

44. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. This question requires you to draw conclusions. The author does not state choice A explicitly, but does say that the discovery was aided by an "astounding coincidence." The passage indicates that biologists find the lungfish interesting, but that does not necessarily imply the author believes the same as choice B says. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is not a valid conclusion based on the passage. The author indicates that the discovery of the coelacanth was a major surprise, but that doesn't mean that biologists were wrong to believe it was extinct. There is no evidence to support choice D.

45. The correct answer is $\mathrm{D}$. This question asks you to compare and contrast information found in the passage. We know from the second paragraph that the horseshoe crab is the most recent living fossil at 200 million years old. The other three all date from around 400 million years ago. The final paragraph says that at that time, land-dwelling plants were just beginning to evolve. Thus, choice D is the best answer because the land-dwelling plants had been evolving for about 200 million years by the time the horseshoe crab appeared on the scene. Choices A and B indicate aspects the crab shares with some of the other living fossils. There is no evidence of choice C.

46. The correct answer is A. This question tests your ability to analyze an argument. The last paragraph continually emphasizes how the discovery of the coelacanth was an amazing event. The author uses words like singular, astounding, and surprising. This corresponds to choice $\mathrm{A}$. There is no evidence for choice $\mathrm{B}$ or $\mathrm{D}$, and the paragraph does not make it clear that it was the public who reacted with the allegations as choice $\mathrm{C}$ indicates.

47. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. To answer this question, you must apply new evidence. According to the passage, a living fossil is one that has changed very little over the eons. In order to argue that the coelacanth is not a living fossil, a biologist would need to find evidence of significant change. Showing that the coelacanth actually comes from a different line, as choice $\mathrm{C}$ does, would do so. The age of the species is not the issue, as choices A and D indicate. And finding different species, as in choice B, would not affect the status of the coelacanth as a living fossil.

48. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question asks you to choose an accurate paraphrase. The first paragraph explains what puzzles political scientists, so look back at it and try to put the information into your own words. The author states that commonsense explanations of what motivates voters are generally correct, so choice $\mathrm{A}$ is wrong. The problem lies instead with why people expend the time and energy to vote when they could reap the benefits without voting and when it is unlikely that their votes will have an impact as choice $\mathrm{C}$, the best answer, states.

49. The correct answer is $\mathrm{B}$. You must draw a conclusion to answer this question. The thought expressed in the final sentence of the first paragraph is most similar to what a free rider would believe; namely, a free rider wants to enjoy the benefits of something without incurring the costs. So the best answer is choice B.

50. The correct answer is $\mathrm{A}$. To answer this question, you must make a generalization. The passage states that those individuals with more resources are more likely to vote. Of the answers, choice A is best. Lawyers have high levels of education and tend to make a fair amount of money. Choice D might be tempting, but it isn't clear what the education level of the homemaker is, making choice A better. Also, the passage states that Switzerland and the United States have low voter turnout numbers, which eliminates choices B and C.

51. The correct answer is $\mathrm{C}$. This question requires you to analyze an argument. Looking back at the passage, the author identifies three main explanatory factors: resources, mobilization, and instrumental motivation. Assertion I is incorrect because the passage does not state a person needs "large amounts" of free time; a person simply needs enough time to vote. Assertion II would correspond to a Answers and Explanations Passage VIII 52. The correct answer is $\mathbf{A}$. This is a fairly straightforward question that asks about supporting details. In the final paragraph, the author states that the baseline model "achieves some success ... but is useless" when trying to compare voting behavior among citizens of different countries. Of the answers, choice A best states this. Choice B is wrong because it is too general. As the passage states, the model only works in certain cases. There is no evidence to support choice $\mathrm{C}$ or $\mathrm{D}$.

53. The correct answer is D. A question that asks what the passage implies is asking you to draw conclusions. The correct answer will not be directly stated, so you'll have to look at what inference you can draw from the given information. Choice A cannot be inferred. The passage states that the theory of baseline political participation holds that resources are the key factor, but this theory is shown to be deficient. Choice B is also incorrect. The author states that resources have received the "most scholarly attention," but that doesn't mean the other two factors have been ignored. There is no support for choice $\mathrm{C}$ either, since the author only addresses one theory that has been found lacking. That leaves choice $\mathrm{D}$, the correct answer. The author states that resources have received the most attention, so that implies mobilization has received less attention.
