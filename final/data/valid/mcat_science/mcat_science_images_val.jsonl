The blood-testis barrier is described in the passage as a barricade to establish immune privilege for the testes.

Sperm cells are haploid, and all are genetically different from each other and from other cells in the body. Because they are genetically different, they should express unique surface antigens. If the cells of the immune system were to contact the sperm, they would be perceived as foreign and could be subject to immune system attack, which would destroy the sperm. For this reason, the blood-testis barrier is required to keep the sperm away from the immune cells. The remaining choices do not make good sense. Sperm cells will eventually leave the reproductive system during ejaculation. It also would not make sense to indicate that the blood flow to the testes needs to be cut off.

Sex-linked inheritance can be quickly eliminated as males and females seem to be equally affected based on the pedigree. Since autosomal inheritance is obvious, it is necessary to determine if the pattern is characteristic of a dominant or recessive condition. Recessive traits are notorious for \"skipping generations\" in pedigrees, which means that affected children often come from unaffected parents. To be affected, the individual must be homozygous recessive. The parents do not have the disease, but they are unknowing carriers (heterozygotes), which gives them a $25 \\%$ chance of having an affected offspring. In dominant autosomal inheritance, the affected individual can be homozygous dominant or heterozygous. This means that in order for a child to have the disease, the child must have inherited at least one mutated allele from his or her parent who also had the disease. The only exception would be if spontaneous mutation occurred. When affected individuals appear in each generation of a pedigree, dominance should be suspected.", "Final Answer": "D", "Images": ["2_0_7_0.jpg"], "Problem Type": "Multiple choice"}

The passage explains that individuals who developed tuberous sclerosis as the result of gonadal mosaicism come from parents who do not have the mutated TSC1 and TSC2 alleles in their somatic cells. Since we already determined that the pattern of inheritance for this condition is autosomal dominant, we know that the affected individual only needs to receive a mutated version of TSC1 or TSC2 from one parent. Since individuals inherit their alleles through the egg and sperm of their parents, it is reasonable to expect that the gonadal mosaicism form of tuberous sclerosis must come from a mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene on one of the parent's gametes.

To answer this question, you need to rely on your knowledge of genetics. The passage states that the delta-32 CCR5 mutation is protective against HIV infection. The question indicated that there are two different phenotypes noted within the delta-32 CCR5 mutation-one that offers near 100 percent protection against HIV infection and one that offers only partial protection. The best explanation for why two phenotypes (complete protection and partial protection) are observed would be that the delta-32 allele exhibits incomplete dominance. An individual that is homozygous for the allele (meaning he or she inherited two copies of the delta-32 allele) would have full protection, while an individual who is heterozygous (meaning he or she has one normal copy of the allele and one copy of the delta-32 allele) would have an intermediate phenotype (being partial protection). This is indicated by choice B. Since the question indicates that the differences in phenotype (protection) are related to the delta32 mutation, choices A and D can be eliminated as they suppose that something other than the allele is providing protection.
