The spacesuit was designed to collect and transmit important monitoring, communications, and tracking information throughout the jump. Baumgartner then ascended to the jumping altitude housed within a pressurized capsule of weight 2900 lbs ( $12900 \\mathrm{~N})$ attached to a $30 \\times 10^{6}$ cubic feet $\\left(8.5 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~L}\\right)$ helium-filled weather balloon.

The forgetting curve has been studied in a variety of different environments and for a variety of different stimuli.\nOn day 1 of a memory research study, participants were asked to learn a list of items. Researchers then tracked the proportion of the list that the participants remembered as time passed. On day 2 , some participants were asked to relearn the list. Again, the proportion remembered was tracked over time. On day 3 , some participants were asked to relearn the list a second time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time. On day 4, some participants were asked to relearn the list a third time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time.\nThe data from this study produced the following set of forgetting curves. Each line represents the memory of the learned or relearned list.

Endothelin is capable of binding to two different receptors. There are receptors for endothelin located on smooth muscle (ETA) and receptors for endothelin located on vascular endothelium (ETB). When endothelin binds to ETA, it initiates vasoconstriction by narrowing blood vessels. However, when endothelin binds to ETB, vasodilation occurs due to the widening of blood vessels.

To answer this question, Answers and Explanations Passage III MCAT\nyou need to think about how the sperm cells in the testes would compare to other cells in the body. Sperm cells are haploid, and all are genetically different from each other and from other cells in the body. Because they are genetically different, they should express unique surface antigens. If the cells of the immune system were to contact the sperm, they would be perceived as foreign and could be subject to immune system attack, which would destroy the sperm. For this reason, the blood-testis barrier is required to keep the sperm away from the immune cells. The remaining choices do not make good sense. Sperm cells will eventually leave the reproductive system during ejaculation. It also would not make sense to indicate that the blood flow to the testes needs to be cut off.
