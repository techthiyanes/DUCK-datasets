{"Problem Number": "1_0_3", "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "\nLeukemia is a term that describes a wide variety of blood cell cancers. Most leukemia cases involve elevated leukocyte counts. In acute cases of leukemia, immature leukocytes proliferate quickly, which leads to many abnormal immature cells in the bone marrow. This inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce healthy new leukocytes. This form of the cancer progresses rapidly, and the cells metastasize easily as they move into the bloodstream from the bone marrow. It can be fatal within weeks or months if not treated promptly. In contrast, chronic cases of leukemia typically involve the proliferation of abnormal mature leukocytes. This form of the disease progresses more slowly, and treatment need not always be immediate.\nOnce classified as acute or chronic, leukemia can be further subdivided into lymphocytic or myelogenous. This distinction depends on which type of leukocyte is abnormal in the patient. In lymphocytic leukemia, the lymphoid cells, such as the lymphocytes, are abnormal. In the myelogenous form, the myeloid cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils, are affected.\nChemotherapy drugs are often used in the management of leukemia cases. There are numerous categories of these drugs, and they have varied mechanisms of action. In treatment, several drugs are used in combination because some of the drugs are cell-cycle specific while others are not. Alkylating agents are capable of disrupting the function of DNA. Tubulin-binding agents are designed to interfere with microtubule formation. Other drugs are designed to interfere with DNA polymerase, DNA repair mechanisms, or protein synthesis, or to act as purine analogs. Many of these drugs cannot enter into the brain when injected or ingested, so if the cancer has spread to\nthis area, special methods must be used to introduce the drugs to the brain.\nA variety of risk factors exist for leukemia. Some of these factors include exposure to radiation, certain viral infections, and inherited tendencies. What do all of these factors have in common?", "Answer Candidates": ["All involve problems with protein translation in the cells.", "All can cause an increase in the production of cellular growth factors that enhance cell proliferation.", "All cause changes to the DNA that can lead to the production of altered proteins that can influence the development of cancer.", "All cause problems with transcription in the cells."], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{C}$. Of the items listed in the question, the thing they all have in common is that they are mutagens or involve some genetic change. These mutations to the DNA can lead to the production of altered proteins that can be associated with cancer. While some cancers are associated with changes in cellular growth factors, this would not be the case for all cancers. The translation of proteins is directly from the mRNA, which is derived from the DNA in transcription. There would have to be a change in the DNA for the translation of proteins to be affected.", "Final Answer": "C", "Images": [], "Problem Type": "Multiple choice"}

Blood is carried via the pulmonary arteries to the lungs where gas exchange occurs. After gas exchange occurs, oxygenated blood returns to the heart via pulmonary veins to enter the left atrium. From there blood passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle. Blood leaves the left side of the heart by passing through the aortic valve into the aorta.

In an adult, the kidneys are typically capable of processing about 1 to $1.5$ liters of water per hour depending on the individual and conditions within the body. In a condition known as water intoxication, a person ingests more water (usually 3 or more liters in a single sitting) in a shorter period of time than the kidneys can process. In a child, the amount of water required to induce water intoxication is much less.", "Answer Candidates": ["administering a saline solution that is more concentrated than the cells", "administering an isotonic solution", "administering a solution low in solute concentration", "performing dialysis to remove excess water from the plasma"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{A}$. In this case, administering a solution that is hypertonic to the cells would help. A hypertonic extracellular solution would draw water out of the swollen cells to counteract the effects of water intoxication. An isotonic solution would not help. A solution low in solute concentration would be high in water relative to the cells making the solution hypotonic, which would cause more water to enter the cells. A saline solution would be high in solutes and hypertonic to the cells.", "Final Answer": "A", "Images": [], "Problem Type": "Multiple choice"}
{"Problem Number": "1_2_2", "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "With which theoretical paradigm is the German political philosopher Karl Marx MOST associated?", "Answer Candidates": ["conflict theory", "functionalism", "symbolic interactionism", "avoidance theory"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is A. Conflict theory states that society is fundamentally in conflict when there is an uneven distribution of resources, and that power struggles between groups of people create divisiveness across gender, race, and socioeconomic status.", "Final Answer": "A", "Images": [], "Problem Type": "Multiple choice"}
{"Problem Number": "1_2_3", "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Problem Statement": "According to the bystander effect, which is MOST likely to be true in an emergency?", "Answer Candidates": ["the greater the number of people present, the slower the response because of increased diffusion of responsibility", "the greater the number of people present, the slower the response because of decreased diffusion of responsibility", "the greater the number of people present, the faster the response because of increased diffusion of responsibility", "the greater the number of people present, the faster the response because of decreased diffusion of responsibility"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is A. The bystander effect is characterized by slowness in response due to diffusion of responsibility. The more people who are present, the less an individual is likely to feel responsible to respond to the emergency because of the collective presence of other individuals.", "Final Answer": "A", "Images": [], "Problem Type": "Multiple choice"}
