{"Topic": "", "Book": "", "Problem Statement": "Let $M$ be a connected closed 4-manifold such that $\\pi_{1}(M)$ is perfect; that is, does not have any non-trivial abelian quotients. Determine the possible cohomology groups $H^{*}(M, \\mathbb{Z})$.", "Answer Candidates": [], "Images": [], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "We first claim that $M$ is orientable. Let $p: \\widetilde{M} \\rightarrow M$ be the orientation cover of $M$. As $M$ is connected, this is completely classified as a covering by any fibre $p^{-1}(m)$ together with the action of $\\pi_{1}(M, m)$.  As the orientation covering is 2-fold, this is the same as a homomorphism $\\pi_{1}(M, m) \\rightarrow \\Sigma_{2} \\simeq \\mathbb{Z} / 2$. It this was non-trivial, then it would be surjective, which is impossible since $\\pi_{1}(M)$ is assumed to be perfect. Thus, we deduce that the orientation covering is the trivial 2 -fold covering, so that $M$ is orientable.  We will now determine the possible homology groups. Orientability tells us that $H^{4}(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\simeq \\mathbb{Z}$ and similarly $H_{4}(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\simeq \\mathbb{Z}$.  By Hurewicz theorem, we have $H_{1}(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\simeq \\pi_{1}(M)^{a b}$. By the perfectness assumption, the latter vanishes, and hence so does the former.  By universal coefficient theorem combined with vanishing of $H_{1}$, we deduce that $$H^{2}(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\simeq \\operatorname{Hom}\\left(H_{2}(M, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}\\right) .$$  The latter group is torsion-free, and we deduce that $H^{2}(M, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a torsion free abelian group, hence finite free rank as $M$ is compact. The Poincare duality isomorphism $H_{2}(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\simeq H^{2}(M, \\mathbb{Z})$ allows us to deduce that the second homology group is also free of finite rank.  Similarly, we have Poincare isomorphism $H_{3}(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\simeq H^{1}(M, \\mathbb{Z})$ and a universal coefficient isomorphism $H^{1}(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\simeq \\operatorname{Hom}\\left(H_{1}(M, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}\\right)$. The last group vanishes, and we deduce the same is true for the third homology groups. These shows that the possible homology groups of $M$ are respectively $$\\mathbb{Z}, 0, A, 0, \\mathbb{Z}$$ where $A$ is free of finite rank.
