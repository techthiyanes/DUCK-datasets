Second, scientists are most likely to find undiscovered or rediscovered species in remote, isolated areas. Cultivated areas are inhospitable to many animals.

Like many wars of the 19th century, it was declared not by Parliament but rather by people on the scene. Sir Henry Bartle Frere was an emissary of the Queen, sent to Cape Town to find a way to unify the British and Boer colonies with a variety of independent black states to form a Confederation of South Africa. Standing in his way was the Zulu Army, a robust contingent of 40,000 warriors under the leadership of King Cetshwayo.\nFrere looked for a way to seize Zululand. He used a series of minor border disputes to prompt an ultimatum to Cetshwayo, demanding that his army disband and be remodeled within 30 days. Cetshwayo refused to reply, which led to a state of war. A month and a half later, a British force invaded Zululand. They moved in three columns toward the royal compound.\nOn the 22nd of January, the middle column, led by Lord Chelmsford, a favorite of the Queen, split, with Chelmsford leading a large force to support a small reconnoitering party. The 1,750 left at camp soon found themselves surrounded by nearly 20,000 Zulus. Notice was sent to Chelmsford, but he would not be deflected from his plan. The resulting massacre at Isandhlwana reduced the middle column by 1,350 men. Some SECTION 4:\nCritical\nAnalysis and Reasoning Skills MCAT\nof the survivors retreated to Rorke's Drift, where they joined a small force of about 100 men who had successfully held off a few thousand warriors.\nNews of the massacre made its way to England, but Chelmsford, quite the modern military man, had already put a cover-up in place. He managed to convince the Queen and some of the press that Isandhlwana was overcome due to a lack of ammunition, and he put forth Rorke's Drift as a major victory, allowing that minor skirmish to be glorified as the massacre was all but forgotten. He would later blame Isandhlwana on the disobedience of an officer who died there.\nChelmsford's self-supporting propaganda was effective for a while, but as the Zulu War turned even bloodier, albeit more successful for the British, he was eventually recalled and replaced by Field Marshal Wolseley. Wolseley would command the British troops through the final campaigns of the Zulu War, campaigns that culminated in the capture of King Cetshwayo. The British divided up Cetshwayo's kingdom into 13 minichiefdoms, granting 11 to Zulus, 1 to a pro-British Basuto chief, and 1 to a white African mercenary. This plan led to many years of civil war, and in 1882, the British restored Cetshwayo to his throne, leaving his son in charge of a nearby territory. In 1883 that son joined with a band of Boer mercenaries and invaded his father's kraal, forcing his father into exile, where he soon died under mysterious circumstances. In league with the Boer who would become the first prime minister of South Africa, Louis Botha, a second son of Cetshwayo's attacked his brother and defeated his army.

Instead, emotion, and indeed the structure of the brain, can be modified through certain practices.\nThese findings are indebted to the work of psychologist Gordon Watson, who in 1930 conducted a study entitled \"Happiness Among Adult Students of Education.\" Because happiness was considered a highly desired yet elusive and mysterious emotion, Watson's serious endeavor was startling.

In fact, this area also determines personality, including emotional predispositions. Levels of activity on the right and left sides of the cerebral cortex relate to feelings of happiness and sadness. Specifically, higher levels of activity at the left frontal area of the cerebral cortex coincide with feelings of happiness, For example, meditation has been shown to generate left-brain activity, and studies show that it produces positive emotions. Davidson studied the link between meditation and happiness through a project involving Tibetan Buddhist monks. His research brings together Eastern and Western traditions, and it links together objective reality with internal states of consciousness once thought to be subjective. The connection is made through observable electrical activity in the central nervous system. When the monks in the study meditated, their brain activity was recorded. Increases in left cerebral cortex activity indicate that the practice of meditation can, over time, change the structure of the brain, increasing the size and activity level of the left cerebral cortex.\nAnother practice that has been shown to stimulate left cerebral cortex activity and enhance feelings of happiness is the altering of conscious thoughts. More specifically, when a subject repeats positive affirmations_thinking optimistic thoughts-activity in the left cerebral cortex increases. As with the practice of meditation, the repetition of positive affirmations can change the structure of the brain over time, creating feelings of happiness and well-being.

The connection is made through observable electrical activity in the central nervous system. When the monks in the study meditated, their brain activity was recorded. Increases in left cerebral cortex activity indicate that the practice of meditation can, over time, change the structure of the brain, increasing the size and activity level of the left cerebral cortex.\nAnother practice that has been shown to stimulate left cerebral cortex activity and enhance feelings of happiness is the altering of conscious thoughts. More specifically, when a subject repeats positive affirmations_thinking optimistic thoughts-activity in the left cerebral cortex increases. As with the practice of meditation, the repetition of positive affirmations can change the structure of the brain over time, creating feelings of happiness and well-being.

You need to assess evidence for this question. Because authors ideally use examples to support their statements, you need to find the information that explains why Watson's study was thought to be startling.

We can actively choose to be happy. It was previously thought that levels of happiness were genetically determined; people were born with a genetic predisposition to cheerfulness or pessimism. However, studies now suggest that such predispositions, although present, are not fixed. Instead, emotion, and indeed the structure of the brain, can be modified through certain practices.\nThese findings are indebted to the work of psychologist Gordon Watson, who in 1930 conducted a study entitled \"Happiness Among Adult Students of Education.\" Because happiness was considered a highly desired yet elusive and mysterious emotion, Watson's serious endeavor was startling.

Today, it is estimated that over 2000 researchers in 42 countries are actively involved in happiness research.\nIn that crowded field, the work of a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Richard Davidson, stands out. Davidson observed patterns of brain activity as they related to a subject's mental and emotional states, using brain science's new technologies, including quantitative electrophysiology, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. He discovered what Western science once believed to be impossible: that the brain is not a static organ-it is able to change and develop over time.

He organized a student strike at the age of 15 and later worked to unseat the Mexican dictator Huerta, attaining the rank of captain during the revolution that was taking place. He later brought his tactical knowledge to the world of organized labor, where his activism led to lengthy jail terms. That is where he created some of his finest artworks on canvas.
