{"Problem Number": "2_0_19", "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_2", "Problem Statement": "\nNitric oxide (NO) is a gas that plays important regulatory roles in mammalian processes as diverse as inflammation, blood flow, kidney function, and development. Nitric oxide is created from L-arginine using the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). In studies using mouse models, NO has been shown to be a critical regulator of early embryo development. Manipulation of $\\mathrm{NO}$ in the mouse embryo at the two-cell stage of development can prevent further development of the embryo to the blastocyst stage of development.\nIn order to determine a more specific role for NO in early development, 2-day mouse embryos (composed of two cells) were subjected to treatment by either sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or L-arganine methyl ester (L-NAME). Sodium nitroprusside is a NO donor, while L-NAME is a NOS inhibitor. In addition to a control group, three concentrations of SNP and three concentrations of L-NAME were tested. Each group consisted of 100 embryos. After the appropriate treatment, the number of embryos continuing to the blastocyst stage was counted and reported as follows:\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\\hline Group & Treatment & Number of Embryos Reaching the Blastocyst Stage \\\\\n\\hline 1 & Control & 84 \\\\\n2 & $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ SNP & 88 \\\\\n3 & $1.0 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ SNP & 45 \\\\\n4 & $10.0 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ SNP & 0 \\\\\n5 & $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ L-NAME & 52 \\\\\n6 & $1.0 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ L-NAME & 35 \\\\\n7 & $10.0 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ L-NAME & 9 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\nWhich of the following would be the MOST appropriate treatment for the control group in this experiment?", "Answer Candidates": ["treatment with a known amount of SNP associated with a known value of NO needed to continue development", "treatment with SNP at a level lower than $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$", "treatment with L-NAME at a dosage higher than $10.0 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$", "treatment with neither SNP nor L-NAME\nSECTION 1:\nBiological and\nBiochemical\nFoundations of Living Systems MCAT"], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is D.

{"Problem Number": "2_0_34", "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_2", "Problem Statement": "\nPlants are able to perform all of the necessary functions and processes to maintain life through photosynthesis-the biochemical conversion of sunlight to the important nutrient, sugar, and the uptake of water through its roots. The uptake of water from the roots, through the stem, and into the tissue of the plant occurs via capillary actionthe motion of fluid through extremely small vessels or tubes. Capillary action involves the interaction of the following two types of forces: adhesive forces that allow the water's molecules to adhere or stick to the plant tissues and cohesive forces that provide an attraction between water molecules. Upward movement of the water through the capillary vessels occurs when the adhesive forces are greater than the cohesive forces. The height, $h$, that the water will ascend up the plant depends upon the surface tension, $T$, of the water according to the equation:\n$$\nh=\\frac{2 T}{\\rho g r}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of water $\\left(=1000 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}\\right), g$ is the acceleration due to gravity $\\left(=9.8 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}\\right)$, and $r$ is the radius of the plant stem.\nTo explore capillary action, the following experiment was conducted to determine the effects of sugar in water transported up the stem of identical carnation flowers. Three beakers were each filled with $0.5 \\mathrm{~L}$ of water. One beaker (beaker 1) was set aside with no sugar added to the water.
