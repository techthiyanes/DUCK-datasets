To answer this question, you need to analyze the data provided. Looking at the number of embryos surviving, you should notice that all three groups treated with any dosage of L-NAME had decreased survival as compared to the control group. The passage explains that L-NAME is a NOS inhibitor. If the enzyme needed to convert L-arginine to NO does not work, then NO levels will be decreased. The data suggest that a decreased level of $\\mathrm{NO}$ provided by the L-NAME treatment is detrimental. Further, the higher the dose of L-NAME, the more inhibition of NOS and the less NO provided, led to a dose dependent decrease in survival that eliminates choice $\\mathrm{C}$ as an option. The passage also explains that SNP is a NO donor, which increases NO levels. According to the data provided for the SNP groups, a small increase in NO (seen in group 2) seems to increase embryo survival. However, as the SNP dose becomes larger (and the higher the level of NO provided), this will lead to decreased survival. The highest rates of survival were seen in the $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SNP group, and survival decreased with increased dosage of SNP. This would eliminate choice B since increasing levels of NOS would increase NO levels similar to SNP treatment. The data show that SNP treatment (which increases NO levels) is most detrimental to embryo survival. Choice D directly contradicts this. The best conclusion is that $\\mathrm{NO}$ is necessary for development, since the data showed that the NO inhibition leads to decreased survival. However, only a certain amount of NO is needed as high levels also lead to decreased rates of embryo survival.", "Final Answer": "A", "Images": ["2_0_20_0.jpg"], "Problem Type": "Multiple choice"}

The myelin sheath is used to insulate the axons of neurons. Within the myelin sheath there are gaps, known as nodes of Ranvier, where the myelin is absent. Action potentials move down the axon and jump from one node to the next. When the myelin is removed, the gap from one node to the next becomes so large that the action potential can no longer jump the gap. This means that the action potential never reaches the end of the neuron, and the message is not passed to other neurons. Choice $\\mathrm{A}$ is most indicative of this problem. Choice $\\mathrm{B}$ suggests that the problem is with the response of muscle cells to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. If the action potential never reaches the end of the neuron, acetylcholine will not be released to the neuromuscular junction; therefore, the issue is not with the muscle cells' response.

{"Problem Number": "3_0_31", "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_3", "Problem Statement": "In a famous series of experiments, the social psychologist Stanley Milgram captured important observations about human compliance. Participants in the experiments were told to play the role of \"teachers\" and ask \"learners\" to answer questions. They were not told that the learners were actually actors. Every time a learner gave an incorrect answer, a confederate posing as an authority figure instructed the teacher to administer an electric shock to the learner. The learner would then pretend to suffer pain, even though the \"shock\" delivered via a realistic-looking apparatus was actually harmless. If a learner continued to provide incorrect answers, the authority figure told the teacher to increase the intensity of the \"shock\" all the way up to what was said to be a lethal level.\nThe results from the experiment are depicted in the following graph.\nThe Milgram experiment. Pretended shock intensity is listed on the $x$-axis and the number of participants who refused to continue past each level is presented on the $y$-axis.

(1963). \"Behavioral study of obedience.\" The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 67(4), 371-378.\nThe Milgram experiment has been repeated in a number of cultures and with a number of design changes. Based on your knowledge of social psychology, what was shown to reduce the likelihood of the participant teacher administering a perceived lethal shock?", "Answer Candidates": ["The experiment was completed in a formal lab where the teacher was alone with the authority figure.", "The authority figure was dressed in a lab coat and stood close to the teacher when giving the commands.", "The participant teachers were recruited from an older population.", "The participant teachers took part in a group discussion about the importance of ethics immediately prior to the teaching portion of the experiment."], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{D}$. Oncogenes develop when a proto-oncogene activates. In order for a virus to carry an oncogene into its host, that virus must be derived from a virus that picked up the gene from a former host cell. Spontaneous mutation alone could not account for a virus acquiring an entire proto-oncogene, which eliminates choice A. Viruses do not conjugate, so choice B can be eliminated as well. Transformation occurs when a cell incorporates foreign DNA from its environment into its own genome. This occurs with bacteria but not viruses, meaning that choice $\\mathrm{C}$ can also be eliminated. This leaves transduction as the only choice. When a virus excises from the host chromosome, it can take with it genes from the host's chromosome. A virus could feasibly acquire an activated oncogene when excising from its host, and this gene could be transferred to a new host.", "Final Answer": "D", "Images": ["3_0_31_0.jpg"], "Problem Type": "Multiple choice"}

This question requires you to locate the most logical explanation as to why antibiotic genes are often purposefully transferred along with a gene of interest in biotechnology procedures. Because the question does not provide information on what type of cells are being transformed, don't assume anything. Choice A suggests that you need resistance genes transferred so the cells can survive in the presence of antibiotics. If the cells transformed are not bacterial, they would survive anyway, as antibiotics would target and kill only bacteria.
