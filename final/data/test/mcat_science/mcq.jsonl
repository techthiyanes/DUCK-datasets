{"Problem Number": "3_0_13", "Problem Statement": "The study of emotional experience is often characterized by the attempt to answer the question, \"Which comes first, the experience or the label?\" Some researchers suggest that the physiological arousal occurs, then the individual contextualizes the experience based on his or her environment, resulting in emotion such as \"fear\" or \"happiness.\" Other researchers suggest that humans can subconsciously identify the difference in arousal caused by various emotional states or that the arousal and classification occur in parallel.\nRecent research has examined the relationship between culture and emotion. One such study examined the differences between how American and Japanese participants contextualize emotion. The researchers examined athletes' use of emotionrelated words in interviews. Compared to American athletes, Japanese athletes were found to be more likely to identify emotions with others than with themselves. Based on these findings, the researchers conducted a second experiment in which they asked Japanese and American participants to describe typical emotions experienced by Olympic medalists. The researchers counted the number of emotion-related words and assigned them to either self-focused or self+other-focused groups for comparison.\nThe results of the second study are shown in the following graph.\nNumber of emotion words used by American and Japanese participants.

{"Problem Number": "2_0_45", "Problem Statement": "\nResearch investigating behavior in social situations has found that social behavior varies depending on the environment. Social behavior can involve either shallow acting or deep acting. Shallow acting requires altering facial expressions and body language so that on the surface, the individual conveys an emotion or opinion to conform to the social situation but does not really experience that emotion/opinion. Deep acting requires alteration of inner beliefs such that the individual believes the emotion or opinion he or she is expressing in order to conform to the situation.\nIn one study, deep acting and shallow acting in a social situation were examined for customer-service workers. These workers routinely interacted with customers by smiling at them, speaking with them, responding to their queries, and detailing the benefits of various products.

To answer this question, you need to analyze the data provided. Looking at the number of embryos surviving, you should notice that all three groups treated with any dosage of L-NAME had decreased survival as compared to the control group. The passage explains that L-NAME is a NOS inhibitor. If the enzyme needed to convert L-arginine to NO does not work, then NO levels will be decreased. The data suggest that a decreased level of $\\mathrm{NO}$ provided by the L-NAME treatment is detrimental. Further, the higher the dose of L-NAME, the more inhibition of NOS and the less NO provided, led to a dose dependent decrease in survival that eliminates choice $\\mathrm{C}$ as an option. The passage also explains that SNP is a NO donor, which increases NO levels. According to the data provided for the SNP groups, a small increase in NO (seen in group 2) seems to increase embryo survival. However, as the SNP dose becomes larger (and the higher the level of NO provided), this will lead to decreased survival. The highest rates of survival were seen in the $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SNP group, and survival decreased with increased dosage of SNP. This would eliminate choice B since increasing levels of NOS would increase NO levels similar to SNP treatment. The data show that SNP treatment (which increases NO levels) is most detrimental to embryo survival. Choice D directly contradicts this. The best conclusion is that $\\mathrm{NO}$ is necessary for development, since the data showed that the NO inhibition leads to decreased survival. However, only a certain amount of NO is needed as high levels also lead to decreased rates of embryo survival.", "Final Answer": "A"}

{"Problem Number": "2_0_15", "Problem Statement": "\nThe discovery and development of various types of anesthesia have revolutionized modern medicine, allowing many medical procedures to be performed with minimal discomfort to the patient. Local anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation in a particular area, while general anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation along with loss of consciousness. Both procaine (also known as novocaine) and lidocaine are drugs used for local anesthesia, and they have similar mechanisms of action. The drugs affect neurons in the local areas to which they are applied by preventing the opening of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels in the neurons.\nProcaine and lidocaine have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, procaine has the ability to cause vasoconstriction in addition to its analgesic properties. However, lidocaine induces anesthesia faster and for a longer period of time than procaine. In addition to being used as an anesthetic, lidocaine is often used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, a condition where the cardiac muscle displays rapid, uncoordinated, and weak rhythms. The drug causes decreased excitability of the ventricles by blocking $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels, while the sinoatrial node in the right atrium is unaffected by the drug.\nProcaine has a half-life of up to $0.5$ hours in patients. When procaine is metabolized in the body, it is converted to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and PABA is then excreted by the kidneys. Lidocaine is twice as potent as procaine, but lidocaine is also twice as toxic. The half-life of lidocaine in patients is typically between $1.5$ and 2 hours. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver by two enzymes that produce the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide.

{"Problem Number": "1_0_1", "Problem Statement": "\nLeukemia is a term that describes a wide variety of blood cell cancers. Most leukemia cases involve elevated leukocyte counts. In acute cases of leukemia, immature leukocytes proliferate quickly, which leads to many abnormal immature cells in the bone marrow. This inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce healthy new leukocytes. This form of the cancer progresses rapidly, and the cells metastasize easily as they move into the bloodstream from the bone marrow. It can be fatal within weeks or months if not treated promptly. In contrast, chronic cases of leukemia typically involve the proliferation of abnormal mature leukocytes. This form of the disease progresses more slowly, and treatment need not always be immediate.\nOnce classified as acute or chronic, leukemia can be further subdivided into lymphocytic or myelogenous. This distinction depends on which type of leukocyte is abnormal in the patient. In lymphocytic leukemia, the lymphoid cells, such as the lymphocytes, are abnormal. In the myelogenous form, the myeloid cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils, are affected.\nChemotherapy drugs are often used in the management of leukemia cases. There are numerous categories of these drugs, and they have varied mechanisms of action. In treatment, several drugs are used in combination because some of the drugs are cell-cycle specific while others are not. Alkylating agents are capable of disrupting the function of DNA. Tubulin-binding agents are designed to interfere with microtubule formation. Other drugs are designed to interfere with DNA polymerase, DNA repair mechanisms, or protein synthesis, or to act as purine analogs. Many of these drugs cannot enter into the brain when injected or ingested, so if the cancer has spread to\nthis area, special methods must be used to introduce the drugs to the brain.\nWhat would be the BEST explanation as to why people with chronic forms of leukemia can live longer untreated than those with acute cases of leukemia?", "Answer Candidates": ["Chronic cases involve types of leukocytes that have less important functions in the body.", "Chronic cases of leukemia involve abnormal cell division of mature cells, so there are still some immature cells that can proliferate into normal mature cells.", "The immune system is less likely to recognize and destroy abnormal immature leukocytes than it would be to recognize and destroy abnormal mature leukocytes.", "all of the above"], "Images": [], "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Solution": "The correct answer is B.

The best explanation for why two phenotypes (complete protection and partial protection) are observed would be that the delta-32 allele exhibits incomplete dominance. An individual that is homozygous for the allele (meaning he or she inherited two copies of the delta-32 allele) would have full protection, while an individual who is heterozygous (meaning he or she has one normal copy of the allele and one copy of the delta-32 allele) would have an intermediate phenotype (being partial protection).

Endothelin is capable of binding to two different receptors. There are receptors for endothelin located on smooth muscle (ETA) and receptors for endothelin located on vascular endothelium (ETB). When endothelin binds to ETA, it initiates vasoconstriction by narrowing blood vessels. However, when endothelin binds to ETB, vasodilation occurs due to the widening of blood vessels.

Failure of the kidneys or respiratory system can have drastic consequences on the body's ability to regulate blood $\\mathrm{pH}$. In order to regulate $\\mathrm{pH}$ in the blood, a buffering system is used, which is shown. This reaction is completely reversible and is driven in either direction depending on the concentration of the reactants. A change to one item in this reaction will in turn affect the concentration of all of the other items. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase:\nGenerally, there are not many problems with the body's ability to have plenty of $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ ions in reserve. However, if $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ion levels should become too low, the kidneys can generate more. In the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of the nephrons, carbonic anhydrase converts $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which dissociates into $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Kidney failure or damage to the carbonic anhydrase enzyme can cause major problems in the ability to regulate blood $\\mathrm{pH}$.\nWhen the kidneys fail, their functions must be mimicked or death will occur.

This question relies on knowledge of the immune response. Interleukins are cytokines that are secreted during the process of clonal selection in primary immune responses. Since they are not specific toward any one particular antigen, choice A can be eliminated. Interferons are produced as nonspecific defenses against viral infections. Virally infected cells secrete interferons that are detected by neighboring cells. Secretion of interferons gives neighboring cells the chance to increase their immune defenses so that they do not become infected by the virus. Since interferons are nonspecific, their presence would not indicate immunity against a specific virus, which eliminates choice B. The components of the complement system circulate in the plasma and are activated by bacteria that may enter the blood. Activation of the complement system ultimately lyses and kills the bacterial cell. Since the question is asking about a virus, choice C can be eliminated because it deals with bacteria.

{"Problem Number": "1_0_3", "Problem Statement": "\nLeukemia is a term that describes a wide variety of blood cell cancers. Most leukemia cases involve elevated leukocyte counts. In acute cases of leukemia, immature leukocytes proliferate quickly, which leads to many abnormal immature cells in the bone marrow. This inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce healthy new leukocytes. This form of the cancer progresses rapidly, and the cells metastasize easily as they move into the bloodstream from the bone marrow. It can be fatal within weeks or months if not treated promptly. In contrast, chronic cases of leukemia typically involve the proliferation of abnormal mature leukocytes. This form of the disease progresses more slowly, and treatment need not always be immediate.\nOnce classified as acute or chronic, leukemia can be further subdivided into lymphocytic or myelogenous. This distinction depends on which type of leukocyte is abnormal in the patient. In lymphocytic leukemia, the lymphoid cells, such as the lymphocytes, are abnormal. In the myelogenous form, the myeloid cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils, are affected.\nChemotherapy drugs are often used in the management of leukemia cases. There are numerous categories of these drugs, and they have varied mechanisms of action. In treatment, several drugs are used in combination because some of the drugs are cell-cycle specific while others are not. Alkylating agents are capable of disrupting the function of DNA. Tubulin-binding agents are designed to interfere with microtubule formation. Other drugs are designed to interfere with DNA polymerase, DNA repair mechanisms, or protein synthesis, or to act as purine analogs. Many of these drugs cannot enter into the brain when injected or ingested, so if the cancer has spread to\nthis area, special methods must be used to introduce the drugs to the brain.\nA variety of risk factors exist for leukemia.

{"Problem Number": "2_0_16", "Problem Statement": "\nThe discovery and development of various types of anesthesia have revolutionized modern medicine, allowing many medical procedures to be performed with minimal discomfort to the patient. Local anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation in a particular area, while general anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation along with loss of consciousness. Both procaine (also known as novocaine) and lidocaine are drugs used for local anesthesia, and they have similar mechanisms of action. The drugs affect neurons in the local areas to which they are applied by preventing the opening of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels in the neurons.\nProcaine and lidocaine have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, procaine has the ability to cause vasoconstriction in addition to its analgesic properties. However, lidocaine induces anesthesia faster and for a longer period of time than procaine. In addition to being used as an anesthetic, lidocaine is often used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, a condition where the cardiac muscle displays rapid, uncoordinated, and weak rhythms. The drug causes decreased excitability of the ventricles by blocking $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels, while the sinoatrial node in the right atrium is unaffected by the drug.\nProcaine has a half-life of up to $0.5$ hours in patients. When procaine is metabolized in the body, it is converted to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and PABA is then excreted by the kidneys. Lidocaine is twice as potent as procaine, but lidocaine is also twice as toxic. The half-life of lidocaine in patients is typically between $1.5$ and 2 hours.

{"Problem Number": "3_0_15", "Problem Statement": "The study of emotional experience is often characterized by the attempt to answer the question, \"Which comes first, the experience or the label?\" Some researchers suggest that the physiological arousal occurs, then the individual contextualizes the experience based on his or her environment, resulting in emotion such as \"fear\" or \"happiness.\" Other researchers suggest that humans can subconsciously identify the difference in arousal caused by various emotional states or that the arousal and classification occur in parallel.\nRecent research has examined the relationship between culture and emotion. One such study examined the differences between how American and Japanese participants contextualize emotion. The researchers examined athletes' use of emotionrelated words in interviews. Compared to American athletes, Japanese athletes were found to be more likely to identify emotions with others than with themselves. Based on these findings, the researchers conducted a second experiment in which they asked Japanese and American participants to describe typical emotions experienced by Olympic medalists. The researchers counted the number of emotion-related words and assigned them to either self-focused or self+other-focused groups for comparison.\nThe results of the second study are shown in the following graph.\nNumber of emotion words used by American and Japanese participants.

{"Problem Number": "2_0_17", "Problem Statement": "\nThe discovery and development of various types of anesthesia have revolutionized modern medicine, allowing many medical procedures to be performed with minimal discomfort to the patient. Local anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation in a particular area, while general anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation along with loss of consciousness. Both procaine (also known as novocaine) and lidocaine are drugs used for local anesthesia, and they have similar mechanisms of action. The drugs affect neurons in the local areas to which they are applied by preventing the opening of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels in the neurons.\nProcaine and lidocaine have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, procaine has the ability to cause vasoconstriction in addition to its analgesic properties. However, lidocaine induces anesthesia faster and for a longer period of time than procaine. In addition to being used as an anesthetic, lidocaine is often used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, a condition where the cardiac muscle displays rapid, uncoordinated, and weak rhythms. The drug causes decreased excitability of the ventricles by blocking $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels, while the sinoatrial node in the right atrium is unaffected by the drug.\nProcaine has a half-life of up to $0.5$ hours in patients. When procaine is metabolized in the body, it is converted to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and PABA is then excreted by the kidneys. Lidocaine is twice as potent as procaine, but lidocaine is also twice as toxic. The half-life of lidocaine in patients is typically between $1.5$ and 2 hours. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver by two enzymes that produce the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide.

{"Problem Number": "1_0_2", "Problem Statement": "\nLeukemia is a term that describes a wide variety of blood cell cancers. Most leukemia cases involve elevated leukocyte counts. In acute cases of leukemia, immature leukocytes proliferate quickly, which leads to many abnormal immature cells in the bone marrow. This inhibits the ability of the bone marrow to produce healthy new leukocytes. This form of the cancer progresses rapidly, and the cells metastasize easily as they move into the bloodstream from the bone marrow. It can be fatal within weeks or months if not treated promptly. In contrast, chronic cases of leukemia typically involve the proliferation of abnormal mature leukocytes. This form of the disease progresses more slowly, and treatment need not always be immediate.\nOnce classified as acute or chronic, leukemia can be further subdivided into lymphocytic or myelogenous. This distinction depends on which type of leukocyte is abnormal in the patient. In lymphocytic leukemia, the lymphoid cells, such as the lymphocytes, are abnormal. In the myelogenous form, the myeloid cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils, are affected.\nChemotherapy drugs are often used in the management of leukemia cases. There are numerous categories of these drugs, and they have varied mechanisms of action. In treatment, several drugs are used in combination because some of the drugs are cell-cycle specific while others are not. Alkylating agents are capable of disrupting the function of DNA. Tubulin-binding agents are designed to interfere with microtubule formation. Other drugs are designed to interfere with DNA polymerase, DNA repair mechanisms, or protein synthesis, or to act as purine analogs. Many of these drugs cannot enter into the brain when injected or ingested, so if the cancer has spread to\nthis area, special methods must be used to introduce the drugs to the brain.\nWhat is the most logical explanation for why certain drugs may NOT be able to reach the brain if they have been ingested or injected?", "Answer Candidates": ["These drugs have a chemical nature that does not allow them to cross the blood-brain barrier.", "These drugs are so toxic that they are broken down before they reach the brain.", "Most of these drugs target only cancerous cells that normally would not be in the brain.", "The drugs that have been ingested have likely been denatured by the acids in the stomach."], "Images": [], "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_1", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{A}$.

While choice D might seem plausible if a drug was ingested, it would not make sense for a drug that was injected.", "Final Answer": "A"}

When the nephrons absorb more water to increase blood volume, the urine volume decreases. The two hormones aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone help increase the amount of water reabsorbed by nephrons, which in turn decreases urine volume. In order to reduce blood pressure, the kidneys can decrease the amount of water reabsorbed by the nephrons. The less water reabsorbed means there will be less blood volume and less blood pressure.

{"Problem Number": "2_0_4", "Problem Statement": "\nMaintenance of proper $\\mathrm{pH}$ throughout the body is critical to homeostasis and is carried out through the collective efforts of multiple systems in the body. Failure of the kidneys or respiratory system can have drastic consequences on the body's ability to regulate blood $\\mathrm{pH}$. In order to regulate $\\mathrm{pH}$ in the blood, a buffering system is used, which is shown. This reaction is completely reversible and is driven in either direction depending on the concentration of the reactants. A change to one item in this reaction will in turn affect the concentration of all of the other items. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase:\nGenerally, there are not many problems with the body's ability to have plenty of $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ ions in reserve. However, if $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ion levels should become too low, the kidneys can generate more. In the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of the nephrons, carbonic anhydrase converts $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which dissociates into $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

Another way to say this is that the blood must be hypotonic (contain less solutes and more water) than the dialysis fluid (choice C).

In a classic series of studies, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus investigated the storage and recall of information in memory.

The forgetting curve has been studied in a variety of different environments and for a variety of different stimuli.\nOn day 1 of a memory research study, participants were asked to learn a list of items. Researchers then tracked the proportion of the list that the participants remembered as time passed. On day 2 , some participants were asked to relearn the list. Again, the proportion remembered was tracked over time. On day 3 , some participants were asked to relearn the list a second time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time. On day 4, some participants were asked to relearn the list a third time, and the proportion they remembered was tracked over time.\nThe data from this study produced the following set of forgetting curves.

Failure of the kidneys or respiratory system can have drastic consequences on the body's ability to regulate blood $\\mathrm{pH}$. In order to regulate $\\mathrm{pH}$ in the blood, a buffering system is used, which is shown. This reaction is completely reversible and is driven in either direction depending on the concentration of the reactants. A change to one item in this reaction will in turn affect the concentration of all of the other items. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase:\nGenerally, there are not many problems with the body's ability to have plenty of $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ ions in reserve. However, if $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ion levels should become too low, the kidneys can generate more. In the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of the nephrons, carbonic anhydrase converts $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which dissociates into $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

{"Problem Number": "2_0_18", "Problem Statement": "\nThe discovery and development of various types of anesthesia have revolutionized modern medicine, allowing many medical procedures to be performed with minimal discomfort to the patient. Local anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation in a particular area, while general anesthesia is used to induce loss of sensation along with loss of consciousness. Both procaine (also known as novocaine) and lidocaine are drugs used for local anesthesia, and they have similar mechanisms of action. The drugs affect neurons in the local areas to which they are applied by preventing the opening of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels in the neurons.\nProcaine and lidocaine have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, procaine has the ability to cause vasoconstriction in addition to its analgesic properties. However, lidocaine induces anesthesia faster and for a longer period of time than procaine. In addition to being used as an anesthetic, lidocaine is often used in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, a condition where the cardiac muscle displays rapid, uncoordinated, and weak rhythms. The drug causes decreased excitability of the ventricles by blocking $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gated channels, while the sinoatrial node in the right atrium is unaffected by the drug.\nProcaine has a half-life of up to $0.5$ hours in patients. When procaine is metabolized in the body, it is converted to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and PABA is then excreted by the kidneys. Lidocaine is twice as potent as procaine, but lidocaine is also twice as toxic. The half-life of lidocaine in patients is typically between $1.5$ and 2 hours.

In this study, during a training phase participants were instructed to listen to two separate study lists of musical sections, some familiar and some novel. Later, during a testing phase, participants listened to a mix including all of the initial melodies as well as an equal number of distractors. They were then asked to tell whether they had heard a melody during the training phase and, if so, which of the two study lists the melody was from.\nPercent of familiar and novel melodies that were correctly identified as being from a specific study list. \nPercent of familiar and novel melodies that were correctly identified as being from one of the two study lists, but not a specific list.\nA year later, participants are asked which melodies on each list had been heard. In the interval, what has MOST likely occurred for remembered melodies over the course of the year?", "Answer Candidates": ["Long-term potentiation has created long-lasting excitatory circuits for the memory trace.", "Synapses associated with other details have been pruned, resulting in higher activation for the remembered melodies.", "Memories of the melodies have remained unchanged and performance will correspond to the intact memories.", "Synapses associated with other details have been reinforced due to conscious rehearsal of the memories."], "Images": ["2_0_18_0.jpg", "2_1_18_1.jpg"], "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_2", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{A}$. The rate would increase. The second reaction involves the $\\operatorname{Ad}_{\\mathrm{N}}$ reaction between an alcohol and an acyl chloride, as shown here:\n![](Image URL)Since the subsequent reactions (loss of chloride and proton transfer) are rapid, this is the rate-limiting step. Therefore, the rate law for this reaction would be:\n\\section{rate $=k[\\mathrm{BzCl}][\\mathrm{ROH}]$}\nIncreasing the concentration of alcohol ( $\\mathrm{ROH})$ would then increase the reaction rate.", "Final Answer": "A"}

The question explains that AZT and ddI interfere with replication and transcription. During a viral infection, the ideal situation would be to interfere with viral processes while leaving host cell processes unaffected. Choice A suggests that host cell DNA replication should be prevented in order to keep the host cell from functioning and mentions nothing about how this would affect the virus. Choice B is similar in that it does not mention how the virus would be affected. Choice $\\mathrm{C}$ is not appropriate because it discusses preventing infection. If the patient is already confirmed as infected, then this choice wouldn't make sense. If a person is infected with HIV, then the viral genetic material has already entered the host cells. If replication of the viral genome can be prevented as suggested by choice $\\mathrm{D}$, then the progression of the infection can be slowed.", "Final Answer": "D"}
{"Problem Number": "3_0_10", "Problem Statement": "Jean Piaget, a prominent figure in developmental psychology, believed that the development of all cognitive abilities occurred during the first two years of life. Piaget devised various procedures for examining development in young children. These activities focused on how children (and people) think and how they interact with the world around them. Piaget asserted that biological changes interacted with childhood experiences, resulting in unique developmental stages characterized by schemas, or mental structures. The following table lists the four stages of development identified by Piaget and their function.\nOn a rainy day, Juan is asked why it is raining. He replies that it is raining so that he can \"play with his toy boat.\" What developmental stage is Juan likely in, and what concept has he yet to master?", "Answer Candidates": ["formal operational, decentering", "sensory motor, transitivity", "preoperational, egocentrism", "concrete operational, classification"], "Images": ["3_0_10_0.jpg"], "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_3", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{D}$. Men pass on their genetic contribution to the next generation via sperm. Any mitochondria present in sperm typically do not enter the cell. The passage indicates that all mitochondria in a given cell are derived from those in the egg cell. Because a male does not pass on any of his mitochondria to the next generation, even if he has an mtDNA disease, he could never pass it on to his children. Only when the mtDNA of the egg cell is affected can the disease be passed on.", "Final Answer": "D"}
{"Problem Number": "2_0_6", "Problem Statement": "\nEvolutionary psychology has advanced our understanding of mate selection in humans. A prominent researcher, David Buss, conducted a number of research studies to investigate the evolutionary theory of mate selection in a wide range of cultures.\nThe following data are a hypothetical adaptation of research looking at mate retention. The data are based on a study by Buss and Shackelford studying mate retention\nMate retention tactics by sex. Source: Based on research conducted by D. M. Buss \\& T. K.

Participants were asked about tactics that they have engaged in while in a relationship. Love and care are forms of comforting tactics. Resource display includes tactics such as buying presents. Verbal possession includes labels such as \"wife\" or \"boyfriend\" or other tactics announcing that a mate is spoken for in social situations. Violence against others represents physical aggression against other people perceived to be making advances toward one's mate. In the graph, the $y$-axis represents the percent of participants indicating that have used the tactic. The $x$-axis represents the tactic, with the vertical bars indicating the different sexes.\nWhich of the following statements represents how evolutionary psychology interprets the results shown?", "Answer Candidates": ["Men are more likely to use resource display because women value financial status as a characteristic in a mate; high financial status means that a man can support offspring and increase their likelihood of survival.", "Men are more likely to use resource display because women like nice gifts from their mate.", "Men are more likely to use resource display because it proves that they are powerful, and women are more loyal to powerful men out of fear.", "Men are more likely to use resource display because it will attract multiple women; in that case, it is not a problem if a man loses his current mate."], "Images": ["2_0_6_0.jpg"], "Topic": "MCAT Science", "Source": "MCAT_2", "Solution": "The correct answer is $\\mathrm{B}$. The question indicates that the toxins being referred to are small in size. We can assume that they are at a high concentration in the blood as compared to the concentration of the dialysis fluid. Choice A can be eliminated because active transport moves substances from a lower concentration to a higher concentration. In this case, we want to move the toxins from a higher concentration (the blood) to a lower concentration (the dialysis fluid). This would indicate that diffusion (choice B) would be appropriate. Osmosis deals only with the movement of water, which will not help move the toxins out of the blood.\nPassage II", "Final Answer": "B"}
