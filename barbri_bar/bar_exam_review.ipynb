      "St. Minny, a town with a population of 30,000 , was located on the west bank of a small river. Immediately across the river, on the east bank, was Paulopolis, a city of 60,000 . Over the years, many civic improvement groups urged that the two municipalities be merged into \"Minnypaulos,\" a single city of 90,000 souls. The arguments in favor of merger stressed savings to taxpayers accruing from the elimination of duplicate services. Proposals to merge the two places had appeared as referenda on the ballot on two separate occasions. Although the voters of Paulopolis approved each proposal by heavy margins, the voters of St. Minny, fearing that control of the government would be in the hands of more populous Paulopolis, rejected the referendum proposals by more than two to one.\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid the failure of yet another such referendum, a new proposal was made for the governance of the proposed combined city. For a period of 20 years, beginning at the date of the merger, the city council of the merged city would consist of six persons. The former Paulopolis would be divided into three council districts, as would the former city of St. Minny. Thus, each St. Minny council representative would be elected from a district with a population of 10,000, while the Paulopolis districts would contain 20,000 persons each. A mayor would be elected at large. The proposal was placed on the ballot and was carried by large majorities in both St. Minny and Paulopolis. Representatives from Paulopolis and St. Minny carved each former city into three council electoral districts. Three Paulopolis taxpayers filed suit to enjoin the holding of an election with council districts of such disparate proportions.\n",

      "To help alleviate the burdens of poverty and perhaps to help cut the welfare rolls, the state legislature of Margate passed legislation establishing State Family Counseling Centers throughout the state. The legislature recognized that much of the \"welfare and poverty problem\" was centered on poor single-parent households headed by a woman. Therefore, it decreed in the legislation that all counseling would be free for single mothers with an income of less than $ 20,000$ per year. Others would have to pay fees for the counseling on a sliding scale depending upon income. The counseling services available at the State Family Counseling Centers included classes on parenting, anti-substance abuse programs, and financial counseling. The counseling centers were popular and other states considered copying the Margate model.\n",

      "Peter's wife had died recently of a drug overdose, and he was left to care for their two children (ages two and four) on an income of approximately $ 7,000$ per year. Peter had no idea how he could manage to care for the two children and himself on his small paychecks. He heard about the State Family Counseling Centers and went to the closest one for financial counseling. Peter was told that he would have to pay a $ 50$ fee for the counseling. Peter had $ 10$ in his pocket, which he needed for bus fare home and to feed his children until his check, due in five days, arrived. Peter became very angry when he learned that single mothers in his situation were entitled to free counseling while single fathers were not. A public-interest law firm agreed to take Peter's case and filed suit in federal court, asking that Peter be allowed to take advantage of the free counseling services because the law establishing them discriminated against males.\n",

      "In 2000, Rogan Josh, then age 15, emigrated with his family from Dopyaza, an Asian country. Although Josh maintained Dopyazan citizenship, he held resident alien status and complied with all federal laws and regulations regarding maintenance of resident alien status. Upon arrival in the United States, Josh, his parents, and his siblings took up residence in the state of New Jingo. In 2003, Rogan Josh began'a course of studies in petroleum engineering at New Jingo University, a state institution. Because he was a resident of New Jingo, Josh qualified for the \"in-state\" tuition rate. The \"nonresident\" tuition rate was 10 times the in-state rate, and it would be impossible for Josh to attend New Jingo University if he were required to pay the nonresident tuition.\n",

The registrar of New Jingo University, where Josh has successfully completed two years of study, informed Josh that he would have to pay the nonresident tuition rate in order to begin his junior year. Josh cannot afford to pay the tuition.\n",

      "Resident aliens cannot be blamed in retrospect for actions of their governments and, therefore, the New Jingo statute violates the constitutional prohibition of ex post facto laws.\n",

Under an aidto-education statute passed by the state legislature a few years ago, The Classical School and certain other private schools receive state benefits. Among those received by The Classical School are: (i) free textbooks from the state, (ii) an exemption from state taxes, and (iii) $20 \\%$ of its operating budget in the form of state grants. The remaining $80 \\%$ of The Classical School's budget is covered by tuition fees and by donations from alumni and others.

Timon, who had been a student activist in college, was annoyed every day when he faced classes wearing the uniform required by The Classical School. Timon kept his mouth shut until he was chosen, in the fall term of his second year, to give the monthly \"History Enrichment Lecture\" to the entire school. The topic of Timon's lecture was Europe between the two world wars. Timon's lecture was factual, balanced, and nonopinionated, until, at the end of his lecture, he told the assembled students, \"We've talked a lot this afternoon about the rise of fascism, but think about this: there is absolutely no qualitative difference between those uniforms you're wearing and those worn by the Hitler Youth. If you had any gumption you'd organize a protest against having to wear them.\" After the speech, Timon was called to the administrative office by the headmaster and fired on the spot, despite Timon's protests that he had almost two years left on his contract. Timon requested a hearing and was curtly told to leave the premises of the school immediately.\n",

      "The state of Petrolia derived most of its income from extractive industries, especially its extensive oil and natural gas fields. However, a worldwide drop in the price of petroleum was severe enough to cause a depression in Petrolia, and the state's unemployment rate soared. To counter the effect the depression was having on Petrolia's citizens, the state legislature passed a law requiring all employers operating in the state's oil and natural gas fields to give preference in hiring to residents of Petrolia. The bill banned the hiring of nonresidents unless no other qualified person could be found to fill an oilfield or natural gas field position. Under prevailing economic conditions, the statute was tantamount to a total ban on hiring of nonresidents because so many unemployed oil and gas workers had been created by the depression and little new exploration was taking place.\n",

      "\"Roughnecks,\" as oilfield workers call themselves, tend to be an itinerant lot, moving from place to place as new fields are brought into production. Driller was a 48-year-old roughneck whose permanent residence was in Louisiana. He had worked on offshore rigs in the Gulf waters off his home state, but Driller had also worked in Texas, Oklahoma, Alaska, Kuwait, Indonesia, and Venezuela. Upon hearing that one of the few independent companies actively exploring in Petrolia had struck a new field in that state, Driller drove to the field office of Ewing Exploration Company in Petrolia and applied for a job. Looking at Driller's extensive experience as described on Driller's resume, Ewing's personnel officer sadly shook his head. He indicated that Driller's qualifications were better than anyone's working in the field, but that he had more applications from experienced Petrolia residents than he had jobs to offer. The sole reason given for not hiring Driller was the preferential hiring statute favoring state residents. Driller filed suit in federal district court challenging the statute.\n",

      "The court should rule in favor of:\n",
      "Petrolia, because employment discrimina- tion is only unconstitutional if it involves race, religion, alienage, or sex.\n",

      "The citizens of Tidytown prided themselves on the neatness and beauty of the town of 30,000 people. This was reflected in the tough anti-litter ordinances that had been passed by the city council. Littering offenses carried fines of up to $ 500$ and were always very strictly enforced. Center Park was located near the downtown business area of Tidytown. Signs at each of the park entrances, and on the many trash barrels situated throughout the park, carried conspicuous warnings against littering.\n",

Approximately 125 students gathered in the park with placards and banners, and several speakers addressed the group. One of the speakers, Demagoga, during the course of her speech, walked to one of the trash barrels and dumped the contents out on the ground. As she did so, she told her listeners, \"This is what outer space is starting to look like, cluttered with the trash of nuclear weapons.\" The meeting broke up 15 minutes later. The students left the park peacefully, but no one bothered to pick up the trash or right the overturned barrel. Demagoga was arrested pursuant to the Tidytown littering ordinance. She was fined $ 500$ after her conviction.\n",

      "A statute in the state of Lemon forbids employers from discriminating on the basis of religion; however, an exception provides that established religions that employ persons to engage in nonprofit activities may be exempted from this rule. A new religion sprang up called the Church of the Sunrise. It espoused a number of nontraditional views, among which was the belief that the sun is really a temple that is moved across the sky by a powerful race of aliens. When the Church gained enough members to open a meeting place, it advertised for clerical and maintenance workers. Patricia applied for a position and was told that she would be hired if she converted to the Church of the Sunrise religion. Patricia refused to do so and complained to the state of Lemon human relations board. After investigating, the board concluded that the Church was not an established religion and its beliefs were not plausible. It ruled that the religious exemption would not be applicable and ordered the Church to hire Patricia. Church officials filed an action in federal district court challenging the board's refusal to apply the exemption.\n",

During the hottest months, the three refuse collectors in Patchquilt regularly worked well beyond the 40 hours per week standard. Because of normal vacation time and the normally heavy garbage collection schedule, it would not be possible to give the refuse collectors additional time off during the cooler months, which were not always very cool, without hiring additional refuse collectors.

      "Large semi-trailer trucks ordinarily used either \"Gripper\" tires or \"Grabber\" tires. There was some difference in the design of the tires, and a number of tire manufacturers made both types of tires, which were deemed to be equally safe by independent testing labs. Most state statutes and vehicle regulations allowed the use of both types of tires on state highways. However, State Plum and State Apricot had laws on their books permitting only Grippers and banning Grabbers. State Grapefruit, on the other hand, had a statute allowing the use of Grabbers, and banning Grippers, on its state highways. The National Trucking Board, a trade association of interstate trucking firms, brought suit to have the laws of State Plum and State Apricot declared unconstitutional. The case eventually reached the United States Supreme Court, which struck down the Apricot and Plum statutes as undue burdens on interstate commerce.\n",

      "The President of the United States entered into a bilateral agreement with Nerddistan, a sovereign nation, regarding the probate of estates. One part of the agreement provided that, should a citizen of Nerddistan die owning property in the United States or its Commonwealths or Territories, the executor or administrator appointed in Nerddistan should have the power to deal with such property and a separate American administrator or executor need not be appointed. Reciprocal rights were extended to United States citizens who died owning property in Nerddistan. Tadzik, a citizen of Nerddistan, died owning property in the United States state of Gulfstream. Tadzik's will appointed Elwwan, a citizen of Nerddistan, as executor.

After extensive public hearings it was clear that the bill had strong support in both houses of the state legislature and that, if called to a vote, the bill would pass easily. Governor Luddite had also made a major speech announcing that he would sign such a bill. However, a few members of the legislature raised questions as to the bill's constitutionality. The constitution of State Green provides that the state supreme court may hand down declaratory judgments, and the question of the bill's constitutionality was brought before the state supreme court.

When a popular City radio station was put on the market, he entered into negotiations to purchase it. However, the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") blocked the sale on the basis of a regulation forbidding ownership of a radio or television station to any entity owning a daily newspaper in the same city. The next year, however, the FCC suspended enforcement of that regulation to permit the radio station to be sold to Sumner, the owner of another daily newspaper in City.

      "The state of Plains was the headquarters of Bushel Basket Ministries, which had been characterized by the government as a \"religious cult.\" Seeking to broaden his influence, the leader of Bushel Basket, Reverend Bill E. Bob, decided that the state legislature would serve as an effective pulpit for his religious views by giving him a great deal of media exposure and direct mail resources. The state of Plains had no provision barring members of the clergy from serving as legislators. Bob entered a race that already had several other candidates and took advantage of the state's liberal voter registration laws by having many of his followers move into the district a month before the election. Bob's subsequent victory in the race shocked the political establishment and prompted a citizens' group to file a lawsuit in federal district court. The suit, invoking the Establishment Clause, sought to enjoin the state from seating Bob in the legislature or expending any state funds to provide him with legislative privileges. Bob moved to dismiss the lawsuit.\n",

      "Babe was a professional baseball player who was known both for his prowess at the plate and his perceived \"heart of gold.\" One day, Babe was visiting a sick boy named Jimmy in the hospital. Babe was touched by Jimmy's will to live despite a very poor prognosis. In a moment of weakness, Babe told Jimmy that in consideration of Jimmy's courage, he would do anything that Jimmy asked. Jimmy's eyes momentarily gleamed as he asked Babe to \"hit a homer for me in your next game.\" Babe replied, \"Sure kid.\" As Babe was leaving Jimmy's hospital room, Jimmy's father, Joe, pulled Babe aside and told Babe, \"It would mean a lot to Jimmy if you would hit a home run for him in your next game. The medicinal value of raising Jimmy's spirits would be priceless.\" Babe replied, \"Hey man, we all have problems. I don't work for the Make a Wish Foundation.\" Undaunted, Joe repeated that it would really raise Jimmy's spirits if Babe would hit a homer, and as incentive, Joe told Babe that he would pay Babe $ 5,000$ if Babe did hit a home run in his next game. Babe replied, \"You've got a deal.\" To raise his chances of collecting the $ 5,000$ from Joe, Babe took extra batting practice before his next game, and the practice paid off because in his next game, Babe hit two home runs. During a post-game interview, Babe explained, \"I did it for little Jimmy, who is in the hospital.\" After showering, Babe went directly to Joe's house and asked Joe for $ 5,000$. Babe's contract with his ball club does not forbid him from accepting money from fans for good performance.\n",

Executives at Multimedia Marketing had always responded to their invitation immediately by registered mail because they found it very worthwhile to lease a skybox to entertain their clients. During the five years that they had responded affirmatively to the invitation, they never received any additional communications from United Leasing regarding approval, but the tickets and an invoice would arrive about a week before the season began.\n",

After some discussion, Bernaise and Hollandaise agreed on all salient points and shook hands on the deal. They agreed further that Hobson, Holsauce's general counsel, would reduce the agreement to writing and that the agreement would become effective after it was drawn up and initialed by Hobson and by Barker, Bernaise's counsel. Hobson duly committed the agreement to writing and sent the writing to Barker, but without initialing it first. Barker looked over the agreement, made no changes, initialed it, and mailed the agreement to Hobson on May 1. On May 2, Hollandaise decided that Bechamel would be a better distributor than Bernaise. Therefore, also on May 2, Hollandaise had Hobson telephone Barker, telling him, \"The deal's off.\" Barker responded, \"The heck it is.

      "Fat Goose Foods (\"FGF\") was a manufacturer of quality pates and terrines made from imported goose livers and truffles. In a written agreement between FGF and Gourmet Mart (\"GM\"), a retail seller of fine quality foods, FGF agreed to \"sell all output of Fat Goose Foods liver pate to Gourmet Mart,\" and GM agreed to \"sell Fat Goose Foods pates exclusively.\" The agreement went on to state that GM would pay $ 150$ for each 10 -loaf container of pates ordered from FGF. The agreement between GM and FGF also contained the statement, \"either party may cancel this contract after two months upon giving reasonable notice to the other party.\" Assume that, after FGF faithfully filled GM's orders for six months, FGF determined that it was becoming too costly to operate the special oven used to roast the pate loaves. The oven had been manufactured in Belgium in 1937, but the plant that manufactured the oven was destroyed by bombing during World War II, and no more of the ovens were produced after 1940 . It would be difficult and expensive to find a suitable substitute, and when the oven malfunctioned, replacement parts were extremely difficult to find and very costly as well. FGF, therefore, decided to get out of the pate business entirely and to use its supply of goose livers to make a German-style liver sausage. FGF notified GM of its decision and the reasons for it, and shortly thereafter stopped shipping pate to GM. GM sued FGF, demanding that FGF continue to ship pate to GM or pay monetary damages to GM.\n",

Because Stan did not have to pay for his course until April 30, the written contract between Stan and Betsy provided that the dictionary would not be delivered to Betsy until April 20, thus giving Stan a last few extra days to peruse the dictionary's pages. Late on April 15, a terrible fire swept through Stan's apartment building and the dictionary was destroyed. Firefighters determined that the blaze started when Hugh, the tenant living below Stan, fell asleep while doing his taxes and dropped his cigarette onto his paperwork. Fortunately for Stan, he had insurance that covered all of his damages, including compensation for the destroyed dictionary. On April 20, Stan told Betsy of the fire, but still demanded payment, claiming that Betsy was the equitable owner of the dictionary when it was destroyed, and explaining that she could have obtained insurance on the dictionary had she wanted to, since she had an insurable interest in the dictionary as soon as the contract was made. Betsy refused to pay. Stan brings an action against Betsy for the $ 1,500$.\n",

The president of Tekmart signed the letter on October 27 without making any changes to it and sent it back to Megabyte by first class mail. The next day, having not heard from Tekmart, Megabyte's sales manager contacted the president of Tekmart and informed him that, if Tekmart accepted by the end of the month, it would receive a $1 \\%$ discount in the total price. When Tekmart's president responded that he had already sent the acceptance, the sales manager assured him that the discount would still apply. On October 31, Tekmart received a circular from Dataco offering comparable diskettes for $5 \\%$ less than Megabyte's price. The president of Tekmart immediately faxed a rejection to Megabyte. Megabyte received the rejection immediately but took no action on it. The next day, November 1, Megabyte received the signed contract from Tekmart. What is the status of the agreement between the parties?\n",
      "An enforceable contract was formed for $ 9,900$ because Tekmart accepted before October 31 and needed no additional consideration for the oral modification.\n",
      "An enforceable contract was formed for $ 10,000$ because the parol evidence rule precludes Tekmart from offering evidence of the telephone conversation.\n",
      "An enforceable contract was formed for $ 10,000$ because, even though Tekmart accepted before October 31 , the Statute of Frauds makes the oral modification between the parties unenforceable.\n",
      "An enforceable contract was not formed between the parties because Tekmart's rejection was received before its acceptance. \n",

      "Tommy was in his third year of college, and Tommy's father, Dad, often sent Tommy money to help Tommy pay for books and for living expenses. During the last winter break, Tommy brought his girlfriend Gidget home to meet his family. Dad took an instant dislike to Gidget, and has continually lectured Tommy about her, insisting that Tommy could find someone \"more refined\" to date.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early March, Tommy telephoned Dad from College Village, where the university was located. Tommy asked Dad for $ 1,000$. Dad told Tommy, \"I'll send you the thousand bucks, but if you don't find a classier girlfriend than that Gidget person, this is the last subsidy you'll get from me, young man.\" Tommy thanked Dad, and promptly went to a jeweler with Gidget, where Tommy and Gidget selected an engagement ring priced at $ 5,000$. Tommy, who was 21 years of age, signed a contract to purchase the ring. The contract required Tommy to make a $1,000 down payment and then to make a series of installment payments. Tommy planned to use the $ 1,000$ check he was expecting from Dad for the down payment. Tommy and Gidget both worked at part-time, minimum wage jobs while they attended school. Through a friend who lived in College Village, Dad discovered Tommy's plan to buy Gidget an expensive engagement ring. Dad refused to send Tommy the $ 1,000$ check. The jeweler is now demanding that Tommy make the $ 1,000$ down payment on the ring and pay the first installment as well. Can Tommy legally enforce Dad's promise to send Tommy $ 1,000$ ?\n",
      "Yes, because Tommy relied on Dad's promise and the doctrine of promissory estoppel applies.\n",
      "Yes, because Tommy was an intended beneficiary.\n",
      "No, because Dad's promise was a gift unsupported by consideration.\n",
      "No, because Dad did not promise to send the money with the expectation of inducing Tommy to buy an engagement ring for Gidget. \n",

Dorothy and her husband, Hank, often brought Melissa, a divorcee, along on vacations and dining engagements. One day, however, after being tipped off by a mutual friend, Dorothy went through Hank's drawer and discovered steamy love letters to him from Melissa. The tone of the letters made it obvious that Hank and Melissa had been having an affair for at least three years. Dorothy became furious, but kept repeating to herself, \"Don't get mad, get even!\" She purchased a handgun and waited for the right moment to use it. The moment occurred at a large outdoor barbecue celebrating Melissa's birthday. At the barbecue, Dorothy gave the gun to Melissa's 10-year-old nephew, Sammy. She told Sammy, \"Why don't you go up and point this gun at your Auntie Melissa. When you pull the trigger a sign will come out saying, 'BANG! and Happy Birthday,' just like in the circus.\" Sammy took the gun, pointed it at Melissa, and pulled the trigger. However, Sammy's aim was faulty, and when the gun discharged the bullet struck Hank, killing him. The police quickly linked Dorothy to the crime.\n",

Howard arrived home and let himself into the house. He heard noises from the bedroom and, upon investigation, Howard was shocked to find his wife, Chastity, in bed with Nick, a good friend of Howard, who lived four blocks away. Nick dressed quickly and took off out the back door. Howard screamed a number of epithets at Chastity and then told her, \"Nick's going to pay for this! Get me a drink! It will give me the steadiness to do what I have to do to avenge my honor.\" A frightened Chastity brought Howard a bourbon and water. Howard drank it quickly and demanded yet another drink. After consuming several more drinks, Howard unlocked the closet, pulled out a rifle, and loaded it. He then set off for Nick's house.\n",

Howard stood silently listening to Nick, but he kept the gun trained on his erstwhile friend. Suddenly, Nick pulled a switchblade knife from his pocket. As the metal flashed, Howard fired a single shot at Nick. The bullet struck him in the middle of the forehead and Nick died instantly. Howard set the gun down, fell to his knees, and began crying.

For over two months, Victor pleaded with Dana, \"Please kill me and put me out of my misery. I'm in such terrible pain.

One Saturday afternoon, Dana paid her usual visit to Victor. His pleading was as heartrending as ever. With a tender expression on her face, Dana pulled a small revolver from her purse.

As Officer Smith issued a speeding citation to Doofus, her partner, Jones, fed the license plate numbers into the police computer. It turned out that the Belchfire had been very recently reported as stolen. Doofus was unable to produce satisfactory registration papers and was arrested for car theft. At the police station, Smith gave Doofus the standard Miranda warnings, and Doofus agreed to answer Smith's questions regarding a local \"chop-shop\" network, which arranged for the theft of expensive automobiles so that they could be cut up for parts. After a while, Jones suggested, \"Let's break for lunch.\" He and Smith escorted Doofus to a nearby cafeteria. During the course of their lunch, which lasted about an hour, Smith noticed that Doofus, who was otherwise rather shabbily dressed, was wearing an obviously expensive \"Xelor\" watch. Upon their return to the station, and without giving any new Miranda warnings, Smith resumed interrogation of Doofus. She asked Doofus about a recent home invasion in the swank \"Notting Hill\" neighborhood, where a quantity of valuable jewelry, including a \"Xelor\" watch, was taken. Doofus thereupon confessed to the home invasion, and was indicted on the home invasion charge, a felony under the jurisdiction's modern criminal code.\n",

      "Dassent was on trial on a hit and run charge, whereby the prosecution asserts that, while driving his vehicle, Dassent struck and injured Proctor, an elderly pedestrian, and then sped away from the scene of the accident without stopping to assess Proctor's injuries or to render assistance. During the prosecution's presentation of its case, three eyewitnesses testified that the car that struck Proctor had the license plate number DASS 53. A witness from the State Department of Motor Vehicles produced records showing that a vehicle with license number DASS 53 was registered in Dassent's name and that Dassent claimed on his driver's license application that he was born in 1953.\n",

He admitted that a car meeting the description of the vehicle given by the eyewitnesses and bearing a license plate with the number DASS 53 belonged to him, but Dassent denied having driven the vehicle on the day that Proctor was injured. Without releasing Dassent as a witness, his lawyer called Father White, an Episcopal priest, to the stand. White is ready to testify that he has known Dassent for 12 years, that Dassent has performed many charitable acts, and that Dassent is a highly responsible person \"who would not run away from his obligations by leaving the scene of an accident.\"\n",

The excuse given him was that the reorganization and merger required a trimming of personnel to make the corporation \"lean and mean.\" Shortly after Gray's dismissal, Frogman, a member of the board of directors of Macho, who had always liked Gray and admired his competent work, told Gray, \"I think what happened to you was rotten, and I want you to know I voted against it, but Cobb, as chairman of the board, took most of the directors with him when he made a point at the reorganization meeting to say, 'Now's our chance to get rid of old Gray, who just doesn't fit our corporate image of youthful vigor.\"' Gray, who was 60 years old, filed an age discrimination suit against Macho. It was typical practice that all directors' meetings be tape recorded, and that the corporate secretary use the tape recording to type up a formal transcript of the proceedings.

Dora tried to get Magnolia to leave Redacre, but Magnolia told Dora, \"Redacre is mine until I die, and you'd better get used to that idea.\" Since Magnolia took up residence on Redacre, she has been sent two county property tax bills, which she has refused to pay. The county is now threatening to bring an action to force a judicial sale of Redacre to cover the tax deficiency. Dora files an appropriate suit asking the court to evict Magnolia from Redacre and to compel her to pay the taxes for her period of occupancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court will rule that:\n",
      "Magnolia has a life estate in Redacre for the period of her own life, and Magnolia must pay the taxes on the property.\n",
      "Magnolia has a life estate in Redacre for the period of Nelson's life, and Magnolia must pay the taxes on the property.\n",
      "Magnolia has a life estate in Redacre for the period of Nelson's life, but Magnolia does not have to pay the taxes on the property, because taxes are the responsibility of the remainder grantee.\n",
      "Dora owns Redacre, because Nelson could not convey his interest to Magnolia.\n",

Dwight obtained a two-year lease from Miller on one of the stores. Dwight then opened a gift and greeting card shop which he named \"Happy Times Cards and Gifts.\" Dwight's business was quite successful, and he was making good profits from the store's operation when he underwent a religious conversion and decided that the true meaning of life was not to be found in the quest for material success. Dwight spoke with his friend, Ariel, who was anxious to go into business for herself. Ariel wished to buy Dwight's business and inventory, and Dwight wished to assign his lease on the store in Miller's Mall to Ariel. The lease still had 14 months left to run. Dwight told Miller that he wanted to assign his lease to Ariel, who would run the same kind of business. Miller took out his copy of the lease and pointed out a clause requiring consent to any assignment and providing that any attempted assignment without consent is grounds for terminating the lease. Miller refused to consent to the assignment. Dwight assigned the lease to Ariel anyway; then he went off to meditate under the direction of a famed guru who operated an ashram high in the Himalayas. Ariel operated the card store in the same manner as Dwight, the only difference being a change of the store's name to \"Happier Days Cards and Gifts.\"\n",

      "Dan, an experienced trial lawyer, traveled from his hometown, Secondville, to Capitol City, where he was hired to complete a complex antitrust case that Dan estimated would take weeks, and possibly months, to complete. During his sojourn in Capitol City, which began on a Sunday, Dan stayed at the Capitol City Ryott Hotel. The normal room charges were $ 150$ per night. Dan made a deal with the hotel management to pay $ 700$ per week for his room for an indefinite period. Dan never told the hotel management exactly how long he planned to stay, but each Sunday he would present the cashier with a check for $ 700$, plus any additional taxes and room charges, to pay for the previous week's lodging. Dan was not asked to pay in this manner, but he did it as a matter of custom. Dan did this for four weeks, and then the opposing party suddenly made a generous settlement offer which Dan's client agreed to accept. On a Thursday morning, before checkout time for that day, Dan tendered the hotel cashier a check for $ 400$ plus additional charges incurred from Sunday through Wednesday nights. The cashier promptly took the check and then told Dan, \"You owe us $ 1,000$ plus taxes for 10 more days' lodging. We expect you to pay for the rest of this week as you customarily do, and then for an additional week because you didn't give us a week's notice that you planned to vacate.\" Dan refused to pay the additional charges.

      "The above chart indicates the configuration of three parcels of property located in State Blue, which has a 15-year prescription and adverse possession period. Seventeen years ago, Wallace purchased Woodlot, which is adjacent to Smoothacre and Roughacre. At the time Wallace purchased Woodlot, he asked Arnold, the owner of Smoothacre, if Arnold would grant Wallace an easement to use the paved way across Smoothacre to haul logs to the public road. Arnold was an affable person and he readily granted the easement to Wallace. Wallace paid nothing for the easement, and the deed granting the easement was properly recorded in the office of the county recorder of deeds. For six months Wallace hauled $\\operatorname{logs}$ across Smoothacre. However, Wallace decided it would be easier to haul the logs over Roughacre, because the distance to the public road was less using that route. Wallace negotiated with Brenda, the owner of Roughacre, and Brenda granted Wallace a license to haul logs on the gravel road across Roughacre to the public road. Wallace paid Brenda a modest annual fee for this privilege. In the intervening time period, Wallace never used the paved way across Smoothacre for any purpose. Six months ago, Arnold conveyed Smoothacre to Cyd, and two weeks ago, Cyd had a chain-link fence built around the perimeter of Smoothacre which, of course, blocked Wallace's access to the paved way crossing Smoothacre. One week ago, acting within her rights, Brenda revoked Wallace's license to use the gravel road crossing Roughacre. The next day, Wallace told Cyd, \"Open up that chainlink fence where Smoothacre abuts Woodlot, because I have an easement to haul my logs across your paved way.\" Cyd replied, \"Forget it, Buster. I never agreed to any easement, and I don't want you hauling logs across my property.\" Wallace seeks advice about his rights in the easement across Smoothacre.\n",

Seymour never bothered to visit the property. Meanwhile, back in State Black, Michael noticed that Blackacre was now unoccupied. Not one to miss an opportunity, Michael leased Blackacre to Theresa. The lease was in writing and Theresa agreed to pay Michael an annual rent, which she always did promptly. Theresa had been leasing Blackacre from Michael for 15 years, when Seymour took a trip to State Black and decided to take a look at Blackacre. Upon discovering Theresa's occupancy, Seymour filed suit to quiet title, joining Michael in the action.

Seeing no other way out, he decided to sell Cattlefork, a distant ranch that had been in his family for generations, to his childhood nemesis, Astro. Not wanting to lose control of the family property forever, Oiler inserted a provision in the deed to Astro binding \"Astro, his heirs, and assigns\" to offer \"Oiler, his heirs, and assigns\" the right of first refusal to purchase Cattlefork when it was offered for sale. Astro was not happy with the provision, but Oiler refused to sell the property without the covenant included. Astro reluctantly agreed. Cattlefork was conveyed to Astro, and the deed containing the right of first refusal was duly recorded.\n",

Therefore, Astro devised a stratagem to get around the covenant. When informed that Cowboy was interested in buying the property, Astro decided to execute his plan. Astro's friend Ranger agreed to act as a \"straw man\" to avoid the consequences of the covenant. Astro deeded Cattlefork as a \"gift\" to Ranger. Ranger recorded the deed, which did not contain the right of first refusal covenant, and Ranger then sold the land to Cowboy for $ 200,000$, giving the proceeds of the sale to Astro. Cowboy knew nothing about the right of first refusal because he inspected only Ranger's deed from Astro. When Oiler learned of what had happened, he filed suit to compel conveyance of the land to him. To back up his words, Oiler produced a $ 200,000$ letter of credit.

On his 75 th birthday, he conveyed Forestacre to his two nephews, Pelt and Dash, who were members of the local hunting club. The deed was a general warranty deed stating that the property was conveyed in fee simple absolute. A few days later, Dash had a serious dispute with Pelt and the other members of the hunting club, and he quit the club. Torrens then executed a written agreement with Pelt stating that the conveyance of Forestacre to Pelt and Dash was in trust for the benefit of the local hunting club for a period of ten years, with Pelt and Dash as trustees, and then to Pelt and Dash in fee simple. Several months later, Torrens died. When the next hunting season drew near, Pelt told Dash that members of the hunting club were once again planning to hunt on the property.

After she reached retirement age, Oralee sold the property to Amber, who financed the purchase with a note secured by a 20 -year mortgage with Maritime Bank. Amber promptly recorded her deed, and for 20 years Amber promptly made every payment to the bank. During that period of time, Amber financed the purchase of three automobiles with loans from Maritime Bank, and her record of payment was exemplary. Five years after Amber had paid off the mortgage, she revisited the mortgage loan department of Maritime Bank. She told the loan officer that she wanted to borrow $ 30,000$ to help pay for the medical school education of a favorite niece, securing the loan with a mortgage on Blackacre. After confirming Amber's continuing employment status, the bank officer quickly approved the loan based upon Amber's excellent record with the bank. On June 3, Amber executed the note and the mortgage, and the bank gave Amber a certified check for $ 30,000$, which she immediately deposited in her account at National Bank. On June 4, Amber sold Blackacre to Brittany for $ 150,000$. Brittany, a wealthy actress and film director, paid Amber in cash. Brittany knew nothing about the mortgage. On June 5, Brittany recorded her deed to Blackacre. Two hours after Brittany recorded, Amber closed out her account at National Bank, which included the $ 30,000$ from the mortgage.

The mortgage contained a \"due-on-sale clause,\" requiring the mortgagor to pay off the mortgage at the time the property is sold. Burt made all of his mortgage payments in a timely manner. Five years after Burt purchased Sweetacre, he sold the property to Tully. Burt told Tully that there was a mortgage on the property but he did not mention the due-on-sale clause. Tully paid Burt the asking price for Sweetacre. Burt pocketed the proceeds without paying off the First Bank mortgage.\n",

      "When Able purchased Blueacre from Oswald, he took out a $ 160,000$ mortgage on Blueacre. After being in possession of Blueacre for six months, Able concluded that his cash-flow situation would make it difficult for him to continue to make the high monthly mortgage payments. Therefore, he sold Blueacre to Brett. According to the terms of the agreement signed by the parties, Brett took Blueacre \"subject to the mortgage\" and agreed to \"assume payment of' the mortgage. A recession struck the area, and Brett soon found himself in financial difficulties. Brett sold Blueacre to Carly. Under the terms of the agreement signed by the parties, Carly agreed to take \"subject to the mortgage.\" All deeds and the mortgage were properly recorded. After two months on the land, Carly ceased making mortgage payments. Third National Bank (\"TNB\"), holder of the mortgage, unsuccessfully demanded payments from Carly, Brett, and Able. TNB properly instituted proceedings to foreclose, and Blueacre was put up for judicial sale. Because the recession had severely depressed property values, Blueacre sold for only $ 120,000$. After the $ 120,000$ was applied to the mortgage, $ 37,800$ was still owing on the principal amount. TNB now seeks judgment to cover the $ 37,800$ deficiency.

      "Augustus received an \"inside tip\" from his friend Drusus, a real estate developer. Acting on the tip, Augustus purchased several acres of scrub-covered land of little apparent value. Shortly thereafter, Whizny World, an international conglomerate, announced plans to develop a theme park to be called \"Romeland\" on a tract immediately adjacent to Augustus's scrubland. The Whizny World plan caused real estate values in the surrounding area to skyrocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Augustus could have sold his land for a price many times greater than the purchase price, but Augustus decided that he would use the land to build a variety of tourist-oriented facilities. In order to finance his project, Augustus went to Brutus Bank (\"Brubank\") and took out a $ 20,000$ mortgage on his land. Brubank promptly recorded the mortgage. A few days later, Augustus went to Cassius Bank (\"Casbank\") and took out a $ 15,000$ mortgage on the land. Casbank had known of the Brubank mortgage, and Casbank promptly recorded its own mortgage. A few weeks after that, Augustus reviewed his plans and decided that he needed more money to make his proposed tourist facilities more \"upscale.\" Augustus went back to Brubank and, after full disclosure of the Casbank mortgage, asked the loan officer if he could receive another advance of $ 15,000$ from the original Brubank mortgage. The loan officer readily agreed, processed the loan, and increased the amount borrowed against the mortgage from $ 20,000$ to $ 35,000$. Brubank promptly recorded the change. Augustus quickly spent most of his available funds on retainers for architects, builders, and attorneys. He was shocked to read in the paper that the County Council summarily rejected the Whizny World proposal, acceding to the arguments of community activists and environmentalists that the economic benefits from the theme park would be outweighed by the deleterious effects on the natural beauty and tranquility of the area. Augustus made no more mortgage payments to Casbank, but continued to make payments to Brubank. The value of the land plummeted, and Casbank brought a foreclosure action against Augustus and included Brubank as a party. At the foreclosure sale, the proceeds were a mere $ 18,000$ after attorneys' fees and court costs.\n",

Dietz had a long history of mental illness and had been in and out of institutions since he was an adolescent. Although Dietz would improve for a while, he was subject to recurrent hallucinations and delusions involving a belief that people, animals, and alien beings from another planet were about to attack him. Pansy was peacefully walking along a quiet residential street in Kirbyville. It happened to be the same street as that along which Dietz was walking. Pansy noticed that a person was walking up the street on the sidewalk towards her, but she did not know Dietz.

Knowing where Paul, a creature of habit, always kept his lunch box, she put a small quantity of mescaline, a synthetic hallucinogen, in Paul's thermos bottle of cranberry juice. She expected that strait-laced Paul would have a minor vision or two and act in a goofy and comical manner. However, when Paul drank his mescaline-laced juice at lunchtime he had a severe reaction to the mescaline and experienced wild hallucinations. Donnalou promptly drove Paul to the emergency room of nearby Hacksaw Hospital. Paul was put under observation for a couple of hours. The emergency room physician, Pillpush, was very busy and negligently released Paul prematurely. The next day, while driving, Paul had another powerful hallucination and drove his car into a bridge abutment. Paul suffered contusions, abrasions, a concussion, and several broken bones. After Paul recovered he sued Donnalou for his injuries.\n",

On his way back, the boat was struck and seriously damaged by a large tree that fell from the bank without warning. Randy managed to bring the boat back to his house. Just as he got in, Steve called, demanding to know why Randy had not brought it back when he was supposed to.

Boy had to be rushed to the hospital, and although Boy recovered, Mommy has suffered feelings of anxiety, worrying that her child might be injured again. Mommy's husband, Hal, talked Mommy into going to a movie to have a relaxing evening out. She agreed after her mother agreed to watch Boy for the evening. Mommy was enjoying the movie when Hal left his seat to get some popcorn from the concession stand. Hal ordered a large popcorn with extra butter. While handling change, Dizzie, the concession stand attendant, carelessly dropped a quarter into Hal's popcorn. After taking a couple of handfuls for himself, Hal returned to his seat and gave the popcorn box to Mommy. Mommy began to eat the popcorn. However, as she began to munch her third handful of popcorn, she bit the quarter that Dizzie had dropped into the box. Mommy did not swallow the quarter, nor did she bite on it hard enough to injure her teeth or gums, but the feel of the coin brought back all her anxieties about Boy's injury. That night Mommy could not sleep, and the few times that she did nod off for a second, a horrible nightmare recalling her son's injury because of the coin would occur.\n",

One such afternoon, Hobby saw a squirrel and suddenly bolted away from Hound's lawn.

      "State Green had a law on its statute books that made any teacher, guardian, therapist, school administrator, or any other person standing in loco parentis subject to the same rights and duties as actual parents. In effect this meant that persons standing in loco parentis could be charged with liability in cases where a parent would have been liable and granted immunity from liability where such would have been the case for a parent. Dr. Zarkov had a Ph.D. in child psychology and was the director of the Verdant Institute, a residential home for disturbed minors located in Verdant City, the largest city in State Green. The Verdant Institute had no fence surrounding its premises, but regular bedchecks were conducted each night to determine that all of the disturbed children were present. A bedcheck determined that Ming, a 12-year-old resident of the Institute, was absent. In fact, Ming had climbed out a window and run away about 15 minutes before the bedcheck. The security guard who conducted the bedcheck immediately reported to Zarkov that Ming was missing. Zarkov did not report Ming's absence to the police or any other authority. Thirty-six hours after Ming ran away from the Institute, Ming savagely beat and severely injured six-year-old Gordon, a child who lived a few blocks away from the Verdant Institute.

The first night that Jason stayed there, however, a fire swept through the house. Jason managed to escape with a broken ankle and some minor burns, but the house was a total loss. An investigation by the fire marshal established that the fire started from a short in some wiring behind a wall.

      "Ten years ago Gasmask Chemicals, a leading chemical manufacturer, decided that it needed a safe place to store byproduct waste from its manufacturing processes. Many of these byproducts were highly toxic; thus, Gasmask took great care in selecting a dump site. A highly reputable engineering company was hired and an exhaustive survey was performed. Finally the Temblor Canyon site was selected and the chemicals were stored there underground, using state-of-the-art techniques. Although the survey and attendant geological soundings were performed with consummate skill, the surveyors failed to discover a crack in the rock of the storage area that was too small for their instruments to detect. Over a period of years the chemicals began to seep through the crack and into the water table below the surface. Scientists in nearby Canyon City discovered that the city's water supply, all of which came from local wells that tapped into the water table, contained unacceptably high levels of chemical contaminants. Canyon City was required to spend $ 5$ million on a complex filtration system to remove the dangerous chemicals from its water.\n",

      "Neither the legislature nor the courts of State Yellow have abolished the common law tort defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. However, the State Yellow legislature decided it was time to take steps against all forms of drug abuse and passed the Omnibus Anti-Drug Act (\"OADA\"). One of the OADA provisions forbade the selling of airplane glue to anyone under the age of 18 except in small quantities in prepackaged model kits. Violation of the statute was penalized by fines or, in cases of multiple violations, possible imprisonment. OADA also required that all elementary and secondary schools licensed by the state provide comprehensive drug education programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Primrose was a 14-year-old resident of State Yellow. Primrose had experienced the drug education program in his school, as mandated by OADA. One of the units in the program covered the dangers of glue sniffing. Primrose understood the anti-drug instruction, but he enjoyed the \"high\" he got from sniffing glue when he constructed model airplanes, and he wanted to experience more of it. He went to Daffodil's Hobby \\& Craft Shop to purchase a large tube of airplane glue. Daffodil, sole proprietor of the hobby shop, sold the large tube of glue to Primrose. Primrose went home, hid in the garage, and sniffed the glue. His parents found Primrose in a coma on the garage floor. Although Primrose will survive, physicians have told his parents that he suffered permanent brain damage from sniffing the glue.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Primrose's behalf, the parents filed suit against Daffodil, which should result in a verdict: \n",
      "For Daffodil, because Primrose was aware of the danger when he sniffed the glue.\n",
      "For Daffodil, because Primrose is not a member of the class of persons meant to be protected by OADA.\n",
      "For Primrose, because Daffodil violated OADA when he sold the glue to Primrose.\n",
      "For Primrose, unless Primrose could reasonably have been mistaken for an 18 year-old by Daffodil.\n",
