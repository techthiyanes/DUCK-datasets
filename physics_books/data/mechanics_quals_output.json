At this position, the attractions of $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are balanced.\n\nConsider now a small displacement being applied to $m_{3}$ at this stationary position. If the displacement is along the line joining $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, say toward $m_{1}$, the attraction by $m_{1}$ is enhanced and that by $m_{2}$ is reduced. Then $m_{3}$ will continue to move toward $m_{1}$ and the equilibrium is unstable. On the other hand, if the displacement is normal to the line joining $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, both the attractions by $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ will have a component toward the stationary position and will restore $m_{3}$ to this position. Thus the equilibrium is stable. Therefore the equilibrium is stable against a transverse perturbation but unstable against a longitudinal one.",

Let the pressure and density in the latter region be $p$ and $\\rho$ respectively. When the particles enter the compressed area, their velocity changes to $v+d v$, pressure changes to $p+d p$, and density changes to $\\rho+d \\rho$, as shown in Fig. 1.247.

In this frame, the electron and positron will move in a straight line passing through the origin away from each other with the same speed $v$ and the total momentum in zero. Conservation of momentum requires that the momentum of the original photon is also zero.

Hence the reaction is not possible.\n\nEnergy and momentum can both be conserved if another particle, say a nucleus of mass $M$, is involved.

        "Problem Statement": "The principle of equivalence asserts that gravitational and inertial masses are equal. Does a photon have nonzero gravitational mass? Explain. Suppose a photon is falling toward the earth and it falls a distance of $10 \\mathrm{~m}$. Calculate the effect on the frequency of the photon. What experimental technique could be used to measure this frequency change?",
        "Solution": "The gravitational mass of a photon is not zero but is equal to the inertial mass\n\n$$\nm=\\frac{E}{c^{2}}=\\frac{h \\nu}{c^{2}},\n$$\n\nin accordance with the principle of equivalence, even though its rest mass is zero. When the photon falls a distance $l$ in a gravitational field g, its energy increases and so does its frequency: \n\n$$\nh \\nu^{\\prime} \\approx h \\nu+m g l=h \\nu\\left(1+\\frac{g l}{c^{2}}\\right) .\n$$\n\nWriting $\\nu^{\\prime}=\\nu+\\Delta \\nu$, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\nu}{\\nu} \\approx \\frac{g l}{c^{2}}=\\frac{9.8 \\times 10}{\\left(3 \\times 10^{8}\\right)^{2}}=1.1 \\times 10^{-15} .\n$$\n\nThus falling through a distance of $10 \\mathrm{~m}$ in the gravitational field of the earth, the frequency of a photon will increase (blue shift) by a factor $1+1.1 \\times 10^{-15}$. The slight increase in frequency can be detected experimentally using the M\u00f6ssbauer effect.",
