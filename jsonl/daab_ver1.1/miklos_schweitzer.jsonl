{"Topic": "algebra", "Book": "Miklos Schweitzer Competitions", "Problem Statement": "Determine the roots of unity in the field of $p$-adic numbers.", "Answer Candidates": [], "Images": [], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "The $p$-adic number $a_{-m} p^{-m}+\\cdots+a_{-1} p^{-1}+a_{0}+a_{1} p+\\cdots+$ $a_{n} p^{n}+\\cdots \\quad\\left(0 \\leqslant a_{i}<p\\right)$ is a $p$-adic integer iff all the coefficients with negative index are equal to 0 , and it is a unit in the ring of $p$-adic integers iff furthermore $a_{0} \\neq 0$. It is clear that every $p$-adic number $\\alpha$ can be written in the form $\\alpha=\\beta p^{r}$, where $\\beta$ is a $p$-adic unit and $r$ an integer. Since the product of $p$-adic units is again a $p$-adic unit, we deduce that a $p$-adic number can be a root of unity only in the case when it is a $p$-adic unit.\n\nEvery root of unity can be written in the form $\\varepsilon=a+\\alpha p^{r}$, where $r$ is a positive integer, $\\alpha$ is a $p$-adic unit, and $0<a<p$. Now if $\\varepsilon^{n}=1$, then $a^{n} \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$ holds true. So the exponent of $a$ is a divisor of $n$.\n\nConsider the case $p \\neq 2$. Let $\\exp (a)=k$; we are going to show $k=n$. Let $\\beta=\\varepsilon^{k}$, and suppose $\\beta \\neq 1$. Then $\\beta$ is of the form $\\beta=1+\\gamma p^{s}$, where $\\gamma$ is a $p$-adic unit. If $k \\neq n$ were the case, then some power of $\\beta$ would be 1. To show the impossibility of this, it is enough to show that a power with prime exponent of a number of the form $\\beta=1+\\gamma p^{s}$ ( $\\gamma$ a $p$-adic unit) cannot be 1. Let $q$ be a prime number; using the binomial theorem, we get\n\n$$\n\\beta^{q}=1+q \\gamma p^{s}+\\delta p^{2 s}=1+\\varphi p^{s} \\quad \\text { if } q \\neq p\n$$\n\nwhile in the case $q=p$, using $p>2$ we get\n\n$$\n\\beta^{p}=1+\\gamma p^{s+1}+\\delta p^{2 s+1}=1+\\varphi p^{s+1},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is a $p$-adic integer, whereas $\\varphi$, as we can easily see, is a $p$-adic unit. This guarantees that $\\beta^{q}$ is different from 1 . We have proved that in the field of $p$-adic numbers every root of unity is necessarily a $(p-1)$ th root of unity. Now we show that such roots of unity indeed exist.\n\nLet $g_{0}$ be a primitive root of unity $\\bmod p$. We are going to prove that it is possible to determine numbers $0 \\leqslant a_{i}<p$ in such a way that the $p$-adic number\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=g_{0}+a_{1} p+\\cdots+a_{n} p^{n}+\\cdots\n$$\n\nshould be a $(p-1)$ th primitive root of unity. It is clear that any power of $\\varepsilon$ with exponent less than $p-1$ is different from 1. So it is enough to show that for a suitable choice of the numbers $a_{j}$, the natural numbers $g_{j}=g_{0}+a_{1} p+\\cdots+a_{j} p^{j}$ satisfy $g_{j}^{p-1} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{j+1}\\right)$. This will be proved by induction. For $j=0$ the statement is true, as $g_{0}$ is a primitive root. Suppose that the statement holds for some $j$, that is,\n\n$$\ng_{j}^{p-1}=1+c_{j} p^{j+1}\n$$\n\nLet $a_{j+1}$ be the solution of the congruence $g_{0} x \\equiv c_{j}(\\bmod p)$. Then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ng_{j+1}^{p-1} & \\equiv\\left(g_{j}+a_{j+1} p^{j+1}\\right)^{p-1} \\equiv 1+c_{j} p^{j+1}-g_{j} a_{j+1} p^{j+1} \\\\\n& \\equiv 1+\\left(c_{j}-g_{j} a_{j+1}\\right) p^{j+1} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{j+2}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore $\\varepsilon$ and its powers are different $(p-1)$ th roots of unity; their number is $p-1$. There can be no other roots of unity since the polynomial $x^{p-1}-1$ can have at most $p-1$ roots in a commutative field.\n\nLet us now deal with the case $p=2$. Similarly to the case of odd prime numbers, we can prove that a power with an odd exponent of a dyadic number of the form $1+\\cdots$ can be 1 only in case the number itself is 1 . So if a dyadic number is a primitive $n$-th root of unity then $n$ can have no odd prime divisors. There are two second roots of unity, 1 and the number $-1=1+2+2^{2}+\\cdots 2^{r}+\\cdots$ as well. There can be no more second roots of unity, because the polynomial $x^{2}-1$ can have at most two roots in a commutative field.\n\nWe show that there are no other roots of unity in the field of dyadic numbers. Suppose there were another root of unity; then this would be necessarily a primitive root of unity belonging to some power of 2 , so there would surely exist a primitive further root of unity, that is, a dyadic number $\\eta$ with $\\eta^{2}=-1$. Clearly, $\\eta$ must have the form $\\eta=1+2^{r}+\\cdots$, where $r \\geqslant 1$. This gives\n\n$$\n-1 \\equiv\\left(1+2^{r}\\right)^{2} \\equiv 1+2^{r+1}+2^{2 r} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{r+2}\\right) .\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n-2 \\equiv 2^{r+1}+2^{2 r} \\quad(\\bmod 4), \\quad \\text { that is, } 2^{r}+2^{2 r-1} \\equiv 1 \\quad(\\bmod 2),\n$$\n\nwhich is clearly impossible. This concludes the proof.\n\nProblem A.2. Let $A$ and $B$ be two Abelian groups, and define the sum of two homomorphisms $\\eta$ and $\\chi$ from $A$ to $B$ by\n\n$$\na(\\eta+\\chi)=a \\eta+a \\chi \\quad \\text { for all } a \\in A .\n$$\n\nWith this addition, the set of homomorphisms from $A$ to $B$ forms an Abelian group $H$. Suppose now that $A$ is a $p$-group ( $p$ a prime number). Prove that in this case $H$ becomes a topological group under the topology defined by taking the subgroups $p^{k} H(k=1,2, \\ldots)$ as a neighborhood base of 0 . Prove that $H$ is complete in this topology and that every connected component of $H$ consists of a single element. When is $H$ compact in this topology?\n\nSolution. $H$ is clearly a commutative group whose 0 element is the homomorphism mapping every element of $A$ to $0 \\in B$, and for $\\eta \\in H,-\\eta$ is the mapping defined by $a(-\\eta)=-a \\eta$.\n\nTo prove that $H$ is a topological group, we have to check the following:\n\n(i) The intersection of the neighborhoods of 0 is 0 alone. Suppose namely that $\\eta \\in p^{k} H(k=1,2, \\ldots)$. As $A$ is a $p$-group, the order of any $a \\in A$ is of the form $p^{n}$ for some $n$ depending on $a$. Because $\\eta \\in p^{n} H$, we have $\\eta=p^{n} \\chi$ for some $\\chi \\in H$, and so\n\n$$\na \\eta=a\\left(p^{n} \\chi\\right)=\\left(p^{n} a\\right) \\chi=0 \\chi=0\n$$\n\nproving $\\eta=0$.\n\n(ii) To any neighborhood $U$ of 0 there is a neighborhood $V$ of 0 such that $V+(-V) \\subseteq U$, a suitable choice being $V=U$.\n\n(iii) If $a$ is contained in some neighborhood $U$ of 0 , then there exists a neighborhood $V$ of 0 such that $a+V \\subseteq U$. Again the choice $V=U$ will do.\n\n(iv) The intersection of any two neighborhoods of 0 contains a neighborhood of 0 , because for any two neighborhoods, one of them contains the other.\n\nWe now come to the proof of completeness. We have to prove that if $\\eta_{1}, \\eta_{2}, \\ldots, \\eta_{n}, \\ldots$ is a Cauchy sequence, then it converges to some element of $H$. By repeating members of the sequence, if necessary, we can assume that $\\eta_{i+1}-\\eta_{i} \\in p^{i} H$, that is, $\\eta_{i+1}=\\eta_{i}+p^{i} \\vartheta_{i}$. Furthermore, define $\\eta_{0}$ as 0.\n\nNow define mappings $\\chi_{i}(i=0,1,2, \\ldots)$ in the following way:\n\nIf the order of $a \\in A$ is $p^{k}$ then let\n\n$$\na \\chi_{i}=a\\left(\\vartheta_{i}+p \\vartheta_{i+1}+\\cdots+p^{k-1} \\vartheta_{i+k-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt is easy to check that $\\chi_{i}$ is indeed a homomorphism from $A$ to $B$ and\n\n$$\n\\chi_{i}=\\vartheta_{i}+p \\chi_{i+1} .\n$$\n\nWe will show that the limit of the sequence $\\eta_{0}, \\eta_{1}, \\ldots, \\eta_{n}, \\ldots$ is $\\chi_{0}$. For this it is enough to show $\\chi_{0}-\\eta_{i} \\in p^{i} H$, actually $\\chi_{0}-\\eta_{i}=p^{i} \\chi_{i}$, which we prove by induction. For $i=0$, we have $\\chi_{0}-\\eta_{0}=\\chi_{0}-0=p^{0} \\chi_{0}$. Using our previous observations and the induction hypothesis, we have\n\n$$\n\\chi_{0}-\\eta_{i+1}=\\chi_{0}-\\eta_{i}-p^{i} \\vartheta_{i}=p^{i} \\chi_{i}-p^{i} \\vartheta_{i}=p^{i}\\left(\\chi_{i}-\\vartheta_{i}\\right)=p^{i+1} \\chi_{i+1},\n$$\n\nproving the completeness of $H$. We now prove that the connected component of 0 consists of 0 alone; to prove this, it is enough to show that the intersection of all open-closed sets containing 0 is 0 . As $p^{k} H$ is an open subgroup, it is closed as well, and as the intersection of all of them (for $k=1,2, \\ldots$ ) is already 0 alone, we get the desired result.\n\nFor compactness we are going to prove the following result: $H$ is compact if and only if the index of $p^{k} H$ in $H$ is finite for every $k$.\n\nNecessity of this condition is easy to establish: the cosets $\\chi+p^{k} H(\\chi \\in$ $H$ ) cover $H$. If $H$ is compact, then already a finite number of them have to cover $H$, which is precisely what the condition says.\n\nSuppose now that all the subgroups $p^{k} H$ have finite index. We are going to show that if a family of closed subsets of $H$ has the property that any finite number of them have a nonempty intersection, then the whole family has a nonempty intersection.\n\nFirst, we show the following: let $U_{\\lambda}(\\lambda \\in \\Lambda)$ be subsets of the set $H$ such that the intersection of any finite number of them is nonempty. Suppose that $H$ is the disjoint union of two subsets $S$ and $T$. Then at least one of the families $S \\cap U_{\\lambda}(\\lambda \\in \\Lambda)$ and $T \\cap U_{\\lambda}(\\lambda \\in \\Lambda)$ inherits the same intersection property. (In particular, either $S$ or $T$ meets all the $\\left.U_{\\lambda}.\\right)$ Suppose that neither family inherited the property. Then we would have values $\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{r}$ and $\\lambda_{r+1}, \\lambda_{r+2}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{r+s}$ such that the intersection of the $S \\cap U_{\\lambda_{i}}$ and also of the $T \\cap U_{\\lambda_{r+j}}$ would be empty $(i=1,2, \\ldots, r, j=1,2, \\ldots, s)$. In other words, the sets\n\n$$\n\\left(\\bigcap_{i=1}^{r} U_{\\lambda_{i}}\\right) \\cap S \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left(\\bigcap_{j=1}^{s} U_{\\lambda_{r+j}}\\right) \\cap T\n$$\n\nare empty, or equivalently\n\n$$\n\\left(\\bigcap_{i=1}^{r} U_{\\lambda_{i}}\\right) \\subseteq T \\quad \\text { and } \\quad\\left(\\bigcap_{j=1}^{s} U_{\\lambda_{r+j}}\\right) \\subseteq S .\n$$\n\nConsequently\n\n$$\n\\left(\\bigcap_{i=1}^{r+s} U_{\\lambda_{i}}\\right) \\subseteq T \\cap S=\\emptyset\n$$\n\na contradiction. We then get the same type of statement for any decomposition of $H$ into a finite number of pairwise disjoint subsets.\n\nLet us now consider closed subsets $U_{\\lambda}(\\lambda \\in \\Lambda)$ of our topological group $H$ satisfying the finite intersection condition. Repeatedly applying the above procedure, we see that there exists a sequence $\\eta_{1}, \\eta_{2}, \\ldots, \\eta_{k}, \\ldots$ of elements of $H$ for which\n\n$$\n\\eta_{1}+p H \\supseteq \\eta_{2}+p^{2} H \\supseteq \\cdots \\supseteq \\eta_{k}+p^{k} H \\supseteq \\cdots\n$$\n\nand such that for any $k$ the intersection of the $U_{\\lambda}(\\lambda \\in \\Lambda)$ with $\\eta_{k}+p^{k} H$ also satisfies the finite intersection condition; in particular, any $U_{\\lambda}$ and $\\eta_{k}+p^{k} H$ have a common element $\\chi_{k, \\lambda}$. In view of (1) and the completeness of $H$, the sequence $\\eta_{1}, \\eta_{2}, \\ldots, \\eta_{k}, \\ldots$ has a limit $\\eta$ for which $\\eta_{k}+p^{k} H=\\eta+p^{k} H$. For any $\\lambda$ we have $\\chi_{k, \\lambda} \\in$ $\\eta+p^{k} H$; thus the limit of the sequence $\\chi_{1, \\lambda}, \\chi_{2, \\lambda}, \\ldots, \\chi_{k, \\lambda}, \\ldots$ is $\\eta$. Since $U_{\\lambda}$ is closed and $\\chi_{k, \\lambda} \\in U_{\\lambda}$, we get that $\\eta$ is contained in every $U_{\\lambda}$, which completes the proof of the compactness of $H$.\n\nProblem A.3. Let $R=R_{1} \\oplus R_{2}$ be the direct sum of the rings $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$, and let $N_{2}$ be the annihilator ideal of $R_{2}$ (in $R_{2}$ ). Prove that $R_{1}$ will be an ideal in every ring $\\bar{R}$ containing $R$ as an ideal if and only if the only homomorphism from $R_{1}$ to $N_{2}$ is the zero homomorphism.\n\nSolution. First suppose there is a ring $\\bar{R}$ containing $R$ as an ideal and such that $R_{1}$ is not an ideal of $\\bar{R}$. Since $R$ is an ideal in $\\bar{R}$, we have $R_{1} \\bar{r} \\subseteq R$ and $\\bar{r} R_{1} \\subseteq R$ for every $\\bar{r} \\in \\bar{R}$. Suppose for example, that $\\bar{r} R_{1} \\subsetneq R_{1}$ for some $\\bar{r} \\in \\bar{R}$. (The case $R_{1} \\bar{r} \\subsetneq R_{1}$ can be treated similarly.) Using the element $\\bar{r}$ we will define a nonzero homomorphism from $R_{1}$ to $N_{2}$. The direct sum property implies that for every $r_{1} \\in R_{1}$ the element $\\bar{r} r_{1} \\in R$ can be uniquely decomposed in the form $\\bar{r} r_{1}=g\\left(r_{1}\\right)+h\\left(r_{1}\\right)$, where $g\\left(r_{1}\\right) \\in R_{1}$ and $h\\left(r_{1}\\right) \\in R_{2}$. $h$ will be the desired homomorphism. It is clearly defined for all elements of $R_{1}$. Furthermore,\n\n(i) $h\\left(r_{1}\\right) \\in N_{2}$ for every $r_{1} \\in R_{1}$.\n\nNamely, for every $r_{2} \\in R_{2}$ we have\n\n$$\nh\\left(r_{1}\\right) r_{2}=g\\left(r_{1}\\right) r_{2}+h\\left(r_{1}\\right) r_{2}=\\left(g\\left(r_{1}\\right)+h\\left(r_{1}\\right)\\right) r_{2}=\\left(\\bar{r} r_{1}\\right) r_{2}=\\bar{r}\\left(r_{1} r_{2}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nr_{2} h\\left(r_{1}\\right)=r_{2}\\left(\\bar{r} r_{1}\\right)=\\left(r_{2} \\bar{r}\\right) r_{1} \\in R R_{1} \\subseteq R_{1},\n$$\n\nbut on the other hand, $r_{2} h\\left(r_{1}\\right) \\in R_{2}$, proving $r_{2} h\\left(r_{1}\\right)=0$, which gives (i).\n\n(ii) $h\\left(r_{1}+r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=h\\left(r_{1}\\right)+h\\left(r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$ for every $r_{1}, r_{1}^{\\prime} \\in R_{1}$.\n\nSince\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{r}\\left(r_{1}+r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) & =g\\left(r_{1}+r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)+h\\left(r_{1}+r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\bar{r} r_{1}+\\bar{r} r_{1}^{\\prime} \\\\\n& =g\\left(r_{1}\\right)+h\\left(r_{1}\\right)+g\\left(r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)+h\\left(r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=g\\left(r_{1}\\right)+g\\left(r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)+h\\left(r_{1}\\right)+h\\left(r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $g\\left(r_{1}\\right)+g\\left(r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) \\in R_{1}$ and $h\\left(r_{1}\\right)+h\\left(r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) \\in R_{2}$, we get the validity of (ii).\n\n(iii) $h\\left(r_{1} r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=h\\left(r_{1}\\right) h\\left(r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$ for every $r_{1}, r_{1}^{\\prime} \\in R_{1}$.\n\nWe will show that both sides of the equality are equal to zero. For the right-hand side, this is clear because $h\\left(r_{1}\\right)$ is an annihilator of $R_{2}$ and $h\\left(r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) \\in R_{2}$. For the left-hand side, we have to consider the product $\\bar{r}\\left(r_{1} r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$ :\n\n$$\n\\bar{r}\\left(r_{1} r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left(\\bar{r} r_{1}\\right) r_{1}^{\\prime}=\\left(g\\left(r_{1}\\right)+h\\left(r_{1}\\right)\\right) r_{1}^{\\prime}=g\\left(r_{1}\\right) r_{1}^{\\prime} \\in R_{1},\n$$\n\nso $h\\left(r_{1} r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=0$.\n\nThis establishes the first part of the statement.\n\nFor the reverse statement, we use the same idea. We assume that there is a nonzero homomorphism $h$ from $R_{1}$ to $N_{2}$, and we construct the element $\\bar{r}$ in such a way that it should produce $h$. We denote by $R_{0}$ the zero ring over the additive group of the integers. The element of $R_{0}$ corresponding to $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ will be denoted by $\\bar{n}$. The additive group of the ring $\\bar{R}$ is defined by $\\bar{R}^{+}=R_{0}^{+} \\oplus R_{1}^{+} \\oplus R_{2}^{+}$, and for the elements of $\\bar{R}$\n\n$$\nr=\\bar{n}+r_{1}+r_{2}, \\quad r^{\\prime}=\\overline{n^{\\prime}}+r_{1}^{\\prime}+r_{2}^{\\prime},\n$$\n\nwe define the multiplication by\n\n$$\nr r^{\\prime}=r_{1} r_{1}^{\\prime}+r_{2} r_{2}^{\\prime}+n h\\left(r_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)+n^{\\prime} h\\left(r_{1}\\right) .\n$$\n\nIt is routine to check that $\\bar{R}$ is a ring and $R$ is a subring of it. In fact, $R$ is even an ideal of $\\bar{R}$ in view of $\\bar{R} \\bar{R} \\subseteq R$.\n\nTo verify that $R_{1}$ is not an ideal of $\\overline{\\bar{R}}$, take an $r_{1} \\in R_{1}$ with $h\\left(r_{1}\\right) \\neq 0$. Then $\\overline{1} r_{1}=h\\left(r_{1}\\right) \\notin R_{1}$ as $h\\left(r_{1}\\right) \\in R_{2}$, and this shows that $R_{1}$ is not an ideal of $\\bar{R}$.\n\nProblem A.4. Call a polynomial positive reducible if it can be written as a product of two nonconstant polynomials with positive real coefficients. Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial with $f(0) \\neq 0$ such that $f\\left(x^{n}\\right)$ is positive reducible for some natural number $n$. Prove that $f(x)$ itself is positive reducible.\n\nSolution. Consider the product representation of $f\\left(x^{n}\\right)$ :\n\n$$\nf\\left(x^{n}\\right)=\\prod_{j=1}^{s} g_{j}(x)\n$$\n\nwhere the $g_{j}(x)$ are polynomials with positive coefficients. Suppose that some of the polynomials $g_{j}(x)$ contain a term $c_{j k} x^{k}$ with nonvanishing $c_{j k}$ such that $n \\nmid k$. Then the product on the right-hand side of (1) contains the term $c_{j k} \\prod_{i \\neq j} g_{i}(0) x^{k}$. The coefficient of this term does not vanish, since $\\prod_{i=1}^{s} g_{i}(0)=f(0) \\neq 0$. Since the polynomials $g_{j}(x)$ all have positive coefficients, the right-hand side of (1) will contain the term $x^{k}$ with a nonvanishing coefficient, which is a contradiction in view of $n \\nmid k$.\n\nThis means that all the polynomials $g_{j}(x)$ have the form\n\n$$\ng_{j}(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{l_{j}} b_{j l} x^{l n} \\quad\\left(b_{j l} \\geqslant 0, l=0,1, \\ldots, l_{j}\\right),\n$$\n\nthat is, $g_{j}(x)$ is actually a polynomial of $x^{n}: g_{j}(x)=\\bar{g}_{j}\\left(x^{n}\\right)$. So upon substituting $x^{n}=y$, we get\n\n$$\nf(y)=\\prod_{j=1}^{s} \\bar{g}_{j}(y)\n$$\n\nproving the statement of the problem. Problem A.5. Prove that the intersection of all maximal left ideals of a ring is a (two-sided) ideal.\n\nSolution. Let us denote by $B$ the intersection of all maximal left ideals of the ring $R$ (if there are no maximal left ideals, the statement is void). $B$ is clearly a left ideal, so we only have to prove that $b \\in B$ and $r \\in R$ imply $b r \\in B$, or equivalently $b r \\notin B$ implies $b \\notin B$. Since an element is not in $B$ if and only if there is a maximal left ideal not containing it, we actually have to prove the following statement:\n\nIf for some elements $b \\in B, r \\in R$ there is a maximal left ideal $M$ with $b r \\notin M$, then there exists a maximal left ideal $N$ with $b \\notin N$. Let\n\n$$\nN=\\{x \\in R \\mid x r \\in M\\} .\n$$\n\nWe are going to prove that $N$ has the desired properties.\n\n1. $N$ is a left ideal: if $s \\in R$ and $x \\in N$, then $x r \\in M$ implies $s x r \\in M(M$ being a left ideal), which in turn implies $s x \\in N$. Also $x \\in N, y \\in N$ clearly imply $x-y \\in N$.\n\n2. $b \\notin N$ as $b r \\notin M$.\n\n3. $N$ is maximal. To prove this, we have to show that for any element $a$ of $R$ with $a \\notin N$ the only left ideal of $R$ containing both $a$ and $N$ is $R$ itself. We have ar $\\notin M$ since $a \\notin N$. As $M$ was maximal, every element of $R$ is contained in the left ideal generated by $a r$ and $M$; in particular, for every $c \\in R, c r$ can be written in the form\n\n$$\nc r=y a r+n a r+m\n$$\n\nwhere $y \\in R, m \\in M$, and $n$ is an integer. This implies\n\n$$\n(c-y a-n a) r=m \\in M,\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\nd=c-y a-n a \\in N,\n$$\n\nbut this shows that $c=y a+n a+d$ is contained in the left ideal generated by $a$ and $N$, which was to be proved.\n\nRemark. If $R$ has an identity element, then $B$ is of course the Jacobson radical.\n\nProblem A.6. Let $R$ be a finite commutative ring. Prove that $R$ has a multiplicative identity element (1) if and only if the annihilator of $R$ is 0 (that is, $a R=0, a \\in R$ imply $a=0$ ).", "Final Answer": "\\beta p^{r}$, where $\\beta$ is a $p$-adic unit and $r$ an integer. Since the product of $p$-adic units is again a $p$-adic unit, we deduce that a $p$-adic number can be a root of unity only in the case when it is a $p$-adic unit."}
{"Topic": "topology", "Book": "Miklos Schweitzer Competitions", "Problem Statement": "Prove that any uncountable subset of the Euclidean $n$ space contains an uncountable subset with the property that the distances between different pairs of points are different (that is, for any points $P_{1} \\neq$ $P_{2}$ and $Q_{1} \\neq Q_{2}$ of this subset, $\\overline{P_{1} P_{2}}=\\overline{Q_{1} Q_{2}}$ implies either $P_{1}=Q_{1}$ and $P_{2}=Q_{2}$, or $P_{1}=Q_{2}$ and $\\left.P_{2}=Q_{1}\\right)$. Show that a similar statement is not valid if the Euclidean $n$-space is replaced with a (separable) Hilbert space.", "Answer Candidates": [], "Images": [], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "For the proof of the first statement of the problem, we say that a subset of the Euclidean $n$-space $E_{n}$ has property $T$ if the distances between all pairs of points of this subset are different. By induction on $n$, we prove that if all subsets of a set $H\\left(\\subseteq E_{n}\\right)$ that have property $T$ are countable, then $H$ is countable. The case $n=0$ is trivial. Suppose that the statement is true for $n-1(\\geq 0)$. Let $H\\left(\\subseteq E_{n}\\right)$ be a set such that all subsets with property $T$ are countable. By Tukey's lemma, there exists a maximal subset $M$ of $H$ with property $T$. By maximality of $M$, any point of $H \\backslash M$ either has equal distance from two distinct points of $M$ or has a distance from a point of $M$ that equals the distance between some pair of points in $M$. Therefore, $H$ is covered by the perpendicular bisector hyperplanes of pairs of points of $M$, together with the spheres centered at and passing through points of $M$. The set of these hyperplanes $F_{i}$ and spheres $S_{i}$ is countable $(i=1,2, \\ldots)$, since $M$ is countable. Each $H \\cap S_{j}$ is a countable set. Indeed, the preceding argument can be applied to $H \\cap S_{j}$ instead of $H$ (since $H \\cap S_{j}$ satisfies all assumptions made on $H$ ); therefore, the set of $S_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}$ 's and $F_{i}^{\\prime}$ 's that replace the preceding $S_{i}$ 's and $F_{i}$ 's and cover $H \\cap S_{j}$ is countable; by the induction hypothesis $H \\cap F_{i}^{\\prime}$ and (since $S_{j} \\cap S_{i}^{\\prime}$ is contained in a hyperplane of $E_{n}$ ) $H \\cap S_{j} \\cap S_{i}^{\\prime}$ are countable sets. Thus, $H \\cap S_{j}$ is countable since it can be covered by a countable family of countable sets. Further, by the induction hypothesis, each $H \\cap F_{j}$ is a countable set. Therefore, $H$ is a countable set since it is covered by a countable family of countable sets.\n\nIn order to prove the second statement of the problem, it suffices to construct an uncountable subset of the Hilbert space spanned by the orthonormal basis $e_{i}(i=1,2, \\ldots)$, such that the set of distances between all pairs of points in this subset is countable. To this end, consider an uncountable set $\\mathfrak{A}$ of infinite sets of natural numbers with pairwise finite intersection. It is well known that such a set $\\mathfrak{A}$ exists. (For instance, the set of bounded, monotone sequences of rational numbers has this property.) Each set $A(\\in \\mathfrak{A})$ determines a vector $\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1 / 2^{i}\\right) \\cdot e_{\\alpha_{i}}$ in the Hilbert space, where $\\alpha_{i}$ runs through $A$ in increasing order. The set $K$ of these vectors is uncountable. On the other hand, the distance between any pair of elements of $K$ is the square root of a rational number, for if the vectors $a=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1 / 2^{i}\\right) \\cdot e_{\\alpha_{i}}$ and $a^{\\prime}=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1 / 2^{i}\\right) \\cdot e_{\\alpha_{i}}^{\\prime}$ are determined by the sets $A$ and $A^{\\prime}(\\in \\mathfrak{A})$, then \n\n$$\n\\left\\|a-a^{\\prime}\\right\\|^{2}=\\|a\\|^{2}=\\left\\|a^{\\prime}\\right\\|^{2}-2\\left(a, a^{\\prime}\\right)=\\frac{2}{3}-2 \\sum_{a_{i}=a_{j}^{\\prime}} \\frac{1}{2^{i+j}}\n$$\n\nwhere in the last term we have a finite sum since $A \\cap A^{\\prime}$ is finite.\n\nRemark. Istv\u00e1n Juh\u00e1sz and B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s pointed out that a similar argument proves the following generalization of the first statement of the problem: If $\\mathfrak{m}$ is a regular cardinal number, then any subset of cardinality $\\mathfrak{m}$ of the Euclidean $n$-space has a subset of cardinality $\\mathfrak{m}$ in which all distances between pairs of points are different; further, they considered generalizations of the statement to other metric spaces.\n\nProblem T.2. A sentence of the following type is often heard in Hungarian weather reports: \"Last night's minimum temperatures took all values between -3 degrees and +5 degrees.\" Show that it would suffice to say, \"Both -3 degrees and +5 degrees occurred among last night's minimum temperatures.\" (Assume that temperature as a two-variable function of place and time is continuous.)\n\nRemark. The formulation of the problem allows for various models. The proof is simplest when the country is assumed to be compact; not assuming compactness requires a different proof and yields a more general theorem. The argument needs some modification if the time interval is replaced with a (not necessarily metrizable) compact space. In the following solutions, the space is connected and the time is compact. The proof is carried out for metric spaces in the first one and for arbitrary topological spaces in the second one.", "Final Answer": "1,2, \\ldots)$, since $M$ is countable. Each $H \\cap S_{j}$ is a countable set. Indeed, the preceding argument can be applied to $H \\cap S_{j}$ instead of $H$ (since $H \\cap S_{j}$ satisfies all assumptions made on $H$ ); therefore, the set of $S_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}$ 's and $F_{i}^{\\prime}$ 's that replace the preceding $S_{i}$ 's and $F_{i}$ 's and cover $H \\cap S_{j}$ is countable; by the induction hypothesis $H \\cap F_{i}^{\\prime}$ and (since $S_{j} \\cap S_{i}^{\\prime}$ is contained in a hyperplane of $E_{n}$ ) $H \\cap S_{j} \\cap S_{i}^{\\prime}$ are countable sets. Thus, $H \\cap S_{j}$ is countable since it can be covered by a countable family of countable sets. Further, by the induction hypothesis, each $H \\cap F_{j}$ is a countable set. Therefore, $H$ is a countable set since it is covered by a countable family of countable sets."}

Introduce the notation\n\n$$\n\\min _{x \\in[-1,1]} f(x)=p, \\quad \\max _{x \\in[-1,1]} f(x)=q .\n$$\n\nLet $\\phi_{1}(y)$ be the inverse of the restriction to $\\left[-1, c_{1}\\right]$ of the function $f(x)$, and let\n\n$$\n\\phi_{2}(y)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{lll}\nf^{-1}(y) & \\text { if } & p \\leq y \\leq f(1) \\\\\n1 & \\text { if } & f(1) \\leq y \\leq q\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nwhere $f^{-1}(y)$ denotes the inverse of the restriction to $\\left[c_{2}, 1\\right]$ of the function $f(x)$. Obviously, the function $\\phi(y)=\\phi_{2}(y)-\\phi_{1}(y)$ is continuous and strictly increasing on the interval $[p, q]$; further $\\phi(p)=\\phi_{2}(p)-\\phi_{1}(p)=$ $c_{2}-c_{1}$ and $\\phi(q)=\\phi_{2}(q)-\\phi_{1}(q)=2$. We distinguish between two cases.\n\na. If $c_{2}-c_{1} \\leq 1$, then by the above properties of the function $\\phi(y)$ there is one and only one number $k(\\in[p, q])$ with $\\phi(k)=1$. It can be shown that $k$ satisfies (1). Put $\\phi_{1}(k)=d, \\phi_{2}(k)=e, D=(d, k), E=(e, k)$, $G=(-1, k), H=(1, k), A=(-1,1)$, and $B=(1,1)$. The lines $A D$ and $B E$ intersect at a point $F$. By the convexity of $f(x)$ and the relation $|f(x)| \\leq 1$, it is obvious that the graphs of the restrictions of $f(x)$ to the segments $[-1, d],[d, e]$, and $[e, 1]$ lie in the triangles $A G D, D F E$, and $E H B$, respectively. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_{-1}^{1}|f(x)-k| d x & =\\int_{-1}^{d}|f(x)-k| d x+\\int_{d}^{e}|f(x)-k| d x+\\int_{e}^{1}|f(x)-k| d x \\\\\n& \\leq t\\left(A G D_{\\triangle}\\right)+t\\left(D F E_{\\triangle}\\right)+t\\left(E H B_{\\triangle}\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $t$ stands for area. If $F$ lies above the line $y=-1$, then - $D E$ being the mid-parallel of the triangle $A B F$ - the altitudes perpendicular to $G H$ of the triangles in question are equal, so the sum of the areas of the triangles is\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m \\cdot G D+\\frac{1}{2} m \\cdot D E+\\frac{1}{2} m \\cdot E H=\\frac{1}{2} m(G D+D E+E H)=m \\leq 1,(2)\n$$\n\nwhere $m=B H$. If $F$ lies below the line $y=-1$, then (denoting by $J$ the point of intersection of the line $y=-1$ and the segment $A F$, and further denoting by $K$ the point of intersection of the line $y=-1$ and the segment $B F$ ) it is obvious that the graph of the restriction to $[d, e]$ of $f(x)$ remains in the trapezoid $T$ determined by the vertices $D, J, K, E$ and, consequently,\n\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1}|f(x)-k| d x \\leq t\\left(A G D_{\\triangle}\\right)+t(T)+t\\left(E H B_{\\triangle}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhile $m=B H \\geq 1$.

Paul Tur\u00e1n called the attention of the organizing committee to the fact that S. Bernstein (Doklady Akad. Nauk SSSR, 1927, 405-407) had proved the following theorem:\n\nTheorem. Let $f(x)$ be an $n+1$ times differentiable function on the interval $[-1,1]$ satisfying the condition $f^{(n+1)}(x)>0$ on $[-1,1]$. The expression\n\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1}\\left|f(x)-R_{n}(x)\\right| d x\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{n}(x)$ denotes a polynomial of degree $n$, is minimal when $R_{n}(x)$ is the Lagrange interpolation polynomial of degree $n$ that coincides with $f(x)$ at the points $\\cos (h \\pi /(n+2)) \\quad(h=1,2, \\ldots n+1)$.\n\nProblem F.6. Find all linear homogeneous differential equations with continuous coefficients (on the whole real line) such that for any solution $f(t)$ and any real number $c, f(t+c)$ is also a solution.\n\nSolution. As usual in the literature, we restrict attention to differential equations with the coefficient of the term of highest order identical to 1 .\n\nLet the differential equation\n\n$$\ny^{(n)}(x)+f_{1}(x) y^{(n-1)}(x)+\\cdots+f_{n}(x) y(x)=0\n$$\n\nhave the desired properties, and let $\\phi(x)$ be a solution. Let $c$ be an arbitrary real number. Obviously,\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^{i} \\phi(x+c)}{d x^{i}}=\\left(\\frac{d^{i} \\phi(t)}{d t^{i}}\\right)_{t=x+c} \\quad(i=1,2, \\ldots, n)\n$$\n\nsince together with $\\phi(x) \\phi(x+c)$ also satisfies (1), it follows that\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d^{n} \\phi(t)}{d t^{n}}\\right)_{t=x+c}+f_{1}(x)\\left(\\frac{d^{n-1} \\phi(t)}{d t^{n-1}}\\right)_{t=x+c}+\\cdots+f_{n}(x)(\\phi(t))_{t=x+c}=0,\n$$\n\nthat is,\n\n$$\n\\phi^{(n)}(t)+f_{1}(t-c) \\phi^{(n-1)}(t)+\\cdots+f_{n}(t-c) \\phi(t)=0,\n$$\n\nand this is true for any real constant $c$ and all real values of $t$. This means that all solutions of (1), so for example, $n$ linearly independent solutions of (1), satisfy the differential equation\n\n$$\ny^{(n)}(x)+f_{1}(x-c) y^{(n-1)}(x)+\\cdots+f_{n}(x-c) y(x)=0\n$$\n\nhence - as is well known - it follows that the coefficient functions of the differential equations (1) and (3) coincide:\n\n$$\nf_{i}(x)=f_{i}(x-c) \\quad(i=1,2, \\ldots, n) .\n$$\n\nChoosing $x=0$, we obtain $f_{i}(0)=f_{i}(-c)$ for every $c(i=1,2, \\ldots, n)$. Thus $f_{i}(x) \\equiv f_{i}(0)$, and so the differential equation (1) has constant coefficients.\n\nConversely, if (1) has constant coefficients, then from (2) it follows easily that together with any solution $\\phi(x) \\phi(x+c)$ is also a solution.\n\nRemarks.\n\n1. Assuming the conditions for a single $c$ only, from (4) we obtain that the coefficient functions are periodic with period $c$.\n\n2. If, for any solution $\\phi(x), \\phi\\left(x+c_{1}\\right)$ and $\\phi\\left(x+c_{2}\\right)$ are also solutions, then together with $\\phi(x)$ obviously $\\phi\\left(\\left(x+c_{1}\\right)+c_{2}\\right)=\\phi\\left(x+c_{1}+c_{2}\\right)$ is also a solution. Consequently, assuming the conditions for a (finite or infinite) set $\\left\\{c_{\\alpha}\\right\\}$, the condition will also be fulfilled by the elements of the smallest additive semigroup that contains the numbers $c_{\\alpha}$. In view of the previous remark, this implies that it is sufficient to assume the conditions only for values of $c$ that generate an additive semigroup containing a sequence that tends to zero.\n\nProblem F.7. Let $F$ be a closed set in the n-dimensional Euclidean space. Construct a function that is 0 on $F$, positive outside $F$, and whose partial derivatives all exist.\n\nSolution. Define a function $\\phi_{r}(y)$ in the following way:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{r}(y)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{lll}\ne^{\\frac{1}{y-r^{2}}} & \\text { if } & |y|<r^{2} \\\\\n0 & \\text { if } & |y| \\geq r^{2}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nObviously, $\\phi_{r}(y)$ is positive if $|y|<r^{2}$, and infinitely differentiable in the intervals $\\left(-\\infty, r^{2}\\right)$ and $\\left(r^{2},+\\infty\\right)$. Further, it is clear that $\\left(d^{k} \\phi_{r}(y) / d y^{k}\\right)$ has the form $R_{k}(y) \\phi_{r}(y)$, where $R_{k}(y)$ is a rational fractional function; so\n\n$$\n\\lim _{x \\rightarrow r^{2}+0} \\frac{d^{k} \\phi_{r}(y)}{d y^{k}}=\\lim _{x \\rightarrow r^{2}-0} \\frac{d^{k} \\phi_{r}(y)}{d y^{k}}=0 .\n$$\n\nTherefore $\\left(d^{k} \\phi_{r}(y) / d y^{k}\\right)$ is continuous in $\\left(-\\infty, r^{2}\\right)$ and $\\left(r^{2},+\\infty\\right)$ and has right-hand and left-hand limits at the point $y=r^{2}$, whence it follows by induction that $\\phi_{r}(y)$ has continuous derivatives of any order at $y=r^{2}$ and, consequently, at all points $y$.\n\nDenote by $\\mathbb{E}_{n}$ the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. For $a \\in \\mathbb{E}_{n}, x \\in \\mathbb{E}_{n}$, $a=\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right), x=\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ put\n\n$$\ny_{a}(x)=\\left(x_{1}-a_{1}\\right)^{2}+\\left(x_{2}-a_{2}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots+\\left(x_{n}-a_{n}\\right)^{2} .\n$$\n\nObviously, for every $x$, all partial derivatives of $y_{a}(x)$ exist.\n\nFinally, let $G \\subset \\mathbb{E}_{n}$ be an open ball of center $a$ and radius $r$ chosen arbitrarily, and let\n\n$$\nf_{G}(x)=\\phi_{r}\\left(y_{a}(x)\\right)\n$$\n\nSince $\\phi_{r}(y)$ is infinitely differentiable for any $y$ and all partial derivatives of $y_{a}(x)$ exist for any $x$, all partial derivatives of $f_{G}(x)$ exist for any $x$. Moreover, it is evident that if $x \\in G$ then $0 \\leq y_{a}(x)<r^{2}$, so $f_{G}(x)>0$, while if $x \\notin G$ then $f_{G}(x)=0$. Finally, each partial derivative of $f_{G}(x)$ is bounded since it is continuous everywhere and zero outside $G$.\n\nThe complement $\\bar{F}$ of $F$ relative to $\\mathbb{E}_{n}$ is an open set, so it can be represented in the form $\\bar{F}=\\cup_{k=1}^{\\infty} G_{k}$, where $G_{1}, G_{2}, \\ldots$ are open balls.\n\nSince each partial derivative of the functions $f_{G_{1}}(x), f_{G_{2}}(x), \\ldots$ is bounded, there exist positive constants $c_{k}(k=1,2, \\ldots)$ such that all partial derivatives of order not higher than $k$ of the function $f_{G_{k}}(x)$ (including $f_{G_{k}}(x)$ itself) have absolute value less than $\\left(1 / c_{k}\\right)\\left(1 / 2^{k}\\right)$ for every $x$. Then, obviously, the function series\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_{k} f_{G_{k}}(x)\n$$\n\nis absolutely convergent; we set\n\n$$\nF(x)=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_{k} f_{G_{k}}(x)\n$$\n\nForming a partial derivative of order $i$ of the terms of the series, the definition of $c_{k}$ ensures that, beginning with the $i$ th term, the absolute value of each term can be majorized by $1 / 2^{k}$, so the sum of the partial derivatives is absolutely convergent. It follows that all partial derivatives of $F(x)$ exist. Finally, it is clear that $F(x)=0$ for $x \\in F$ and $F(x)>0$ for $x \\notin F$, thus the function $F(x)$ has the required properties.\n\nRemark. Let $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ be disjoint closed sets in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. By a similar method, one can construct an infinitely differentiable function that is equal to 0 on $F_{1}$, equal to 1 on $F_{2}$, and positive and less than 1 outside $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$.\n\nProblem F.8. Let $f$ be a continuous, nonconstant, real function, and assume the existence of an $F$ such that $f(x+y)=F[f(x), f(y)]$ for all real $x$ and $y$. Prove that $f$ is strictly monotone.\n\nSolution. Suppose that $f$ is not strictly monotone. Then by the continuity of $f$ there exist real numbers $s_{1}<s_{2}$ with $f\\left(s_{1}\\right)=f\\left(s_{2}\\right)$. If $\\varepsilon>0$ is arbitrary, then by the continuity of $f$ there are values $t_{1}<t_{2}$ in the closed interval $\\left[s_{1}, s_{2}\\right]$ such that $t_{2}-t_{1}<\\varepsilon$ and $f\\left(t_{1}\\right)=f\\left(t_{2}\\right)$. Then, however,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf\\left[t+\\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\\right)\\right] & =f\\left[\\left(t-t_{1}\\right)+t_{2}\\right]=F\\left[f\\left(t-t_{1}\\right), f\\left(t_{2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n& =F\\left[f\\left(t-t_{1}\\right), f\\left(t_{1}\\right)\\right]=f\\left[\\left(t-t_{1}\\right)+t_{1}\\right]=f(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfor all real values $t$. Thus $\\tau=t_{2}-t_{1}$ is a period of $f$. Since $\\tau<\\varepsilon$ where $\\varepsilon>0$ is arbitrary, it follows that the continuous function $f$ has arbitrarily small periods. Hence $f$ is constant, contrary to the assumption.", "Final Answer": "By a theorem of Fej\u00e9r, there exists a power series"}

For $k=2,3, \\ldots$, let $s(2, k+$ $2, k+2)=2+3+\\cdots+k+(k+1)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}k+2 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)-1=L_{k}$. By claims $1-4, A_{n}$ has at least two elements if $n \\geq 5$, and if $k \\geq 2$ then the possible extremal sets are as follows: $A(2, k+2, k+2), A(2, k+2, k+1), \\ldots, A(2, k+2,3), A(2, k+$ $2,2), A(3, k+3, k+1)$. Obviously, $s(2, k+2, k+2)=L_{k}, s(2, k+2, k+$ 1) $=L_{k}+1, \\ldots, s(2, k+2,3)=L_{k}+(k-1), s(2, k+2,2)=L_{k}+k$ and $s(3, k+3, k+1)=L_{k}+(k+1)=L_{k+1}-1$, so the sums of the elements of the above sets are the integers in the interval $\\left[L_{k}, L_{k+1}\\right)$, and each integer appears exactly once.

Consider the following generalization of the problem: Let $f(x)$ be an arbitrary function that is strictly concave from below in the interval $(0,+\\infty)\\left(f(x)=\\log x\\right.$ in the problem above). Let $n=\\sum_{i=1}^{k} a_{i}$, where $a_{1}<a_{2}<\\cdots<a_{k}$ are positive integers, $k$ is not fixed. When will the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} f\\left(a_{k}\\right)$ be maximum for a given $n$ ? It can be proved that also in this case every extremal set can be obtained from a sequence of consecutive natural numbers deleting at most one element.\n\nProblem C.2. For every natural number $r$, the set of $r$-tuples of natural numbers is partitioned into finitely many classes. Show that if $f(r)$ is a function such that $f(r) \\geq 1$ and $\\lim _{r \\rightarrow \\infty} f(r)=+\\infty$, then there exists an infinite set of natural numbers that, for all $r$, contains $r$-tuples from at most $f(r)$ classes. Show that if $f(r) \\nrightarrow+\\infty$, then there is a family of partitions such that no such infinite set exists.\n\nSolution. Let $\\mathbb{N}$ denote the set of natural numbers. We will use the following well-known theorem of Ramsey. If the $r$-tuples of natural numbers are divided into finitely many classes, then there is an infinite subset $\\mathbb{N}^{\\prime}$ of $\\mathbb{N}$ such that every $r$-tuple in $\\mathbb{N}^{\\prime}$ is contained in the very same class.\n\nTo prove the first statement, we define a sequence $\\mathbb{N}_{0} \\supseteq \\cdots \\supseteq \\mathbb{N}_{r} \\supseteq \\ldots$ of subsets and a sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{r}, \\ldots$ of natural numbers by induction on $r$. Let $\\mathbb{N}_{0}=\\mathbb{N}$. Suppose that $r \\geq 0$ and that $\\mathbb{N}_{r}$ and $x_{i} \\quad(i<r)$ are defined, $\\mathbb{N}_{r}$ is infinite. Let $x_{r}$ be an arbitrary element of $\\mathbb{N}_{r}$ and let $\\mathbb{N}_{r}^{\\prime}=\\mathbb{N}_{r}-\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{r}\\right\\}$. For any set $A^{\\prime} \\subseteq\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{r}\\right\\}$, divide the $(r-s)$ tuples of $\\mathbb{N}_{r}^{\\prime}$ into finitely many classes where $s=\\left|A^{\\prime}\\right|$. Put two $(r-s)$-tuples into the same class if and only if adding the elements of $A^{\\prime}$ to them the resulting $r$-tuples are in the same class of the original partition. Applying Ramsey's theorem $2^{r}$ times, we get that there is a subset $\\mathbb{N}_{r+1}$ of the set $\\mathbb{N}_{r}^{\\prime}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n|A|=|B|=r, \\\\\nA, B \\subseteq\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{r}\\right\\} \\cup \\mathbb{N}_{r+1}, \\quad A \\cap\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{r}\\right\\}=B \\cap\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{r}\\right\\}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nimply that $A$ and $B$ are in the very same class. So, we defined the sequences $\\mathbb{N}_{0} \\supseteq \\cdots \\supseteq \\mathbb{N}_{r} \\supseteq \\ldots ; x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{r}, \\ldots$ Let $X=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{r}, \\ldots\\right\\}$. Now, (1) and (2) imply that $X$ has the following properties.\n\n(*) Suppose that $|A|=|B|=r, \\quad A, B \\subseteq X, \\quad A \\cap\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{r}\\right\\}=B \\cap$ $\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{r}\\right\\}$ for any $r$. Then $A$ and $B$ are in the very same class. Since $f(r) \\geq 1$ and $f(r) \\rightarrow+\\infty$ as $r \\rightarrow+\\infty$, thus there exists a monotone subsequence $x_{r_{k}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\left\\{x_{r_{k}}: r_{k} \\leq r\\right\\}\\right| \\leq \\log _{2} f(r) .\n$$\n\nLet $X^{\\prime}=\\left\\{x_{r_{1}}, x_{r_{2}}, \\ldots\\right\\}$. This set $X^{\\prime}$ is obviously infinite and meets the requirements of the problem by $(*)$.\n\nNow, we are to prove a statement that is stronger than the second part of the problem. We show that a set of cardinality continuum has the desired partition, as well. Let $S=[0,1]$. We divide the set of $r$-element subsets of $S$ into $r$ classes for any $r$. Let $X=\\left\\{x_{0}, \\ldots, x_{r-1}\\right\\}$ be an $r$ element subset of $S$ with $x_{0}<\\cdots<x_{r-1}$. We put $X$ into the $i$ th class if exactly $i$ of the intervals $\\left(x_{j}, x_{j+1}\\right) \\quad(j=0,1, \\ldots, r-2)$ are longer than $1 / r$. If $S^{\\prime}$ is an arbitrary infinite subset of $S$, then using the fact that $S^{\\prime}$ has an accumulation point, it is easy to see that for any $i$ there is a number $r_{0}$ such that for $r>r_{0}$ the set $S^{\\prime}$ contains a set out of the $i$ th class of the $r$-tuples, and so our proof is complete.\n\nProblem C.3.

Since the translation that moves one of two congruent and parallel circles on the sphere to the other is perpendicular to the plane of the circles, the generators of the prism are perpendicular to the base, thus, the prism in question is a right prism.\n\nSides of a right prism are rectangles. Since they are also circumscribed, and only squares are circumscribed among rectangles, each side of the prism is a square. Consequently, the edges of the bases and the generators have the same length, the bases are regular, and the sum of the lengths of the edges of the prism is three times the perimeter of the base.\n\nLet us cut the prism and the sphere by a plane through the center of the sphere, parallel to the base. The prism is cut in a polygon congruent to the base polygons; the sphere is cut in a great circle. The great circle contains the point of contact of every tangents of the sphere orthogonal to the plane of the great circle. Therefore, it contains a point from each generator. We get that the base polygon is inscribed in a unit circle. Since the base polygon has equal sides, it must be a regular polygon. We conclude that the prisms that satisfy the prescribed condition are regular prisms, with the length of the generators equal to the length of the sides of the base polygon scaled in such a way that the circumcircle of the base polygon has radius 1.\n\nConversely, every prism of this type satisfies the condition of the problem, since the center of such a prism is located at distance 1 from each edge. Indeed, the distance to the center from a generator is clearly equal to 1 . On the other hand, the orthogonal projection of the center onto a lateral face, which is a square, is the center of the face. Thus the distances to the center from the sides of this square are equal.\n\nTo get the sum of the lengths of the edges of such a prism, we have to multiply by 3 the perimeter of a regular polygon inscribed in a unit circle. It remains to decide which of these regular polygons has the shortest perimeter.\n\nThe perimeter of a regular $n$-gon inscribed in a unit circle is equal to\n\n$$\n2 n \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{n}=2 \\pi \\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{\\alpha},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha=\\pi / n$. Since $\\sin x$ is concave on the interval $(0, \\pi)$, the slope of the chord connecting the origin to the point $(x, \\sin x)$ is decreasing as $x$ is increasing. Therefore, $\\sin \\alpha / \\alpha$ is minimal when $\\alpha=\\pi / n$ is maximal, that is, $n$ is minimal. Thus, the minimum is attained by a regular triangle.\n\nAs for the prisms, the minimum of the sum of the edge lengths is obtained for a regular prism over a triangular base, with lateral faces being squares, and the value of the minimum is $3 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\sin 60^{\\circ}=9 \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nProblem G.2. Show that the perimeter of an arbitrary planar section of a tetrahedron is less than the perimeter of one of the faces of the tetrahedron.\n\nSolution. Obviously, planar sections of a tetrahedron are triangles or quadrangles, since each face of the tetrahedron contains at most one edge of the intersection provided that the intersection does not coincide with the face.\n\nThe case of quadrangles can be reduced to the case of triangles. Namely, we show that if we translate the plane of a quadrangle intersection in both directions until it passes through the nearest vertex, then one of the translated planes intersects the tetrahedron in a triangle (possibly degenerated to an edge), the perimeter of which is not shorter than the perimeter of the quadrangle.\n\nIf both translated planes intersect the tetrahedron in a triangle, then introduce the notation shown in Figure G.1 and express the sides of the quadrangle with the help of the sides of the two triangles. Since the planes of the three sections are parallel, the ratio of the segments of a straight line cut off by these planes is the same for all straight lines. Set\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\overline{B P}: \\overline{A B}=\\overline{B Q}: \\overline{B T}=\\overline{F R}: \\overline{U F}=\\overline{G S}: \\overline{A G} .\n$$\n\nThen for the corresponding sides we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& p=\\lambda a_{1}, \\quad q=b_{1}+(1-\\lambda)\\left(b_{2}-b_{1}\\right)=\\lambda b_{1}+(1-\\lambda) b_{2}, \\\\\n& r=c_{2}+\\lambda\\left(c_{1}-c_{2}\\right)=\\lambda c_{1}+(1-\\lambda) c_{2}, \\quad s=(1-\\lambda) a_{2} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom these, $p+q+r+s=\\lambda\\left(a_{1}+b_{1}+c_{1}\\right)+(1-\\lambda)\\left(a_{2}+b_{2}+c_{2}\\right)$, that is, $K=\\lambda K_{1}+(1-\\lambda) K_{2}$, where $K=p+q+r+s, K_{1}=a_{1}+b_{1}+c_{1}$, and $K_{2}=a_{2}+b_{2}+c_{2}$. This implies\n\n$$\nK \\leq \\max \\left\\{K_{1}, K_{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIf one of the triangles $\\triangle A U T$, or $\\triangle B G F$, or both degeneratse to the edges $\\overline{A D}$ or $\\overline{B C}$, respectively, then this inequality remains valid, putting $K_{1}=$ $2 \\overline{A D}$ or $K_{2}=2 \\overline{B C}$, respectively. Then we get that the perimeter of one of \n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_03_31_a772810374395e83138ag-03.jpg?height=702&width=762&top_left_y=337&top_left_x=736)\n\nFigure G.1.\n\nthe faces of the tetrahedron is greater than the perimeter of the intersection quadrangle.\n\nHence, it is enough to consider the case of triangle intersections. We may suppose that the intersection triangle has a vertex in common with the tetrahedron. Otherwise we may translate the plane of the triangle to reach this situation (see Figure G.2). The translated plane meets the tetrahedron in a triangle similar to the original one, with ratio of similarity greater than 1 and it passes through that vertex of the nonintersected face of the tetrahedron that is nearest to the intersecting plane.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_03_31_a772810374395e83138ag-03.jpg?height=699&width=764&top_left_y=1727&top_left_x=732)\n\nFigure G.2.\n\nIf the intersecting plane is parallel to the face not met by it, the assertion is trivial. Otherwise, we show that the perimeter of $\\triangle K B M$ is smaller than the greater of the perimeters of $\\triangle K B C$ and $\\triangle K B D$. For this purpose, consider the smallest ellipsoid of revolution with foci $K$ and $B$ that contains both $C$ and $D$. Since $M$ is an internal point of it, we get\n\n$$\n\\overline{K M}+\\overline{M B}<\\max \\{\\overline{K C}+\\overline{C B}, \\overline{K D}+\\overline{D B}\\} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nBut then, either $k_{K B M}<k_{K B D}<k_{A B D}$ or $k_{K B M}<k_{K B C}$, where $k_{P Q R}$ denotes the perimeter of $\\triangle P Q R$. In the first case, the assertion is proved, the second case can be finished by a repeated application of the previous arguments.\n\nProblem G.3. Show that the center of gravity of a convex region in the plane halves at least three chords of the region.\n\nSolution. Let us denote the disc by $T$ and its barycenter by $S$. If $X$ is a point of the boundary curve $G$ of $T$, then denote by $Y(X)$ the second intersection point of the straight line $X S$ and the curve $G$. Let $f(X)=$ $\\overline{X S}-\\overline{Y(X) S}$. We have $f(X)=-f(Y(X))$ for any $X \\in G$. Since $f(X)$ changes continuously as $X$ runs over the $\\operatorname{arc} \\overparen{X Y}(X)$, it attains any value between $f(X)$ and $-f(X)$. This implies the existence of a point $X_{1} \\in$ $G$ such that $\\overline{X_{1} S}=\\overline{Y\\left(X_{1}\\right) S}$. If $X_{1} S$ were the only straight line whose intersection with $T$ is halved by $S$, then $f$ would be positive along one of the $\\operatorname{arcs} \\widehat{X_{1} Y}\\left(X_{1}\\right)$. Reflecting this arc through $S$, the reflected arc together with the other $\\operatorname{arc} \\widehat{X_{1} Y}\\left(X_{1}\\right)$ of $G$ would bound a domain $T_{1}$, the barycenter of which is different from $S$, since $T_{1}$ lies in a half-plane bounded by a straight line passing through $S$. Therefore, the barycenter of the union $T_{2}=T_{1} \\cup T$ should be different from $S$. On the other hand, $T_{2}$ is centrally symmetric with respect to $S$, so its barycenter should be invariant under the reflection in $S$, which means that its barycenter should be $S$, which is a contradiction.\n\nThe same arguments show that if $f$ has finite zeros, then it can not be nonnegative on a half-arc of $G$. Suppose that there are only two straight lines $X_{1} S$ and $X_{2} S$ for which the segment of the straight line cut off by the figure is halved by $S\\left(X_{1}, X_{2} \\in G\\right)$. By the previous remark, $f$ must be negative (or positive) on the $\\operatorname{arcs} X_{2} Y\\left(X_{1}\\right)$ and $\\overparen{X_{1} Y}\\left(X_{2}\\right)$, which is a contradiction, since the sign of $f$ is opposite on arcs opposite to one another. We conclude that at least three chords of the figure are halved by $S$. The existence of four such chords cannot be proved in general, as it is shown by the case of an arbitrary triangle.\n\nProblem G.4. Let $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ be the vertices of a closed convex $n$-gon $K$ numbered consecutively. Show that at least $n-3$ vertices $A_{i}$ have the property that the reflection of $A_{i}$ with respect to the midpoint of $\\overline{A_{i-1} A_{i+1}}$ is contained in $K$. (Indices are meant $\\bmod n$.)\n\nSolution. We shall call a vertex $P$ of $K$ reflectible with respect to $K$ if its reflection in the midpoint of the segment connecting the two neighbors of $P$ belongs to $K$. 1. Let us begin with the first nontrivial case, with the case of quadrangles. For both pairs of opposite sides, the sum of angles lying on one of the two sides is at least $\\pi$; let us denote by $A$ a common vertex of two such sides and denote the other vertices in a cyclic order by $B, C, D$ (see Figure G.3). We show that $A$ is reflectible with respect to the quadrangle. We can construct the reflection $A^{\\prime}$ of $A$ by taking a parallel to $A B$ through $D$, which intersects side $B C$ in a point $E$ because $\\varangle A D C+\\varangle B A D \\geq \\pi$, and then taking the parallel to $A D$ through $B$, which intersects the segment $D E$ at $A^{\\prime}$ because $\\varangle D A B+\\varangle A B C \\geq \\pi$. Therefore, $A^{\\prime}$ belongs to the quadrangle $A B C D$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_03_31_a772810374395e83138ag-05.jpg?height=493&width=569&top_left_y=954&top_left_x=450)\n\nFigure G.3.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_03_31_a772810374395e83138ag-05.jpg?height=491&width=547&top_left_y=958&top_left_x=1190)\n\nFigure G.4.\n\n2. If we show that among any four vertices of the convex polygon $K$, at least one is reflectible with respect to $K$, then the assertion of the problem is proved.\n\nWe shall say that a vertex $P$ of the polygon precedes the neighboring vertex $R$ if going around $K$ starting from $P$ in the direction of $R$ is a movement of positive orientation. Consider four arbitrary vertices of $K$ and apply for them the previous notation, that is, let $\\varangle A D C+\\varangle B A D \\geq \\pi$, $\\varangle D A B+\\varangle A B C \\geq \\pi$ (see Figure G.4). If the vertex $E$ of $K$ that follows $A$ is not $B$, then $E$ is an internal point of the intersection $S$ of three halfplanes $S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3}$, where $S_{1}$ is bounded by the straight line $A D$ and contains $A B C D, S_{2}$ is bounded by $B C$ and contains $A B C D$, and $S_{3}$ is bounded by $A B$ and does not contain $A B C D$. Similarly, if the vertex $F$ that precedes $A$ is not $D$, then $F$ is an internal point of the domain $T=T_{1} \\cap T_{2} \\cap T_{3}$, where the half-plane $T_{1}$ is bounded by the straight line $A B$ and contains $A B C D, T_{2}$ is bounded by $D C$ and contains $A B C D$, and $T_{3}$ is bounded by $A D$ and does not contain $A B C D$. It is enough to prove that $A$ is reflectible with respect to the quadrangle $A E C F$, since then it is obviously reflectible with respect to $K$ as well. For this purpose, it suffices to show that $\\varangle E A F+\\varangle A F C \\geq \\pi$ and $\\varangle F A E+\\varangle E A C \\geq \\pi$. It is enough to see the first inequality; the second can be shown in a similar way. But we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\varangle E A F+\\varangle A F C & =\\varangle E A C+(\\varangle C A F+\\varangle A F C) \\\\\n& =\\varangle E A C+\\pi-\\varangle A C F \\geq \\varangle B A C+\\pi-\\varangle A C D \\\\\n& =\\varangle B A C+(\\varangle C A D+\\varangle A D C)=\\varangle B A D+\\varangle A D C \\geq \\pi,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich proves the assertion of the problem.\n\nRemarks.\n\n1. The assertion cannot be improved; that is, there exists for all $n$ a convex $n$-gon having exactly $n-3$ reflectible vertices. Indeed, consider a convex quadrangle $A B C D$ with no parallel sides. It is easy to see that such a quadrangle has only one reflectible vertex; denote it by $A$. Now consider a convex $n$-gon $K$ such that $B, C$, and $D$ are vertices of $K$ while the other vertices of $K$ lie in a neighborhood of radius $\\varepsilon$ of $A$ (obviously, such a convex $n$-gon exists for any $n$ ). It can be easily seen that if $\\varepsilon$ is sufficiently small, then $B, C$, and $D$ are not reflectible with respect to $K$.\n\n2. The assertion does not hold for concave polygons.\n\nProblem G.5. Is it true that on any surface homeomorphic to an open disc there exist two congruent curves homeomorphic to a circle?\n\nSolution. The answer is no: There exists a surface homeomorphic to a disc which does not contain two congruent curves homeomorphic to a circle. We show this by giving an example.\n\nWe start from a minimal surface, that is, from a surface for which $H=1 / 2\\left(g_{1}+g_{2}\\right)=0$. (Here $H$ denotes the Minkowski curvature, and $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ are the principal curvatures of the surface.) Although unnecessary, we explain why we are looking for counterexamples among minimal surfaces. If two congruent copies of a surface intersect one another in a closed curve, then by covering one copy with the other, the two positions of the intersection curve give two congruent curves on the surface, which are different in general. If two copies are tangent to one another at an isolated common point, then by a slight movement of one of them, they can be made to intersect one another along a curve. The choice of minimal surfaces is justified by the fact that if $H>0$ at a point of a surface, then we can always find a congruent surface so that this point is an isolated common point of them. We can get such a surface by reflecting the original surface in the tangent plane at the point in question and then rotating it $90^{\\circ}$ about the normal of the surface. This follows from Euler's theorem, since by the inequality\n\n$$\ng_{1} \\cos ^{2} \\varphi+g_{2} \\sin ^{2} \\varphi>-g_{2} \\cos ^{2} \\varphi-g_{1} \\sin ^{2} \\varphi,\n$$\n\nthe curvatures of the normal sections of the original surface are always greater than the curvatures of the corresponding normal sections of the transformed surface, and therefore the first surface is above the second one in a small neighborhood (looking at them from the direction of the normal vector).\n\nNow we show that in a sufficiently small domain of a minimal surface, any two congruent closed curves bound congruent domains of the surface. For this purpose, take two copies of the surface and move one of them so that the congruent curves cover one another. Suppose that the piece of the minimal surface is small enough to ensure that both surfaces can be obtained as the graph of the single-valued functions $z=f_{1}(x, y)$ and $z=f_{2}(x, y)$. The areas of the domains bounded by the closed curve are obtained as integrals of the lengths of the vectors $m_{1}\\left(-1, p_{1}, q_{1}\\right)$ and $m_{2}\\left(-1, p_{2}, q_{2}\\right)$, respectively, over the same domain. (Here $p_{i}$ and $q_{i}$ denote the partial derivatives of $f_{i}$.)\n\nWe use the fact that the variation of the surface area of a minimal surface is 0 , that is, if a minimal surface is embedded into a one-parameter family of surfaces all having the same boundary, then the derivative of the area of these surfaces with respect to the parameter is zero at the minimal surface. Consider the one-parameter family of surfaces defined by $z=\\lambda f_{1}+(1-\\lambda) f_{2}$. The area of a member of this family is obtained as the integral of the magnitude of the vector $\\lambda m_{1}+(1-\\lambda) m_{2}$. This magnitude is a strictly convex function of the parameter $\\lambda$ if $m_{1} \\neq m_{2}$ and does not depend on $\\lambda$ if $m_{1}=m_{2}$. Consequently, the area, obtained by integrating convex functions of $\\lambda$, is itself a convex function of $\\lambda$. Its derivatives at $\\lambda=0$ and 1 can vanish only if it is a constant function, and this happens only if $m_{1}=m_{2}$ at any point of the domain, that is, if the two pieces of surfaces coincide.\n\nAccording to this observation, it is enough to find a minimal surface that does not contain different congruent pieces. Since two irreducible algebraic surfaces that have a domain in common coincide, it is enough to present an algebraic minimal surface that has no or only a finite number of automorphisms different from the identity. (An automorphism of a surface is a bijective mapping of the surface onto itself that can be extended to a congruence of the space.) If the surface has finite automorphisms, then a small neighborhood of a point different from its automorphic images has no automorphisms different from the identity.\n\nActually, any algebraic minimal surface would do, provided it is not a surface of revolution. However, we need to find only one of them. A simple computation shows that for the surface\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x=u^{3}-3 u v^{2}+3 u, \\\\\n& y=v^{3}-3 u^{2} v+3 v, \\\\\n& z=6 u v,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$H=0$ and $K=-\\frac{9}{4}\\left(u^{2}+v^{2}+1\\right)^{2}(K$ is the Gauss curvature). The latter attains its minimum only at $u=v=0$; thus this point and the Dupin indicatrix at this point must be fixed by any automorphism of the surface. There may be only a finite number of such automorphisms, however, since the Dupin indicatrix is a hyperbola by $K<0$.\n\nProblem G.6. The plane is divided into domains by $n$ straight lines in general position, where $n \\geq 3$. Determine the maximum and minimum possible number of angular domains among them. (We say that $n$ lines are in general position if no two are parallel and no three are concurrent.)\n\nSolution. The minimal number of angular domains is three. Indeed, the convex hull of the intersection points of the straight lines is a convex polygon having at least three vertices. Each vertex is an intersection point of two straight lines and those half-lines of these lines, which go outside the convex hull, bound an angular domain of the considered subdivision, since there are no intersection points on them.\n\nOn the other hand, one can always position $n \\geq 3$ straight lines in the plane so that the number of angular domains is exactly 3 . Such a construction is given by $n$ tangents to a quadrant (see Figure G.5).\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_03_31_a772810374395e83138ag-08.jpg?height=504&width=575&top_left_y=1293&top_left_x=729)\n\nFigure G.5.\n\nThe maximal number of angular domains is\n\n$$\nn+\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}-1}{2}\n$$\n\nthat is, $n$ if $n$ is odd and $n-1$ if $n$ is even. Indeed, each straight line is divided by the others into two half-lines and some segments. Angular domains can be bounded only by these half-lines, and each half-line bounds at most one angular domain (otherwise there would be a point that lies on three of the straight lines). It follows that $2 n$ half-lines can bound no more than $n$ angular domains.\n\nFor odd $n$, we can present an (essentially unique) construction with $n$ straight lines and $n$ angular domains: Consider the longest diagonals of a regular $n$-gon. These $n$ straight lines are in general position. There is an \n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_03_31_a772810374395e83138ag-09.jpg?height=735&width=704&top_left_y=332&top_left_x=754)\n\nFigure G.6.\n\nangular domain at each vertex of the polygon. Thus the number of angular domains is $n$ (see Figure G.6).\n\nWe prove that if $n$ straight lines in general position bound $n$ angular domains, then $n$ is odd. Removing the two half-lines considered above from each straight line gives $n$ segments. Any endpoint of such a segment is shared by exactly two segments. If two of the segments have different endpoints, then they cross one another since the intersection point of their straight lines can lie neither outside nor at the end of the segments. Thus, the union of the segments yields a (number of) self-intersecting closed broken line(s). Fix an orientation on each of these broken lines, and consider three consecutive segments $a, b$, and $c$ on one of them. Since $a$ and $c$ intersect, they lie on the same side of $b$. Omitting the endpoints of $a$ and $b$ (that is, three points), we can couple the remaining vertices, saying that the points $P, Q$ form a pair if $P$ is on the same side of $b$ as the segments $a$ and $c$, and $Q$ is the neighboring vertex that comes after $P$ according to the fixed orientation on the broken line containing $P$. Hence, the number, $n$, of vertices is odd.\n\nIn the case of even $n$, we can attain the maximal $(n-1)$ angular domains. This follows directly from Figure G.6; if we remove one straight line, the number of angular domains decreases by 2 .\n\nProblem G.7. Let $A=A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4}$ be a tetrahedron, and suppose that for each $j \\neq k,\\left[A_{j}, A_{j k}\\right]$ is a segment of length $\\rho$ extending from $A_{j}$ in the direction of $A_{k}$. Let $p_{j}$ be the intersection line of the planes $\\left[A_{j k} A_{j l} A_{j m}\\right]$ and $\\left[A_{k} A_{l} A_{m}\\right]$. Show that there are infinitely many straight lines that intersect the straight lines $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}$ simultaneously.\n\nSolution. It is natural to assume that we are in the projective space obtained from the Euclidean space by joining ideal elements. Exclude first the singular cases, and assume the tetrahedron has no edges of length $\\rho$. Let $\\{j, k, l, m\\}=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. Denote the intersection point of the straight lines $A_{k} A_{l}$ and $A_{j k} A_{j l}$ by $B_{j m}$. Obviously, $B_{j m}$ is the intersection point of the plane $S_{m}=\\left[A_{j} A_{k} A_{l}\\right]$ opposite to $A_{m}$ and the straight line $p_{j}$. Consider now the plane $S_{j}$ (see Figure G.7). The points $B_{k j}, B_{l j}, B_{m j}$ are adjacent to a straight line $e_{j}$, as is easy to see by a multiple application of Menelaos' theorem. This implies that $e_{j}$ intersects $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}$ simultaneously. (Indeed, the points $B_{k j}, B_{l j}, B_{m j}$ belong to $p_{k}, p_{l}, p_{m}$, respectively, while $p_{j}$ and $e_{j}$ are coplanar.) The line $e_{j}$ is not an edge of the tetrahedron, since it would result, the excluded case. The lines $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, e_{4}$ are all different since they lie in different planes of the tetrahedron, but none of them coincides with an edge.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_03_31_a772810374395e83138ag-10.jpg?height=542&width=976&top_left_y=1076&top_left_x=539)\n\nFigure G.7.\n\nTherefore, the lines $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}$ are intersected by four different straight lines simultaneously. If two of the lines $p_{i}(i=1,2,3,4)$ are intersecting, then their point in common must be contained in the plane spanned by the two other straight lines; hence we can easily find infinitely many straight lines intersecting all four of them.\n\nIf $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}$ are mutually skew, then take $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}$. It is known that the straight lines that intersect all of these three lines sweep out a doubly ruled second-order surface. One family of straight lines on this surface is given by the straight lines intersecting $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}$, while $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}$ belong to the other family. The line $p_{4}$ has more than two points in common with the surface, hence it is also a generator of it and intersects every straight line in the first family.\n\nNow let us discuss the singular cases.\n\n(a) If the three edges starting from one of the vertices $A_{k}$ have length $\\rho$, then $p_{k}$ is not properly defined, while the three other lines are adjacent to $A_{k}$. As $p_{k}$ is not determined, the statement cannot be applied to this case. If, however, we define $p_{k}$ as an arbitrary straight line in the two coinciding planes that should define it, the statement is clearly true.\n\n(b) If there are two edges of length $\\rho$ starting from a vertex $A_{k}$, then denote by $A_{l}$ the fourth vertex, not lying on these edges. It is easy to see that in this case $p_{k}$ is the intersection of the planes $S_{k}$ and $S_{l}$, $p_{l} \\subset S_{l}$, while the two other lines, $p_{j}, p_{m}$, go through $A_{k}$. This means that any straight line $e$ such that $A_{k} \\in e \\subset S_{l}$ intersects all the lines $p_{i}$.\n\n(c) Assume now that the tetrahedron has exactly one edge of length $\\rho$. In this case, one of the straight lines $e_{i}$ coincides with this edge, and therefore we can only say that there are three different straight lines among $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, e_{4}$. However, to apply the arguments used in the generic case, it suffices to have three straight lines that intersect all of $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}$. Thus, $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}$ are intersected by infinitely many straight lines simultaneously.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_03_31_a772810374395e83138ag-11.jpg?height=656&width=914&top_left_y=1174&top_left_x=646)\n\nFigure G.8.\n\n(d) Assume, finally, that the tetrahedron has two edges of length $\\rho$, opposite to one another, say $A_{1} A_{3}=A_{2} A_{4}=\\rho=a$. Introduce the notation $A_{1} A_{2}=b, A_{2} A_{3}=c, A_{3} A_{4}=d, A_{1} A_{4}=f$ (see Figure G.8).

{"Topic": "set_theory", "Book": "Miklos Schweitzer Competitions", "Problem Statement": "Does there exist a function $f(x, y)$ of two real variables that takes natural numbers as its values and for which $f(x, y)=f(y, z)$ implies $x=y=z$ ?\n\nSolution 1. First, we show that it is sufficient to construct for each real number $c$, two sets $A_{c}$ and $B_{c}$ of natural numbers that satisfy the following conditions:\n\n(1) $1 \\notin A_{c}, 1 \\notin B_{c}$ for all $c$,\n\n(2) $A_{c} \\cap B_{c}=\\emptyset$ for all $c$\n\n(3) $A_{c} \\cap B_{d} \\neq \\emptyset$ for $c \\neq d$.\n\nIndeed, put $f(c, c)=1$, and for $c \\neq d$, let $f(c, d)$ be an arbitrary element of the nonempty set $A_{c} \\cap B_{d}$. Now, if\n\n$$\nf(x, y)=f(y, z)=m \\neq 1\n$$\n\nthen\n\n$$\nm \\in A_{x} \\cap B_{y} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad m \\in A_{y} \\cap B_{z}\n$$\n\nthat is,\n\n$$\nm \\in A_{x} \\cap B_{y} \\cap A_{y} \\cap B_{z} \\subset A_{y} \\cap B_{y}=\\emptyset\n$$\n\nwhich is a contradiction. But $m=1$ is only possible when $x=y=z$.\n\nIn order to construct $A_{c}$ and $B_{c}$, map the set $\\mathbb{R}$ of rational numbers bijectively onto the set $N=\\{2,3, \\ldots\\}$; let $n(r)$ denote the image of $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Assign to each real number $c$ a sequence $\\left\\{r_{k}(c)\\right\\}_{k=1}^{\\infty}$ that converges to $c$ and consists of rational numbers different from $c$. Let\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& A_{c}=\\left\\{n\\left(r_{k}(c)\\right): k=1,2, \\ldots\\right\\} \\subset N \\\\\n& B_{c}=N-A_{c} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt is easy to see that these sets $A_{c}$ and $B_{c}$ satisfy conditions (1), (2), and (3). Thus, we have constructed a function with the required property.\n\nSolution 2. Arrange the set of rational numbers into a sequence $r_{1}, r_{2}$, .... Define the function $f(x, y)$ the following way:\n\nIf $x=y$, put $f(x, y)=1$\n\nIf $x<y$, put $f(x, y)=2 i$, where $i$ is smallest possible with $x<r_{i}<y$ If $x>y$, put $f(x, y)=2 i+1$, where $i$ is smallest possible with $x>r_{i}>y$. We show that $f(x, y)$ is as required. It is obviously defined on the reals, and its range is the set of natural numbers.\n\nSuppose that\n\n$$\nf(x, y)=f(y, z)=m\n$$\n\nIf $m=1$, then $x=y=z$ is the only possibility. If $m>1$ and $m=2 i$, then\n\n$$\nx<r_{i}<y \\quad \\text { and } \\quad y<r_{i}<z\n$$\n\nwhich is a contradiction. Similarly, if $m>1$ and $m=2 i+1$, then\n\n$$\nx>r_{i}>y \\quad \\text { and } \\quad y>r_{i}>z,\n$$\n\nwhich is again a contradiction. Therefore, $x=y=z$ follows.\n\nSolution 3. We will decompose the plane into a countable family of pairwise disjoint subsets with the following property: if one of the lines parallel to the coordinate axes through the point $(y, y)$ intersects one of the subsets, then the other does not, except when the subset is the line $x=y$, which will be one of the subsets. It suffices to construct such a partition of the open half-plane below the line $x=y$, because by reflecting in the line $x=y$ and adding the line $x=y$, we obtain the required partition of the whole plane.\n\nPut\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_{0} & =\\{(x, y): x>0, \\quad y<0\\}, \\\\\nA_{k}^{0} & =\\{(x, y): x>k, \\quad k-1<y \\leq k\\} \\\\\nA_{-k}^{0} & =\\{(x, y):-k<x \\leq-k+1, \\quad y \\leq-k\\} \\\\\nA_{n}^{k} & =\\left\\{(x, y): \\frac{2 k-1}{2^{n}}<x \\leq \\frac{2 k}{2^{n}}, \\quad \\frac{2 k-2}{2^{n}}<y \\leq \\frac{2 k-1}{2^{n}}\\right\\}, \\\\\nA_{-k}^{n} & =\\left\\{(x, y): \\frac{-2 k+1}{2^{n}}<x \\leq \\frac{-2 k+2}{2^{n}}, \\quad \\frac{-2 k}{2^{n}}<y \\leq \\frac{-2 k+1}{2^{n}}\\right\\},\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $k, n=1,2, \\ldots$. It is obvious that the union of these sets is the open half-plane below the line $x=y$.\n\nThis defines a partition of the whole plane, as we said above. Label the sets of this partition by the natural numbers, and assign to the point $(x, y)$ the label of the set containing $(x, y)$ as the value of the function $f(x, y)$.\n\nIf $x, y, z$ are real numbers with $f(x, y)=f(y, z)$, then the points $(x, y)$ and $(y, z)$ are in the same subsets, but then $(x, y)$ (and $(y, z))$ is on the line through the point $(y, y)$ parallel to the $x$-axis ( $y$-axis, respectively), and any of the subsets can only meet one of these, except for the subset $\\{(x, y): x=y\\}$, but then $x=y=z$.\n\n\\section{Remarks.}\n\n1. Obviously, the existence of such a function is a question of cardinality. In general, it makes sense to ask whether there exists a function $f(x, y)$ defined on a set $A$ of cardinality $\\mathfrak{m}$ that takes its values in a set $B$ of cardinality $\\mathfrak{n}$ (both $\\mathfrak{m}$ and $\\mathfrak{n}$ are infinite) and for which $f(x, y)=f(y, z)$ implies $x=y=z$. J. Gerlits, L. Lov\u00e1sz, L. P\u00f3sa, and M. Simonovits proved that such a function exists if and only if $\\mathfrak{m} \\leq 2^{\\mathfrak{n}}$. Here we present the proof by P\u00f3sa. Let $\\mathfrak{m} \\leq 2^{\\mathfrak{n}}$. It suffices to give the construction for a set $A$ of cardinality $2^{\\mathfrak{n}}$. Let $\\alpha$ be the smallest ordinal of cardinality $\\mathfrak{n}$. We may assume that $A$ is the set of sequences of the numbers 0 and 1 of order type $\\alpha$. Define the function $f(x, y)$ as follows:\n\nIf $x=y$, put $f(x, y)=0$\n\nIf $x \\neq y$, then let $\\beta$ be the smallest ordinal where the elements in $x$ and $y$ are different, let $j$ be the $\\beta$ th element of $x(j=0$ or 1$)$, and put $f(x, y)=(\\beta, j)$. The range of $f$ is the set of the symbol 0 and the ordered pairs $(\\beta, j)$, where $\\beta<\\alpha$ and $j=0$ or 1 . Therefore, it has cardinality $\\mathfrak{n}$ and can be mapped bijectively onto $B$.\n\n$f(x, y)=f(y, z)=(\\beta, j)$ means that all elements before $\\beta$ agree both in $x$ and $y$, and in $y$ and $z$, and the $\\beta$ th element is $j$ in $x$ and $y$. But then the $\\beta$ th elements of $x$ and $y$ are equal, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $f(x, y)=f(y, z)=0$, which implies that $x=y=z$. (This part of the statement is also proved by Bollob\u00e1s and Juh\u00e1sz.)\n\nSuppose that $\\mathfrak{m}>2^{\\mathfrak{n}}$, and there exists a function required in the problem. Consider the range of $f(x, y)$ when $x$ is kept fixed. This is a subset of $B$, and since the cardinality of all possible $x$ 's is greater than the cardinality of the set of all subsets of $B$, for some $x_{1} \\neq x_{2}$ the range of $f\\left(x_{1}, y\\right)$ equals that of $f\\left(x_{2}, y\\right)$. So, the value $f\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)$ is contained in the range of $f\\left(x_{2}, y\\right)$, that is, for some $y_{0}, f\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)=f\\left(x_{2}, y_{0}\\right)$, which is a contradiction.\n\n2. B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s and Mikl\u00f3s Simonovits notice that there exists a function $F\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ defined on the real numbers that takes its values in the natural numbers, and for which\n\n$$\nF\\left(a, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)=F\\left(y_{1}, a, y_{3}, \\ldots, y_{n}\\right)=\\cdots=F\\left(u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{n-1}, a\\right)\n$$\n\nimplies $a=x_{i}=y_{i}=\\cdots=u_{i}(i=1,2, \\ldots, n)$. For example\n\n$$\nF\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)=\\prod_{i, j=1}^{n} p_{i j}^{f\\left(x_{i}, x_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nis such a function, where the $p_{i j}(i, j=1, \\ldots, n)$ are different primes, and $f(x, y)$ is the function defined in either solution of the problem.\n\nProblem N.2. Prove that there exists an ordered set in which every uncountable subset contains an uncountable, well-ordered subset and that cannot be represented as a union of a countable family of well-ordered subsets.", "Answer Candidates": [], "Images": [], "Output Format Instructions": "", "Solution": "Let $R$ be the set of all limit ordinals less than $\\omega_{1}$, and for $\\alpha \\in R$, let $f_{\\alpha}(n)$ be a monotone increasing sequence (of order type $\\omega$ ) of ordinals converging to $\\alpha$. Order $R$ as follows: for $\\alpha, \\beta \\in R, \\alpha \\prec \\beta$ if $f_{\\alpha}(n)<f_{\\beta}(n)$ holds for the first $n$ with $f_{\\alpha}(n) \\neq f_{\\beta}(n)$. Any uncountable subset $X$ of $R$ contains a well-ordered subset of order type $\\omega_{1}$ with respect to the ordering $\\prec$. Indeed, let\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nX \\mid n=\\left\\{\\left(\\alpha_{0}, \\alpha_{1}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}\\right):\\right. & \\text { there exists } \\alpha \\in X, \\text { such that } f_{\\alpha}(m)=\\alpha(m) \\\\\n& \\text { for all } m \\leq n\\} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor $n$ sufficiently large, $X \\mid n$ is uncountable, since for large enough $n$ the ordinal\n\n$$\n\\gamma_{n}=\\sup \\left\\{f_{\\alpha}(n): \\alpha \\in X\\right\\}\n$$\n\nequals $\\omega_{1}$, since, by $f_{\\alpha}(n) \\rightarrow \\alpha$\n\n$$\n\\sup \\left\\{\\gamma_{n}: n<\\omega\\right\\}=\\sup \\{\\alpha: \\alpha \\in X\\}=\\omega_{1}\n$$\n\nOrder $X \\mid n$ lexicographically, that is,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\alpha_{0}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}\\right) \\prec^{\\prime}\\left(\\beta_{0}, \\ldots, \\beta_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nif $\\alpha_{m}<\\beta_{m}$ for the smallest $m$ with $\\alpha_{m} \\neq \\beta_{m}$. Then $X \\mid n$ is well-ordered and, if $n$ is large enough for $X \\mid n$ to be uncountable, it contains a wellordered subset of order type $\\omega_{1}$. Let $X^{\\prime}$ be a subset of $X$ such that for any\n\n$$\n\\left(\\alpha_{0}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{n}\\right) \\in X \\mid n\n$$\n\nthere exists a unique $\\alpha \\in X^{\\prime}$ with\n\n$$\nf_{\\alpha}(0)=\\alpha_{0}, \\ldots, f_{\\alpha}(n)=\\alpha_{n}\n$$\n\nThen the ordered set $\\left(X^{\\prime}, \\prec\\right)$ is isorr rrphic to $\\left(X \\mid n, \\prec^{\\prime}\\right)$. Since we have seen that the latter contains a well-ordered subset of order type $\\omega_{1}$, the same is true of the former. This is what we wanted to prove.\n\nNow we show that $R$ is not a union of a countable family of well-ordered subsets. First we make a digression.\n\nA function that maps a set of ordinals into the ordinals is called regressive if $f(\\xi)<\\xi$ holds for all ordinals $\\xi \\neq 0$ in the domain of $f$. If the domain of $f$ is a subset of $\\omega_{1}$ and the set\n\n$$\n\\{\\xi: f(\\xi)<\\mu\\}\n$$\n\nis not cofinal with $\\omega_{1}$ for any $\\mu<\\omega_{1}$, then $f$ is called divergent. $X \\subseteq \\omega_{1}$ is called thin if there exists a regressive divergent function defined on $X$; otherwise, it is called stationary.\n\nThe set $\\omega_{1}$ is stationary. Indeed, assuming that $f$ is a regressive function on $\\omega_{1}$, the sequence\n\n$$\n\\xi, f(\\xi), f(f(\\xi)), \\ldots\n$$\n\nbeing a descending sequence of ordinals, can contain only a finite number of elements different from zero. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\omega_{1}=\\bigcup_{n<\\omega} X_{n}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nX_{0}=\\{0\\}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nX_{n+1}=\\left\\{\\xi: f(\\xi) \\in X_{n}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nAssuming further that $f$ is divergent, induction on $n$ shows that $\\sup X_{n}<$ $\\omega_{1}$ for all $n$, which obviously is a contradiction.\n\nFrom this it easily follows that the set $R$ of limit ordinals less than $\\omega_{1}$ is also stationary.\n\nIt quickly follows from the definition that the union of a countable family of thin sets is also thin. Further, if $X$ is stationary and $f$ is a regressive function on $X$, then for some $\\mu<\\omega_{1}$ the set\n\n$$\nX_{\\mu}=\\{\\xi: f(\\xi)=\\mu\\}\n$$\n\nis stationary (this is a special case of Fodor's theorem). Indeed, assume that all $X_{\\mu}$ are thin, and let $f_{\\mu}$ be a regressive divergent function defined on $X_{\\mu}$. Then the function $g$ defined on $X$ by\n\n$$\ng(\\xi)=\\max \\left(\\mu, f_{\\mu}(\\xi)\\right) \\quad\\left(\\xi \\in X_{\\mu}, \\mu<\\omega_{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nis regressive. It is divergent, too, because for all $\\nu<\\omega_{1}$ the set\n\n$$\n\\{\\xi: g(\\xi)<\\nu\\} \\subseteq \\bigcup_{\\mu<\\nu}\\left\\{\\xi: f_{\\mu}(\\xi)<\\nu\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis not cofinal with $\\omega_{1}$, since neither one of the summands in the righthand side is, because the functions $f_{\\mu}$ are divergent. This contradicts the assumption that $X$ is stationary, which proves our statement.\n\nLet $X \\subseteq R$ be stationary. We show that $X$ is not well ordered with respect to the ordering $\\prec$. Put $Y_{-1}=X$ and\n\n$$\nY_{n}=\\left\\{\\alpha \\in Y_{n-1}: f_{\\alpha}(n)=\\delta_{n}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_{n}$ is the smallest ordinal for which $Y_{n}$ is stationary (such $\\delta_{n}$ exists by the Fodor theorem proved above).\n\nPut\n\n$$\nX^{\\prime}=X-\\bigcup_{n<\\omega} Y_{n}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nY_{n}^{\\prime}=\\left\\{\\alpha \\in Y_{n-1}: f_{\\alpha}(n)<\\delta_{n}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nBy the choice of $\\delta_{n}, Y_{n}^{\\prime}$ is not stationary, and neither is $X-X^{\\prime}$.\n\nPut\n\n$$\n\\delta=\\sup \\left\\{\\delta_{n}: n<\\omega\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIt is obvious that $\\delta<\\omega_{1}$. Let $\\alpha \\in X^{\\prime}$ be greater than $\\delta$. ( $X^{\\prime}$ is stationary and so it is cofinal with $\\omega_{1}$.) Since $f_{\\alpha}(n) \\rightarrow \\alpha$, for some $n<\\omega$ we have\n\n$$\nf_{\\alpha}(n)>\\delta \\geq \\delta_{n}\n$$\n\nso $f_{\\alpha}(m)=\\delta_{m}$ cannot hold for all $m$. It follows from $\\alpha \\in X^{\\prime}$ that $f_{\\alpha}(m)>$ $\\delta_{m}$ for the smallest $m$ with $f_{\\alpha}(m) \\neq \\delta_{m}$. Thus, for this $m, \\alpha$ is greater than all elements of $Y_{m}$ with respect to the ordering $\\prec$.\n\nPut $X_{0}=X, \\alpha_{0}=\\alpha$, and $X_{1}=Y_{m}$. Since $Y_{m}$ is stationary, we can repeat the above argument with $X_{1}$ instead of $X_{0}$. We obtain $\\alpha_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, then $\\alpha_{2}$ and $X_{3}$, and so on. Since $\\alpha_{0} \\succ \\alpha_{1} \\succ \\alpha_{2} \\succ \\ldots, X$ is not wellordered with respect to the ordering $\\prec$, and this is what we wanted to prove.\n\nNow, if $R=\\bigcup_{n<\\omega} R_{n}$, then some $R_{n}$ is stationary, and this $R_{n}$ is not well-ordered with respect to $\\prec$. This proves the second statement of the problem.\n\nRemark. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai showed that for each cardinal number $\\kappa>\\omega$, there exists an ordered set $B$ of cardinality $\\kappa$ such that all subsets of cardinality $\\kappa$ contain a well-ordered subset of cardinality $\\kappa$ and $B$ is not a union of a family of cardinality less than $\\kappa$ of well-ordered subsets.\n\nProblem N.3. Let $\\leq$ be a reflexive, antisymmetric relation on a finite set $A$. Show that this relation can be extended to an appropriate finite superset $B$ of $A$ such that $\\leq$ on $B$ remains reflexive, antisymmetric, and any two elements of $B$ have a least upper bound as well as a greatest lower bound. (The relation $\\leq$ is extended to $B$ if for $x, y \\in A, x \\leq y$ holds in $A$ if and only if it holds in $B$.)\n\nSolution. $B$ will consist of all the elements and subsets of $A$ without identifying the elements with the corresponding singletons. In what follows, lowercase letters denote elements, whire capitals mean subsets.\n\nDefine $\\leq$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\na \\leq b, & \\text { as given, } \\\\\na \\leq P, & \\text { if } a \\in P, \\\\\nP \\leq a, & \\text { if } a \\notin P, \\\\\nP \\leq Q, & \\text { if } P \\subseteq Q .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThis is obviously a reflexive and antisymmetric relation. To show the other property, it suffices to treat incomparable elements, that is, two incomparable elements in $A$, or two subsets of $A$, none containing the other, as a subset.\n\nIf $a, b \\in A$ are incomparable, $\\{a, b\\}, A \\backslash\\{a, b\\}$ are the least upper (resp. greatest lower) bounds. If $P, Q \\subseteq A$, then $P \\cup Q$ and $P \\cap Q$ will serve as the least upper and greatest lower bounds.\n\nProblem N.4. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a family of subsets of a ground set $X$ such that $\\cup_{F \\in \\mathcal{F}} F=X$, and\n\n(a) if $A, B \\in \\mathcal{F}$, then $A \\cup B \\subseteq C$ for some $C \\in \\mathcal{F}$;\n\n(b) if $A_{n} \\in \\mathcal{F}(n=0,1, \\ldots), B \\in \\mathcal{F}$, and $A_{0} \\subset A_{1} \\subset \\ldots$, then, for some $k \\geq 0, A_{n} \\cap B=A_{k} \\cap B$ for all $n \\geq k$. Show that there exist pairwise disjoint sets $X_{\\gamma}(\\gamma \\in \\Gamma)$, with $X=$ $\\cup\\left\\{X_{\\gamma}: \\gamma \\in \\Gamma\\right\\}$, such that every $X_{\\gamma}$ is contained in some member of $\\mathcal{F}$, and every element of $\\mathcal{F}$ is contained in the union of finitely many $X_{\\gamma}$ 's.\n\nSolution. Let $<$ be a well-ordering of $F$. Let $\\Gamma$ be the set of all finite subsets of $F$. Well order $\\Gamma$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\gamma_{1}, \\gamma_{2} \\in \\Gamma, \\gamma_{1} \\neq \\gamma_{2}, \\gamma_{1}=\\left\\{A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{n}\\right\\}, \\gamma_{2}=\\left\\{B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{m}\\right\\} \\\\\n& A_{n}<\\cdots<A_{1}, B_{m}<\\ldots B_{1}, m \\leq n\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nPut $\\gamma_{1}>\\gamma_{2}$ if $A_{i}=B_{i}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq m$. If, on the other hand, $i \\leq m$ is the least number with $A_{i} \\neq B_{i}$ then put $\\gamma_{1}<\\gamma_{2}$ or $\\gamma_{1}>\\gamma_{2}$ if $A_{i}<B_{i}$ or $A_{i}>B_{i}$. A straightforward checking shows that this well orders $\\Gamma$. We notice that $\\gamma_{1} \\leq \\gamma_{2}$ implies $\\gamma_{1}<\\gamma_{2}$.\n\nFor $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$, we define $Y_{\\gamma} \\in F$ as follows. If $\\gamma=\\{A\\}$, put $Y_{\\gamma}=A$. Assume that $Y_{\\delta}$ is defined for $\\delta<\\gamma$. Then let $Y_{\\gamma}$ be a member of $F$, covering every $Y_{\\beta}(\\beta<\\gamma)$. This is possible by (a).\n\nNow put $X_{\\gamma}=Y_{\\gamma} \\backslash \\cup_{\\delta<\\gamma} Y_{\\delta}$. The only nontrivial thing to prove is that every $A \\in F$ is covered by finitely many $X_{\\beta}$. We prove by transfinite induction on $\\gamma$ that $Y_{\\gamma}$ is covered by finitely many $X_{\\delta}$ 's. If this first fails for $\\gamma$, there exists $\\beta_{1}<\\beta_{2}<\\cdots<\\gamma$ such that $Y_{\\gamma} \\cap X_{\\beta_{n}} \\neq \\emptyset$. Let $Y_{\\gamma}=\\left\\{A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{k}\\right\\}, A_{1}>\\cdots>A_{k}$. For every $n$ there is a $1 \\leq j \\leq k$ such that\n\n$$\nA_{1}, \\ldots, A_{j-1} \\in \\beta_{n}, \\quad A_{j} \\notin \\beta_{n} .\n$$\n\nWe can assume, by shrinking, that $j$ is the same for every $n$. Put $\\eta_{n}=$ $\\max \\left(\\beta_{1}, \\ldots, \\beta_{n}\\right)<\\gamma$. As $\\gamma$ is minimal, $Y_{\\beta_{n}}$ meets finitely many $X_{\\beta}$. As $Y_{\\eta_{1}} \\subset Y_{\\eta_{2}} \\subset \\ldots$, by (b) there is an $m$ such that $Y_{\\eta_{m}} \\cap Y_{\\gamma}=Y_{\\eta_{m+1}} \\cap Y_{\\gamma}=\\ldots$, so $Y_{\\eta_{m}} \\supseteq Y_{\\eta_{m+i}} \\cap Y_{\\gamma} \\supseteq X_{\\eta_{m+i}} \\cap Y_{\\gamma} \\neq \\emptyset(i=0,1, \\ldots)$ that is, $Y_{\\eta_{m}}$ meets $X_{\\eta_{m}}, X_{\\eta_{m+1}}, \\ldots$, a contradiction.\n\nProblem N.5. Show that there exists a tournament $(T, \\rightarrow)$ of cardinality $\\aleph_{1}$ containing no transitive subtournament of size $\\aleph_{1}$. (A structure $(T, \\rightarrow)$ is a tournament if $\\rightarrow$ is a binary, irreflexive, asymmetric, and trichotomic relation. The tournament $(T, \\rightarrow)$ is transitive if $\\rightarrow$ is transitive, that is, if it orders $T$.)\n\nSolution. We use the existence of a Specker type, that is, an ordered set $(A,<)$ of size $\\aleph_{1}$, not containing subsets similar to $\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{1}^{*}$, any uncountable subset of the reals. See (P. Erd\u0151s, A. Hajnal, A. M\u00e1t\u00e9, R. Rado, Combinatorial set theory: Partition Relations for Cardinals, Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3, Budapest, 1984, p. 326.) Enumerate $A$ as $\\left\\{a(\\alpha): \\alpha<\\omega_{1}\\right\\}$, and let $\\left\\{x(\\alpha): \\alpha<\\omega_{1}\\right\\}$ be different real numbers in $[0,1]$.

Let $B \\subseteq A$ be uncountable. Let $X=\\left\\{\\alpha<\\omega_{1}: a(\\alpha) \\in B\\right\\}$.\n\nClaim 1. There is an $\\alpha \\in X$ such that\n\n$$\n\\{\\beta \\in X: a(\\alpha)<a(\\beta) \\text { and } x(\\alpha)<x(\\beta)\\}\n$$\n\nis uncountable.\n\nProof. For $a \\in B$, let $f(a)$ be the least $t \\in[0,1]$ such that $x(\\beta)<t$ for all but countably many $\\beta \\in X, a(\\beta)>a$. Since $f$ is a non-increasing real-valued function on $(A,<)$, it can only have countably many different values; otherwise, there would be an uncountable subset of $A$, similar to a set of reals. Hence $f$ is constant on an uncountable $B_{0} \\subseteq B$. Define $X_{0}$ analogously to $X$. We can choose $\\alpha_{0} \\in X_{0}$ such that $\\left\\{\\beta \\in X_{0}: x(\\beta)>\\right.$ $\\left.x\\left(\\alpha_{0}\\right)\\right\\}$ is uncountable; otherwise $(A,<)$ would contain a subset of type $\\omega_{1}^{*}$. Now we can choose $\\alpha \\in X_{0}$ such that $a(\\alpha)>a\\left(\\alpha_{0}\\right)$ and $x(\\alpha)<x\\left(\\alpha_{0}\\right)$. Since $g(a(\\alpha))=g\\left(a\\left(\\alpha_{0}\\right)\\right)>x(\\alpha)$, there are uncountably many $\\beta \\in X$ such that $a(\\beta)>a(\\alpha)$ and $x(\\beta)>x(\\alpha)$.\n\nClaim 2. There are uncountable $X_{0}, X_{1} \\subseteq X$ such that if $\\alpha \\in X_{0}$, $\\beta \\in X_{1}$, then $a(\\alpha)<a(\\beta)$ and $x(\\alpha)<x(\\beta)$.\n\nProof. Let $U$ be the set of those $\\alpha \\in X$ such that\n\n$$\n\\{\\beta \\in X: a(\\alpha)<a(\\beta) \\text { and } x(\\alpha)<x(\\beta)\\}\n$$\n\nis countable, and let $L$ be the set of those $\\alpha \\in X$ such that\n\n$$\n\\{\\beta \\in X: a(\\beta)<a(\\alpha) \\text { and } x(\\beta)<x(\\alpha)\\}\n$$\n\nis countable. If $U$ or $L$ is uncountable, we get a contradiction by Claim 1, so we can select $\\alpha \\in X \\backslash U \\backslash L$, and put\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& X_{0}=\\{\\beta \\in X: a(\\beta)<a(\\alpha) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x(\\beta)<x(\\alpha)\\} \\\\\n& X_{1}=\\{\\beta \\in X: a(\\alpha)<a(\\beta) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x(\\alpha)<x(\\beta)\\} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy an application of Claim 2 to $X_{0}$ and the Specker type $(A,>)$, one can find $Y_{0}, Y_{1} \\subseteq X_{0}$ such that $\\alpha \\in Y_{0}, \\beta \\in Y_{1}$ imply $a(\\alpha)<a(\\beta)$, and $x(\\alpha)>x(\\beta)$. Now select $\\alpha \\in Y_{0}, \\beta \\in X_{1}, \\gamma \\in Y_{1}$ with $\\alpha<\\beta<\\gamma$. Then $\\alpha \\leftarrow \\beta \\leftarrow \\gamma$ and $\\gamma \\leftarrow \\alpha$, so our tournament is not transitive on $B$.\n\nRemark. The result in the problem was first proved by R. Laver.\n\nProblem N.6. Assume that $R$, a recursive, binary relation on $\\mathbb{N}$ (the set of natural numbers), orders $\\mathbb{N}$ into type $\\omega$. Show that if $f(n)$ is the $n$th element of this order, then $f$ is not necessarily recursive.\n\nSolution. We use the following well-known facts. There is a set $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ that is recursively enumerable, that is, the range of a recursive function, but is not recursive, namely, its characteristic function is not recursive. For every infinite r.e. set $A$ there is a recursive function enumerating $A$ 's elements in a one-to-one manner. An infinite set possesses an increasing such enumeration if and only if it is recursive.\n\nTake a (necessarily infinite) r.e. but not recursive set $A$, and a function $g$ enumerating $A$ without repetition. Put $a R b$ iff $g(a)<g(b)$. Clearly, $R$ is recursive and orders $\\mathbb{N}$ into type $\\omega$. If $f(n)=$ the $n$th element by this order, and $f$ is recursive, then the recursive $h(n)=g(f(n))$ would enumerate $A$ 's elements in increasing order, which is impossible.\n\nProblem N.7. Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be the class of all graphs with at most $2^{\\aleph_{0}}$ vertices not containing a complete subgraph of size $\\aleph_{1}$. Show that there is no graph $H \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that every graph in $\\mathcal{H}$ is a subgraph of $H$.\n\nSolution. We have to show that if $(V, G)$, a graph with $|V|=2^{\\aleph_{0}}$, does not contain a complete graph on $\\aleph_{1}$ vertices, then there is a graph $(W, H)$ with these properties such that $(W, H)$ cannot be embedded into $(V, G)$.\n\nLet $W$ be the set of those functions injecting a countable ordinal (possibly $O \\neq \\emptyset$ ) into a complete subgraph of $G$. To define $H$, join two such functions if one extends the other. Clearly,\n\n$$\n|W|=\\sum_{\\alpha<\\omega_{1}}|\\alpha \\rightarrow V| \\leq \\aleph_{1} \\cdot\\left(2^{\\aleph_{0}}\\right)^{\\aleph_{0}}=2^{\\aleph_{0}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we show that $(W, H)$ does not contain a complete $\\aleph_{1}$-gon. Assume that $\\left\\{f_{\\alpha}: \\alpha<\\omega_{1}\\right\\}$ are pairwise joined, and that the ordinals $\\operatorname{Dom}\\left(f_{\\alpha}\\right)$ are in increasing order. By the construction of $H$, for $\\beta<\\alpha, f_{\\alpha}$ extends $f_{\\beta}$, so the union of the $f_{\\alpha}$ 's gives a function $f: \\omega_{1} \\rightarrow V$ onto a complete $\\aleph_{1}$-gon in $(V, G)$, a contradiction.\n\nNext we prove that $(W, H)$ may not be embedded into $(V, G)$. Assume that $h: W \\rightarrow V$ is such an embedding. By transfinite recursion on $\\alpha<\\omega_{1}$, we define $f_{\\alpha}: \\alpha \\rightarrow V, f_{\\alpha} \\in W$, and $x_{\\alpha}=h\\left(f_{\\alpha}\\right) \\in V$ in such a way that $f_{\\alpha}$ extends $f_{\\beta}$ for $\\beta<\\alpha$. Put $f_{0}=\\emptyset, f_{0} \\in W$. If $f_{\\beta}(\\beta<\\alpha)$ are defined, then\n\n$$\n\\left\\{x_{\\beta}: \\beta<\\alpha\\right\\}=h\\left\\{f_{\\beta}: \\beta<\\alpha\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis a complete subgraph, so we can define $f_{\\alpha}(\\beta)=x_{\\beta}$. This clearly satisfies the requirements. But then $\\left\\{x_{\\alpha}: \\alpha<\\omega_{1}\\right\\}$ is a complete subgraph in $G$, a contradiction.\n\nRemark. This is an unpublished result of R.

Clearly, $B$ is an open set. If $x \\in C$, let $r_{x}$ be a rational point in the interior of the interval $I_{\\gamma}$ that has the left-hand endpoint $x$. Points $r_{x}$ corresponding to distinct points $x$ are distinct since in the case $x<y, r_{x}=r_{y}$, the point $y$ would lie in the interior of the interval $I_{\\gamma}$ starting at $x$. Consequently, $C$, and similarly $D$, is countable. So each of the sets $B, C, D$, and therefore $A$ as well is of type $F_{\\sigma}$.\n\nRemark. It is interesting that for the left-hand and right-hand derivatives a similar theorem does not hold. For instance, if $E$ is a nonmeasurable set that along with its complementary set is dense, and $f(x)$ is the characteristic function of $E$, then $\\bar{D}^{+} f(x)=0$ or $+\\infty$ if $x \\in E$ or $x \\notin E$, respectively, and so $\\bar{D}^{+} f(x)$ is nonmeasurable in this case.\n\nIt should be noted that in the book by S. Saks (Theory of the Integral, Hafner, New York, 1937, Vitali's covering theorem, pp. 112-113), the author proves only Lebesgue measurability of $\\bar{D} f$ and $\\underline{D} f$ with much more powerful tools, although generalized to arbitrary dimension. Problem M.2. Let $E$ be a bounded subset of the real line, and let $\\Omega$ be a system of (nondegenerate) closed intervals such that for each $x \\in E$ there exists an $I \\in \\Omega$ with left endpoint $x$. Show that for every $\\varepsilon>0$ there exist a finite number of pairwise nonoverlapping intervals belonging to $\\Omega$ that cover $E$ with the exception of a subset of outer measure less than $\\varepsilon$.\n\nSolution. Let $\\Delta$ be a bounded open interval containing $E$. Denote by $S_{n}$ the set of all points of $\\Delta$ having neighborhoods not containing points of $E$ that are starting points of intervals belonging to $\\Omega$ and longer than $1 / n$. Obviously $S_{n}$ is an open set, $S_{n+1} \\subset S_{n}$ and, furthermore, $\\left(\\cap_{n=1}^{\\infty} S_{n}\\right) \\cap E=0$ since at each point of $E$ there begins at least one nondegenerate interval belonging to $\\Omega$ and if $\\frac{1}{n}$ is already less than the length of the latter, then the point cannot belong to $S_{n}$. It is a well-known property of the outer measure that for any set $A$ the outer measure $\\lambda^{*}(X \\cap A)$ as a function of $X$ is a measure on the Lebesgue-measurable sets. Thus, taking $A=E$ and using the relation $S_{n+1} \\subset S_{n}$ as well as the finiteness of the outer measure of $E$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\lim _{n \\rightarrow+\\infty} \\lambda^{*}\\left(S_{n} \\cap E\\right)=\\lambda^{*}\\left(\\left(\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} S_{n}\\right) \\cap E\\right)=\\lambda^{*}(0)=0 .\n$$\n\nFix $n_{0}$ so that $\\lambda^{*}\\left(S_{n_{0}} \\cap E\\right)<\\varepsilon / 2$. If the set $E_{1}=E-\\left(S_{n_{0}} \\cap E\\right)$ is nonempty, which we may assume, then in each neighborhoood of any of its points there is a point of $E$ that is also a point of $E_{1}$ and at which an interval longer than $1 / n_{0}$ begins. There is a point $a_{1} \\in E_{1}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\lambda^{*}\\left(\\left(-\\infty, a_{1}\\right) \\cap E_{1}\\right)<\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2\\left(n_{0} \\lambda(\\Delta)+1\\right)}\n$$\n\nand by the former arguments we may assume at once that some interval $\\left[a_{1}, b_{1}\\right]$ starting from $a_{1}$ and belonging to $\\Omega$ is longer than $1 / n_{0}$. Then we choose (if still possible) a point $a_{2} \\in E_{1}$ such that $a_{2}>b_{1}$,\n\n$$\n\\lambda^{*}\\left(\\left(b_{1}, a_{2}\\right) \\cap E_{1}\\right)<\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2\\left(n_{0} \\lambda(\\Delta)+1\\right)}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\left[a_{2}, b_{2}\\right] \\in \\Omega, \\quad b_{2}-a_{2}>\\frac{1}{n_{0}}\n$$\n\nand so on. The procedure ends after a finite number of steps, namely we can construct at most $n_{0} \\lambda(\\Delta)+1$ intervals $\\left[a_{k}, b_{k}\\right]$ in this way (since $\\left.b_{k}-a_{k}>1 / n_{0}\\right)$. What is left out from $E$ by these intervals is covered by $S_{n_{0}} \\cap E$ and the not more than $n_{0} \\lambda(\\Delta)+1$ sets $\\left(b_{k-1}, a_{k}\\right) \\cap E_{1}\\left(b_{0}=-\\infty\\right)$ of outer measure not exceeding $\\varepsilon /\\left(2\\left(n_{0} \\lambda(\\Delta)+1\\right)\\right)$. Their total outer measure is less than $\\varepsilon$, which completes the proof. \n\n\\section{Remarks.}\n\n1. In addition to being nonoverlapping, the intervals we have chosen are disjoint.\n\n2. The assertion cannot be replaced by the stronger statement that it is possible to choose an at most countable number of nonoverlapping intervals such that the part not covered by them has measure 0 . This is shown by the following simple example: $E=(0,1), \\quad \\Omega=\\{[x, 1]: x \\in(0,1)\\}$.\n\nProblem M.3. Let $f(t)$ be a continuous function on the interval $0 \\leq$ $t \\leq 1$, and define the two sets of points\n\n$$\nA_{t}=\\{(t, 0): t \\in[0,1]\\}, \\quad B_{t}=\\{(f(t), 1): t \\in[0,1]\\}\n$$\n\nShow that the union of all segments $\\overline{A_{t} B_{t}}$ is Lebesgue-measurable, and find the minimum of its measure with respect to all functions $f$.\n\nSolution. We first show that the set $A=\\cup_{0 \\leq t \\leq 1} \\overline{A_{t} B_{t}}$ is closed, hence Lebesgue-measurable. Let $P_{n}$ be a convergent sequence of points in $A$, $P_{n} \\rightarrow P_{0}$. By the definition of $A$, to every $n$ there is a $t_{n}$ such that $P_{n} \\in$ $\\overline{A_{t_{n}} B_{t_{n}}}$. According to the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, the sequence $t_{n}$ contains a convergent subsequence: $t_{n_{k}} \\rightarrow t_{0}$. The distance from the point $P_{n_{k}}$ to the segment $\\overline{A_{t_{0}} B_{t_{0}}}$ is not greater than $\\max \\left\\{\\left|f\\left(t_{n_{k}}\\right)-f\\left(t_{0}\\right)\\right|, \\mid t_{n_{k}}-\\right.$ $\\left.t_{0} \\mid\\right\\}$, which tends to 0 by the continuity of $f(t)$. It follows that $P_{0} \\in$ $\\overline{A_{t_{0}} B_{t_{0}}} \\subseteq A$. Since $A$ contains the limit point of any convergent sequence of its points, $A$ is closed.\n\nA simple calculation shows that the point of the segment $\\overline{A_{t} B_{t}}$ that lies on the straight line $y=c$ has abscissa $(1-c) t+c f(t)$, which, by the continuity of $f(t)$, is a continuous function of $t$. Consequently, if two points of the set $A$ lie on the line $y=c$, then $A$ contains the segment that joins these points.\n\nNow we can determine the minimum of the measure of $A$. If $f(t)$ is constant, then $A$ is a triangle of unit base and unit altitude, so it has measure $1 / 2$. If the segments $\\overline{A_{0} B_{0}}$ and $\\overline{A_{1} B_{1}}$ do not intersect, then the trapezoid with vertices $A_{0}, B_{0}, A_{1}$, and $B_{1}$ is a subset of $A$, so the measure of $A$ is not less than $1 / 2$. If the segments $\\overline{A_{0} B_{0}}$ and $\\overline{A_{1} B_{1}}$ intersect at some point $C$, then the triangles $A_{0} C A_{1}$ and $B_{0} C B_{1}$ are subsets of $A$, so the measure of $A$ is not smaller than\n\n$$\nt(d)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+d}+\\frac{d}{1+d} d\\right)=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1+d^{2}}{1+d}\n$$\n\nwhere $d$ denotes the distance from $B_{0}$ to $B_{1}$. By a simple calculation, we obtain that the minimum of $t(d)$ on the positive half-axis is $\\sqrt{2}-1$. Thus, the measure of $A$ cannot be less than $\\sqrt{2}-1$. On the other hand, for $f(t)=(\\sqrt{2}-1)(1-t)$, the measure of $A$ is exactly $\\sqrt{2}-1$.\n\nRemark. I. N. Berstein (Doklady Acad. Nauk. SSSR 146 (1962), 1113) refers to the result of the problem but he states erroneously that the minimum is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Problem M.4. $A$ \"letter $T$ \" erected at point $A$ of the $x$-axis in the $x y$ plane is the union of a segment $A B$ in the upper half-plane perpendicular to the $x$-axis and a segment $C D$ containing $B$ in its interior and parallel to the $x$-axis. Show that it is impossible to erect a letter $T$ at every point of the $x$-axis so that the union of those erected at rational points is disjoint from the union of those erected at irrational points.", "Final Answer": "It is obviously sufficient to prove the assertion for $\\bar{D} f$.
