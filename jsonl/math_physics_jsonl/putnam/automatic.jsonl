Round to 3 decimal places.", "Solution": "Consider the dual cube to the octahedron. The vertices $A, B, C, D, E, F, G$, $H$ of this cube are the centers of the faces of the octahedron (here $A B C D$ is a face of the cube and $(A, G),(B, H),(C, E),(D, F)$ are pairs of diagonally opposite vertices). Each assignment of the numbers $1,2,3,4,5,6,7$, and 8 to the faces of the octahedron corresponds to a permutation of $A B C D E F G H$, and thus to an octagonal circuit of these vertices. The cube has 16 diagonal segments that join nonadjacent vertices. The problem requires us to count octagonal circuits that can be formed by eight of these diagonals.Six of these diagonals are edges of the tetrahedron $A C F H$, six are edges of the tetrahedron $D B E G$, and four are long diagonals, joining opposite vertices of the cube. Notice that each vertex belongs to exactly one long diagonal. It follows that an octagonal circuit must contain either 2 long diagonals separated by 3 tetrahedron edges (Figure 108a), or 4 long diagonals (Figure 108b) alternating with tetrahedron edges.\nFigure 108When forming a (skew) octagon with 4 long diagonals, the four tetrahedron edges need to be disjoint; hence two are opposite edges of $A C F H$ and two are opposite edges of $D B E G$. For each of the three ways to choose a pair of opposite edges from the tetrahedron $A C F H$, there are two possible ways to choose a pair of opposite edges from tetrahedron $D B E G$. There are $3 \\cdot 2=6$ octagons of this type, and for each of them, a circuit can start at 8 possible vertices and can be traced in two different ways, making a total of $6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2=96$ permutations.An octagon that contains exactly two long diagonals must also contain a three-edge path along the tetrahedron $A C F H$ and a three-edge path along tetrahedron the $D B E G$. A three-edge path along the tetrahedron the $A C F H$ can be chosen in $4 !=24$ ways. The corresponding three-edge path along the tetrahedron $D B E G$ has predetermined initial and terminal vertices; it thus can be chosen in only 2 ways. Since this counting method treats each path as different from its reverse, there are $8 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 2=384$ permutations of this type.In all, there are $96+384=480$ permutations that correspond to octagonal circuits formed exclusively from cube diagonals. The probability of randomly choosing such a permutation is $\\frac{480}{8 !}=\\frac{1}{84}$.", "Final Answer": "$.012$"}
