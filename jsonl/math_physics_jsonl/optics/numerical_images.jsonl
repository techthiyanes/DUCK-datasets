The ultra-short pulses are produced by mode-locking a laser - a method to be studied in this problem. The model laser consists of an optical cavity of length $L$ with transverse dimensions $d$ formed by two flat mirrors as shown in the first figure.\n\nThe amplifying medium (it may be solid, liquid, or gas) can be characterized by a certain gain spectrum (see the second figure); only light within this band of frequencies will be amplified. To simplify calculation, assume the gain spectrum is rectangular as shown in the third figure.\n\nTo be specific, consider the amplifying medium Nd glass, which has $\\omega_{0}=1.8 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}, \\Delta \\omega=6 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$, and take the length of the laser to be $L=150 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nBy inserting a modulated absorber into the cavity, one can lock the phases of all the modes to the same value, so that traveling waves interfere constructively, producing light pulses. Find the intensity as a function of time in this phase-locked or mode-locked case. What is the pulse duration?
