{"Topic": "Wave Optics", "Book": "", "Problem Statement": "A beam of light, with $\\lambda=5000 \\AA$, traveling in the $z$-direction is polarised at $45^{\\circ}$ to the $x$-direction. It passes through a Kerr cell, i.e., a substance such that $n_{x}-n_{y}=K E^{2}$, where $n_{x}$ and $n_{y}$ are the refractive indices for light polarised in the $x$ and $y$ directions. $E$ is the strength of an externally applied electric field in the $x$-direction. The cell has length $1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and $K=2.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{(meter)}^{2} /\\text{(volts)}^{2}$.\n\nIf the light, after passing through the Kerr cell, passes through a polarization analyzer whose plane of polarisation is perpendicular to that of the original beam, calculate the smallest value of $E$ which gives maximum transmission. Assume the effect of the electric field on reflection at the Kerr cell is negligible.", "Answer Candidates": [], "Images": [], "Output Format Instructions": "FLOAT. Units: NONE. 4 significant figures.", "Solution": "The Kerr cell induces birefringence. As the direction of the electric field is $45^{\\circ}$ to the direction of polarisation of the light, the amplitudes of the components polarised parallel to the $x$ and $y$ directions are the same. When the phase difference $\\delta$ between the components is\n\n$$\n\\delta=\\frac{2 \\pi l\\left(n_{x}-n_{y}\\right)}{\\lambda}=\\frac{2 \\pi l K E^{2}}{\\lambda}=(2 j+1) \\pi, j=0 \\text { or integer, }\n$$\n\nthe Kerr cell acts as a half-wave plate and rotates the plane of polarization by $90^{\\circ} s 0$ that it coincides with the transmission axis of the analyzer and gives maximum transmission.
