It has a degree at most $n$. The system implies that $P(k)=k+1,1 \\leq k \\leq n$, and moreover $P(0)=1$. Hence the polynomial $P(t)-t-1$ of degree at most $n$ has $n+1$ roots, therefore, it is identically zero. Thus, $\\left(1+t x_{1}\\right)\\left(1+t x_{2}\\right) \\ldots\\left(1+t x_{n}\\right) \\equiv 1+t$. Hence one of the numbers $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}$ equals 1 and the rest of them equal 0 .  Answer: $(1,0, \\ldots, 0)$ and all permutations of these numbers", "Final Answer": "$(1,0, \\ldots, 0)$ and all permutations of these numbers."}
