        "Solution": "64. We call a number good if it satisfies the given condition. It is not difficult to see that all powers of primes are good. Suppose $n$ is a good number that has at least two distinct prime factors. Let $n=p^{r} s$, where $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n$ and $s$ is not divisible by $p$. Because $n$ is good, $p+s-1$ must divide $n$. For any prime $q$ dividing $s, s<p+s-1<s+q$, so $q$ does not divide $p+s-1$. Therefore, the only prime factor of $p+s-1$ is $p$. Then $s=p^{c}-p+1$ for some integer $c>1$. Because $p^{c}$ must also divide $n, p^{c}+s-1=2 p^{c}-p$ divides $n$. Because $2 p^{c-1}-1$ has no factors of $p$, it must divide $s$. But$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{p-1}{2}\\left(2 p^{c-1}-1\\right) &=p^{c}-p^{c-1}-\\frac{p-1}{2}<p^{c}-p+1<\\frac{p+1}{2}\\left(2 p^{c-1}-1\\right) \\\\ &=p^{c}+p^{c-1}-\\frac{p+1}{2}, \\end{aligned} $$a contradiction.

And indeed, in an inductive manner we see that $f(n)=n+1$ implies $n+1+2 f(n+1)=3 n+5$; hence $f(n+1)=n+2$.The case $f(1)=4$ gives $4+2 f(4)=8$, so $f(4)=2$.

The product of all these ratios is $a_{0} / a_{1995}=1$, which means that the product of some $m$ primes equals the product of some $1995-m$ primes. This can happen only when the primes are the same (by unique factorization), and in particular they must be in the same number on both sides.

        "Solution": "539. No! In fact, we will prove a more general result.Proposition. Let $S$ be a set and $g: S \\rightarrow S$ a function that has exactly two fixed points $\\{a, b\\}$ and such that $g \\circ g$ has exactly four fixed points $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$. Then there is no function $f: S \\rightarrow S$ such that $g=f \\circ f$. Proof. Let $g(c)=y$. Then $c=g(g(c))=g(y)$; hence $y=g(c)=g(g(y))$. Thus $y$ is a fixed point of $g \\circ g$. If $y=a$, then $a=g(a)=g(y)=c$, leading to a contradiction. Similarly, $y=b$ forces $c=b$. If $y=c$, then $c=g(y)=g(c)$, so $c$ is a fixed point of $g$, again a contradiction. It follows that $y=d$, i.e., $g(c)=d$, and similarly $g(d)=c$.Suppose there is $f: S \\rightarrow S$ such that $f \\circ f=g$. Then $f \\circ g=f \\circ f \\circ f=g \\circ f$. Then $f(a)=f(g(a))=g(f(a))$, so $f(a)$ is a fixed point of $g$. Examining case by case, we conclude that $f(\\{a, b\\}) \\subset\\{a, b\\}$ and $f(\\{a, b, c, d\\}) \\subset\\{a, b, c, d\\}$. Because $f \\circ f=g$, the inclusions are, in fact, equalities.Consider $f(c)$. If $f(c)=a$, then $f(a)=f(f(c))=g(c)=d$, a contradiction since $f(a)$ is in $\\{a, b\\}$. Similarly, we rule out $f(c)=b$. Of course, $c$ is not a fixed point of $f$, since it is not a fixed point of $g$. We are left with the only possibility $f(c)=d$. But then $f(d)=f(f(c))=g(c)=d$, and this again cannot happen because $d$ is not a fixed point of $g$. We conclude that such a function $f$ cannot exist.In the particular case of our problem, $g(x)=x^{2}-2$ has the fixed points $-1$ and 2 , and $g(g(x))=\\left(x^{2}-2\\right)^{2}-2$ has the fixed points $-1,2, \\frac{-1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, and $\\frac{-1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.

Hence$$ t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}, t_{4}, t_{5} \\in\\left\\{\\frac{\\pi}{5}, \\frac{3 \\pi}{5}, \\frac{5 \\pi}{5}\\right\\} . $$Using the fact that the roots of $x^{5}=1$, respectively, $x^{10}=1$, add up to zero, we deduce that$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\cos \\frac{2 k \\pi}{5}=0 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\sum_{k=0}^{9} \\cos \\frac{k \\pi}{5}=0 . $$It follows that$$ \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{5}+\\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{5}+\\cos \\frac{5 \\pi}{5}+\\cos \\frac{7 \\pi}{5}+\\cos \\frac{9 \\pi}{5}=0 . $$Since $\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{5}=\\cos \\frac{9 \\pi}{5}$ and $\\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{5}=\\cos \\frac{7 \\pi}{5}$, we find that $\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{5}+\\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{5}=\\frac{1}{2}$. Also, it is not hard to see that the equation $\\mathcal{T}_{5}(a)=-2$ has no rational solutions, which implies that $\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{5}$ is irrational.The first equation of the system yields $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} t_{i}=0$, and the above considerations show that this can happen only when two of the $t_{i}$ are equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{5}$, two are equal to $\\frac{3 \\pi}{5}$, and one is equal to $\\pi$. Let us show that in this situation the second equation is also satisfied. Using $\\mathcal{T}_{3}(a)=a^{3}-3 a$, we see that the first two equations are jointly equivalent to $\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\cos t_{i}=0$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\cos 3 t_{i}=0$. Thus we are left to check that this last equality is satisfied.

For example, $k=1$ yields $a b+a+b=a^{2}+b^{2}+1$, which is equivalent to $(a-b)^{2}+(a-1)^{2}+(b-1)^{2}=0$, whose only solution is $a=b=1$. Also, for $k=2$ we have $2 a b+2 a+2 b=a^{2}+b^{2}+1$.

Thus we may substitute the pair $(a, b)$ by the smaller pair $(r, a)$, provided that $0<r<a$. Let us verify first that $0<r$. Assume the contrary. Since $b r=a^{2}-k a+1$, we must have $a^{2}-k a+1 \\leq 0$. The equality case is impossible, since $a(k-a)=1$ cannot hold if $k \\geq 3$. If $a^{2}-k a+1<0$, the original divisibility condition implies $b(b-a k-k)=a k-a^{2}-1>0$, hence $b-a k-k>0$. But then $b(b-a k-k)>$ $(a k+k) \\cdot 1>a k-a^{2}-1$, a contradiction. This proves that $r$ is positive. From the fact that $b r=a^{2}-k a+1<a^{2}$ and $b \\geq a$, it follows that $r<a$. Successively, we obtain the sequence of pairs of solutions to the original problem $\\left(a_{1}, b_{1}\\right)=(a, b),\\left(a_{2}, b_{2}\\right)=(r, a)$, $\\left(a_{3}, b_{3}\\right), \\ldots$, with $a_{i} \\leq b_{i}$ and $a_{1}>a_{2}>a_{3}>\\cdots, b_{1}>b_{2}>b_{3}>\\cdots$, which of course is impossible. This shows that the ratio of $a^{2}+b^{2}+1$ to $a b+a+b$ cannot be greater than or equal to 3 , and so the answer to the problem consists of the pair $(1,1)$ together with all pairs of consecutive perfect squares.\\section{(Mathematics Magazine)}",

After examining several cases we guess that the maximal number of partitions is $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$. This is exactly the number of lines determined by two points, and we will use these lines to count the number of partitions. By pushing such a line slightly so that the two points lie on one of its sides or the other, we obtain a partition. Moreover, each partition can be obtained this way. There are $2\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ such lines, obtained by pushing the lines through the $n$ points to one side or the other. However, each partition is counted at least twice this way, except for the partitions that come from the sides of the polygon that is the convex hull of the $n$ points, but those can be paired with the partitions that cut out one vertex of the convex hull from the others. Hence we have at most $2\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right) / 2=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ partitions.Equality is achieved when the points form a convex $n$-gon, in which case $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ counts the pairs of sides that are intersected by the separating line.(67th W.L.

(a) Does there exist a pair of divergent series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_{n}, \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_{n}$, with $a_{1} \\geq a_{2} \\geq$ $a_{3} \\geq \\cdots \\geq 0$ and $b_{1} \\geq b_{2} \\geq b_{3} \\geq \\cdots \\geq 0$, such that the series $\\sum_{n} \\min \\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\\right)$ is convergent?(b) Does the answer to this question change if we assume additionally that $b_{n}=\\frac{1}{n}$, $n=1,2, \\ldots ?$ ",
        "Solution": "358. (a) We claim that the answer to the first question is yes. We construct the sequences $\\left(a_{n}\\right)_{n}$ and $\\left(b_{n}\\right)_{n}$ inductively, in a way inspired by the proof that the harmonic series diverges. At step 1 , let $a_{1}=1, b_{1}=\\frac{1}{2}$. Then at step 2 , let $a_{2}=a_{3}=\\frac{1}{8}$ and $b_{2}=b_{3}=\\frac{1}{2}$. In general, at step $k$ we already know $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n_{k}}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n_{k}}$ for some integer $n_{k}$. We want to define the next terms. If $k$ is even, and if$$ b_{n_{k}}=\\frac{1}{2^{r_{k}}}, $$let$$ b_{n_{k}+1}=\\cdots=b_{n_{k}+2^{r_{k}}}=\\frac{1}{2^{r_{k}}} $$and$$ a_{n_{k}+1}=\\cdots=a_{n_{k}+2^{r_{k}}}=\\frac{1}{2^{k} \\cdot 2^{r_{k}}} . $$If $k$ is odd, we do precisely the same thing, with the roles of the sequences $\\left(a_{n}\\right)_{n}$ and $\\left(b_{n}\\right)_{n}$ exchanged. As such we have$$ \\begin{aligned} \\sum_{n} b_{n} & \\geq \\sum_{k \\text { odd }} 2^{r_{k}} \\frac{1}{2^{r_{k}}}=1+1+\\cdots=\\infty, \\\\ \\sum_{n} a_{n} & \\geq \\sum_{k \\text { even }} 2^{r_{k}} \\frac{1}{2^{r_{k}}}=1+1+\\cdots=\\infty, \\end{aligned} $$which shows that both series diverge. On the other hand, if we let $c_{n}=\\min \\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\\right)$, then$$ \\sum_{n} c_{n}=\\sum_{k} 2^{r_{k}} \\frac{1}{2^{k} 2^{r_{k}}}=\\sum_{k} \\frac{1}{2^{k}}, $$which converges to 1 . The example proves our claim.(b) The answer to the second question is no, meaning that the situation changes if we work with the harmonic series. Suppose there is a series $\\sum_{n} a_{n}$ with the given property. If $c_{n}=\\frac{1}{n}$ for only finitely many $n$ 's, then for large $n, a_{n}=c_{n}$, meaning that both series diverge. Hence $c_{n}=\\frac{1}{n}$ for infinitely many $n$. Let $\\left(k_{m}\\right)_{m}$ be a sequence of integers satisfying $k_{m+1} \\geq 2 k_{m}$ and $c_{k_{m}}=\\frac{1}{k_{m}}$. Then$$ \\sum_{k=k_{m}+1}^{k_{m+1}} c_{k} \\geq\\left(k_{m+1}-k_{m}\\right) c_{k_{m+1}}=\\left(k_{m+1}-k_{m}\\right) \\frac{1}{k_{m+1}}=\\frac{1}{2} . $$This shows that the series $\\sum_{n} c_{n}$ diverges, a contradiction.(short list of the 44th International Mathematical Olympiad, 2003)",
