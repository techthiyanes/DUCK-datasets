        "Solution": "902. If the $m$-gon has three acute angles, say at vertices $A, B, C$, then with a fourth vertex $D$ they form a cyclic quadrilateral $A B C D$ that has three acute angles, which is impossible. Similarly, if the $m$-gon has two acute angles that do not share a side, say at vertices $A$ and $C$, then they form with two other vertices $B$ and $D$ of the $m$-gon a cyclic quadrilateral $A B C D$ that has two opposite acute angles, which again is impossible. Therefore, the $m$-gon has either exactly one acute angle, or has two acute angles and they share a side.To count the number of such $m$-gons we employ the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Thus we first find the number of $m$-gons with at least one acute angle, then subtract the number of $m$-gons with two acute angles (which were counted twice the first time). If the acute angle of the $m$-gon is $A_{k} A_{1} A_{k+r}$, the condition that this angle is acute translates into $r \\leq n$.

We are required to include a segment $y=p x+q$, $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$, between two circular arcs.The arcs are parts of two circles of radius 1 and of centers $O_{1}\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2}\\right)$ and $\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\left(0,-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2}\\right)$. By examining Figure 76 we will conclude that there is just one such segment. On the first circle, consider the points $A\\left(1, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2}\\right)$ and $B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2}\\right)$. The distance from $B$ to $O_{2}$ is $\\sqrt{2}$, which is equal to the length of the segment $A B$. In the isosceles triangle $\\mathrm{BO}_{2} \\mathrm{~A}$, the altitudes from $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $A$ must be equal. The altitude from $A$ is equal to the distance from $A$ to the $y$-axis, hence is 1 . Thus the distance from $O_{2}$ to $A B$ is 1 as well. This shows that the segment $A B$ is tangent to the circle centered at $O_{2}$. This segment lies between the two arcs, and above the entire interval $[0,1]$. Being inscribed in one arc and tangent to the other, it is the only segment with this property.This answers the problem, by showing that the only possibility is $p=-1, q=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2}$.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2022_10_30_5df578bdac2dccbf98f1g-625.jpg?height=467&width=407&top_left_y=914&top_left_x=664)Figure 76(Romanian Team Selection Test for the International Mathematical Olympiad, 1983) ",

        "Solution": "867. Let $G(x)=\\sum_{n} y_{n} x^{n}$ be the generating function of the sequence. It satisfies the functional equation$$ (1-a x) G(x)=1+b x+b x^{2}+\\cdots=\\frac{1}{1-b x} $$We find that$$ G(x)=\\frac{1}{(1-a x)(1-b x)}=\\frac{A}{1-a x}+\\frac{B}{1-b x}=\\sum_{n}\\left(A a^{n}+B b^{n}\\right) x^{n} $$for some $A$ and $B$. It follows that $y_{n}=A a^{n}+B b^{n}$, and because $y_{0}=1$ and $y_{1}=a+b$, $A=\\frac{a}{a-b}$ and $B=-\\frac{b}{a-b}$. The general term of the sequence is therefore$$ \\frac{1}{a-b}\\left(a^{n+1}-b^{n+1}\\right) . $$",

        "Solution": "235. First solution: The zeros of $P(x)$ are $\\epsilon, \\epsilon^{2}, \\ldots, \\epsilon^{n}$, where $\\epsilon$ is a primitive $(n+1)$ st root of unity. As such, the zeros of $P(x)$ are distinct. Let$$ P\\left(x^{n+1}\\right)=Q(x) \\cdot P(x)+R(x), $$where $R(x)=a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}$ is the remainder. Replacing $x$ successively by $\\epsilon, \\epsilon^{2}, \\ldots, \\epsilon^{n}$, we obtain$$ \\begin{aligned} a_{n} \\epsilon^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{1} \\epsilon+a_{0} &=n+1, \\\\ a_{n}\\left(\\epsilon^{2}\\right)^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{1} \\epsilon^{2}+a_{0} &=n+1, \\\\ & \\cdots \\\\ a_{n}\\left(\\epsilon^{n}\\right)^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{1} \\epsilon^{n}+a_{0} &=n+1, \\end{aligned} $$or$$ \\begin{aligned} {\\left[a_{0}-(n+1)\\right]+a_{1} \\epsilon+\\cdots+a_{n-1} \\epsilon^{n-1} } &=0, \\\\ {\\left[a_{0}-(n+1)\\right]+a_{1}\\left(\\epsilon^{2}\\right)+\\cdots+a_{n-1}\\left(\\epsilon^{2}\\right)^{n-1} } &=0, \\\\ & \\cdots \\\\ {\\left[a_{0}-(n+1)\\right]+a_{1}\\left(\\epsilon^{n}\\right)+\\cdots+a_{n-1}\\left(\\epsilon^{n}\\right)^{n-1} } &=0 . \\end{aligned} $$This can be interpreted as a homogeneous system in the unknowns $a_{0}-(n+1)$, $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$. The determinant of the coefficient matrix is Vandermonde, thus nonzero, and so the system has the unique solution $a_{0}-(n+1)=a_{1}=\\cdots=a_{n-1}=0$. We obtain $R(x)=n+1$.Second solution: Note that$$ x^{n+1}=(x-1) P(x)+1 ; $$hence$$ x^{k(n+1)}=(x-1)\\left(x^{(k-1)(n+1)}+x^{(k-2)(n+1)}+\\cdots+1\\right) P(x)+1 . $$Thus the remainder of any polynomial $F\\left(x^{n+1}\\right)$ modulo $P(x)$ is $F(1)$.

        "Solution": "161. First solution: Let $\\alpha=\\arctan u, \\beta=\\arctan v$, and $\\arctan w$. We are required to determine the sum $\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma$.

Therefore, $\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma=\\frac{\\pi}{4}+k \\pi$, where $k$ is an integer that remains to be determined.From Vi\u00e8te's relations we can see the product of the zeros of the polynomial is negative, so the number of negative zeros is odd.

Therefore, one of $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ lies in the interval $\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0\\right)$ and two of them lie in $\\left(0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$.
